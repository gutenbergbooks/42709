<h2>PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION.</h2>

<p>The present edition, which appears on the same general plan as
before, will yet be found to have been in great part re-written,
enlarged, and corrected.</p>

<p>Analytical methods which experience has shown to be faulty
have been omitted, and replaced by newer and more accurate
processes.</p>

<p>The intimate connection which recent research has shown to
exist between the arrangement of the constituent parts of an
organic molecule and physiological action, has been considered at
some length in a separate chapter.</p>

<p>The cadaveric alkaloids or ptomaines, bodies playing so great a
part in food-poisoning and in the manifestations of disease, are in
this edition treated of as fully as the limits of the book will
allow.</p>

<p>The author, therefore, trusts that these various improvements,
modifications, and corrections will enable &#8220;<span class="smcap">Poisons</span>&#8221; to maintain
the position which it has for so many years held in the esteem of
toxicologists and of the medical profession generally.</p>

<h2>PART I.&mdash;INTRODUCTORY.</h2>

<h3>I.&mdash;The Old Poison-Lore.</h3>

<p><a name="Sect_1" id="Sect_1"></a>&sect; 1. It is significant that the root &#8220;<i>tox</i>&#8221; of the modern word <i>toxicology</i> can
be traced back to a very ancient word meaning &#8220;bow&#8221; or &#8220;arrow,&#8221; or, in
its broadest sense, some &#8220;tool&#8221; used for slaying: hence it is no far-fetched
supposition that the first poison-knowledge was that of the septic
poisons. Perchance the savage found that weapons soiled with the blood
of former victims made wounds fatal; from this observation the next
step naturally would be that of experiment&mdash;the arrow or spear would
be steeped in all manner of offensive pastes, and smeared with the vegetable
juices of those plants which were deemed noxious; and as the
effects were mysterious, they would be ascribed to the supernatural
powers, and covered with a veil of superstition.</p>

<p>The history of the <i>poison-lehre</i>, like all history, begins in the region
of the myths: there was a dark saga prevailing in Greece, that in the far
north existed a land ruled by sorcerers&mdash;all children of the sun&mdash;and
named Ae&euml;tes, Perses, Hecate, Medea, and Circe. Later on, the enchanted
land was localised at Colchis, and Ae&euml;tes and Perses were said to be
brothers. Hecate was the daughter of Perses; she was married to
Ae&euml;tes, and their daughters were Medea and Circe. Hecate was the
discoverer of poisonous herbs, and learned in remedies both evil and good.
Her knowledge passed to Medea, who narcotised the dragon, the guardian
of the golden fleece, and incited Jason to great undertakings.</p>

<p>In the expedition of the Argonauts, the poets loved to describe Hecate&#8217;s
garden, with its lofty walls. Thrice-folding doors of ebony barred the
entrance, which was guarded by terrible forms: only the initiated few,
only they who bore the leavened rod of expiation, and the concealed conciliatory
offering of the Medea, could enter into the sanctuary. Towering
above all was the temple of the dread Hecate, whose priestesses offered
to the gods ghastly sacrifices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Sect_2" id="Sect_2"></a>&sect; 2. The oldest Egyptian king, Menes, and Attalus Phylometer, the
last king of Pergamus, were both famous for their knowledge of plants.
Attalus Phylometer was acquainted with hyoscyamus, aconite, conium,
veratrum, and others; he experimented on the preparation of poisons,
and occupied himself in compounding medicines. Mithradetes Eupator
stood yet higher: the receipt for the famous <i>theriaca</i>, prepared in later
years at an enormous price, and composed of fifty-four different ingredients,
is ascribed to him. The wonderful skill shown by the Egyptians in
embalming and technical works is sufficient to render it fairly certain
that their chemical knowledge was considerable; and the frequent operations
of one caste upon the dead must have laid the foundations of a
pathological and anatomical culture, of which only traces remain.</p>

<p>The Egyptians knew prussic acid as extracted in a dilute state from
certain plants, among the chief of which was certainly the peach; on a
papyrus preserved at the Louvre, M. Duteil read, &#8220;Pronounce not the
name of I. A. O. under the penalty of the peach!&#8221; in which dark threat,
without doubt, lurks the meaning that those who revealed the religious
mysteries of the priests were put to death by waters distilled from the
peach. That the priests actually distilled the peach-leaves has been
doubted by those who consider the art of distillation a modern invention;
but this process was well known to adepts of the third and fourth centuries,
and there is no inherent improbability in the supposition that the
Egyptians practised it.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_3" id="Sect_3"></a>&sect; 3. From the Egyptians the knowledge of the deadly drink appears to
have passed to the Romans. At the trial of Antipater,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Verus brought
a potion derived from Egypt, which had been intended to destroy Herod;
this was essayed on a criminal, he died at once. In the reign of Tiberius,
a Roman knight, accused of high treason, swallowed a poison, and fell
dead at the feet of the senators: in both cases the rapidity of action
appears to point to prussic acid.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>The use of poison by the Greeks, as a means of capital punishment,
without doubt favoured suicide by the same means; the easy, painless
death of the state prisoner would be often preferred to the sword by one
tired of life. The ancients looked indeed upon suicide, in certain instances,
as something noble, and it was occasionally formally sanctioned. Thus,
Valerius Maximus tells us that he saw a woman of quality, in the island
of Ceos, who, having lived happily for ninety years, obtained leave to take
a poisonous draught, lest, by living longer, she should happen to have a
change in her good fortune; and, curiously enough, this sanctioning of
self-destruction seems to have been copied in Europe. Mead relates that
the people of Marseilles of old had a poison, kept by the public authorities,
in which cicuta was an ingredient: a dose was allowed to any one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
who could show why he should desire death. Whatever use or abuse
might be made of a few violent poisons, Greek and Roman knowledge
of poisons, their effects and methods of detection, was stationary, primitive,
and incomplete.</p>

<p><i>Nicander of Colophon</i> (204-138 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) wrote two treatises, the most
ancient works on this subject extant, the one describing the effects of snake
venom; the other, the properties of opium, henbane, certain fungi,
colchicum, aconite, and conium. He divided poisons into those which
kill quickly, and those which act slowly. As antidotes, those medicines
are recommended which excite vomiting&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, lukewarm oil, warm water,
mallow, linseed tea, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Apollodorus</i> lived at the commencement of the third century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>:
he wrote a work on poisonous animals, and one on deleterious medicines;
these works of Apollodorus were the sources from which Pliny, Heraclitus,
and several of the later writers derived most of their knowledge of poisons.</p>

<p><i>Dioscorides</i> (40-90 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>) well detailed the effects of cantharides, sulphate
of copper, mercury, lead, and arsenic. By arsenic he would appear
sometimes to mean the sulphides, sometimes the white oxide. Dioscorides
divided poisons, according to their origin, into three classes, viz.:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. <b>Animal Poisons.</b>&mdash;Under this head were classed cantharides and
allied beetles, toads, salamanders, poisonous snakes, a particular variety
of honey, and the blood of the ox, probably the latter in a putrid state.
He also speaks of the &#8220;<i>sea-hare</i>.&#8221; The sea-hare was considered by the
ancients very poisonous, and Domitian is said to have murdered Titus
with it. It is supposed by naturalists to have been one of the genus
<i>Aplysia</i>, among the <i>gasteropods</i>. Both Pliny and Dioscorides depict the
animal as something very formidable: it was not to be looked at, far less
touched. The aplysi&aelig; exhale a very nauseous and f&#339;tid odour when
they are approached: the best known of the species resembles, when in
a state of repose, a mass of unformed flesh; when in motion, it is like a
common slug; its colour is reddish-brown; it has four horns on its head;
and the eyes, which are very small, are situated between the two hinder
ones. This aplysia has an ink reservoir, like the sepia, and ejects it in
order to escape from its enemies; it inhabits the muddy bottom of the
water, and lives on small crabs, mollusca, &amp;c.</p>

<p>2. <b>Poisons from Plants.</b>&mdash;Dioscorides enumerates opium, black and
white hyoscyamus (especially recognising the activity of the seeds), mandragora,
which was probably a mixture of various solanace&aelig;, conium (used
to poison the condemned by the people of Athens and the dwellers of
ancient Massilia), elaterin, and the juices of a species of euphorbia and
apocyne&aelig;. He also makes a special mention of aconite, the name of
which is derived from <i>Akon</i>, a small city in Heraclea. The Greeks were
well aware of the deadly nature of aconite, and gave to it a mythical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
origin, from the foam of the dog Cerberus. Colchicum was also known
to Dioscorides: its first use was ascribed to Medea. Veratrum album
and nigrum were famous medicines of the Romans, and a constituent of
their &#8220;<i>rat and mice powders</i>;&#8221; they were also used as insecticides.
According to Pliny, the Gauls dipped their arrows in a preparation of
veratrum.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Daphne mezereon, called by the Romans also smilax and
taxus, appears to have been used by Cativolcus, the king of the Eburones,
for the purpose of suicide, or possibly by &#8220;taxus&#8221; the yew-tree is meant.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The poisonous properties of certain fungi were also known. Nicander
calls the venomous mushrooms the &#8220;evil fermentation of the earth,&#8221; and
prescribes the identical antidotes which we would perhaps give at the
present time&mdash;viz., vinegar and alkaline carbonates.</p>

<p>3. <b>Mineral Poisons.</b>&mdash;Arsenic has been already alluded to. The
ancients used it as a caustic and depilatory. Copper was known as sulphate
and oxide; mercury only as cinnabar: lead oxides were used, and milk
and olive-oil prescribed as an antidote for their poisonous properties. The
<i>poison-lehre</i> for many ages was considered as something forbidden. Galen,
in his treatise &#8220;On Antidotes,&#8221; remarks that the only authors who dared
to treat of poisons were Orpheus, Theologus, Morus, Mendesius the
younger, Heliodorus of Athens, Aratus, and a few others; but none of
these treatises have come down to us. From the close similarity of the
amount of information in the treatises of Nicander, Dioscorides, Pliny,
Galen, and Paulus &AElig;gineta, it is probable that all were derived from a
common source.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_4" id="Sect_4"></a>&sect; 4. If we turn our attention to early Asiatic history, a very cursory
glance at the sacred writings of the East will prove how soon the art of
poisoning, especially in India, was used for the purpose of suicide, revenge,
or robbery.</p>

<p>The ancient practice of the Hindoo widow&mdash;self-immolation on the burning
pile of her husband&mdash;is ascribed to the necessity which the Brahmins
were under of putting a stop to the crime of domestic poisoning. Every
little conjugal quarrel was liable to be settled by this form of secret
assassination, but such a law, as might be expected, checked the practice.</p>

<p>Poison was not used to remove human beings alone, for there has been
from time immemorial in India much cattle-poisoning. In the Institutes
of Menu, it is ordained that when cattle die the herdsman shall carry to
his master their ears, their hides, their tails, the skin below their navels,
their tendons, and the liquor oozing from their foreheads. Without doubt
these regulations were directed against cattle-poisoners.</p>

<p>The poisons known to the Asiatics were arsenic, aconite, opium, and
various solanaceous plants. There has been a myth floating through the
ages that a poison exists which will slay a long time after its introduction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
All modern authors have treated the matter as an exaggerated
legend, but, for my own part, I see no reason why it should not, in reality,
be founded on fact. There is little doubt that the Asiatic poisoners were
well acquainted with the infectious qualities of certain fevers and malignant
diseases. Now, these very malignant diseases answer precisely to
the description of a poison which has no immediate effects. Plant small-pox
in the body of a man, and for a whole fortnight he walks about, well
and hearty. Clothe a person with a garment soaked in typhus, and the
same thing occurs&mdash;for many days there will be no sign of failure. Again,
the gipsies, speaking a tongue which is essentially a deformed <i>prakrit</i>,
and therefore Indian in origin, have long possessed a knowledge of the
properties of the curious &#8220;<i>mucor phycomyces</i>.&#8221; This was considered an
alga by Agaron, but Berkeley referred it to the fungi. The gipsies are
said to have administered the spores of this fungi in warm water. In
this way they rapidly attach themselves to the mucous membrane of
the throat, all the symptoms of a phthisis follow, and death takes place
in from two to three weeks. Mr Berkeley informed me that he has seen
specimens growing on broth which had been rejected from the stomach,
and that it develops in enormous quantities on oil-casks and walls
impregnated with grease. The filaments are long, from 12 to 18 inches,
and it is capable of very rapid development.</p>

<p>There is also a modern poison, which, in certain doses, dooms the
unfortunate individual to a terrible malady, simulating, to a considerable
extent, natural disease,&mdash;that is phosphorus. This poison was, however,
unknown until some time in the eleventh century, when Alchid Becher,
blindly experimenting on the distillation of urine and carbon, obtained
his &#8220;<i>escarboucle</i>,&#8221; and passed away without knowing the importance of
his discovery, which, like so many others, had to be rediscovered at a
later period.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_5" id="Sect_5"></a>&sect; 5. The Hebrews were acquainted with certain poisons, the exact
nature of which is not quite clear. The words &#8220;<i>rosch</i>&#8221; and &#8220;<i>chema</i>&#8221;
seem to be used occasionally as a generic term for poison, and sometimes
to mean a specific thing; &#8220;<i>rosch</i>,&#8221; especially, is used to signify some
poisonous parasitic plant. They knew yellow arsenic under the name of
&#8220;<i>sam</i>,&#8221; aconite under the name of &#8220;<i>boschka</i>,&#8221; and possibly &#8220;<i>son</i>&#8221; means
<i>ergot</i>.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In the later period of their history, when they were dispersed
through various nations, they would naturally acquire the knowledge of
those nations, without losing their own.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_6" id="Sect_6"></a>&sect; 6. The part that poison has played in history is considerable. The
pharmaceutical knowledge of the ancients is more graphically and terribly
shown in the deaths of Socrates, Demosthenes, Hannibal, and Cleopatra,
than in the pages of the older writers on poisons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>In the reign of Artaxerxes II. (Memnon), (<span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> 405-359), Phrysa
poisoned the queen Statira by cutting food with a knife poisoned on one
side only. Although this has been treated as an idle tale, yet two
poisons, aconite and arsenic, were at least well known; either of these
could have been in the way mentioned introduced in sufficient quantity
into food to destroy life.</p>

<p>In the early part of the Christian era professional poisoners arose, and
for a long time exercised their trade with impunity. Poisoning was so
much in use as a political engine that Agrippina (<span class="smcapall">A.D.</span> 26) refused to eat
of some apples offered to her at table by her father-in-law, Tiberius.</p>

<p>It was at this time that the infamous Locusta flourished. She is said
to have supplied, with suitable directions, the poison by which Agrippina
got rid of Claudius; and the same woman was the principal agent in the
preparation of the poison that was administered to Britannicus, by order
of his brother Nero. The details of this interesting case have been
recorded with some minuteness.</p>

<p>It was the custom of the Romans to drink hot water, a draught
nauseous enough to us, but, from fashion or habit, considered by them a
luxury; and, as no two men&#8217;s tastes are alike, great skill was shown by
the slaves in bringing the water to exactly that degree of heat which
their respective masters found agreeable.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<hr class="footnote" />

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>The children of the Imperial house, with others of the great Roman
families, sat at the banquets at a smaller side table, while their parents
reclined at the larger. A slave brings hot water to Britannicus; it is too
hot; Britannicus refuses it. The slave adds cold water; and it is this
cold water that is supposed to have been poisoned; in any case,
Britannicus had no sooner drunk of it than he lost voice and respiration.
Agrippina, his mother, was struck with terror, as well as Octavia, his
sister. Nero, the author of the crime, looks coldly on, saying that such
fits often happened to him in infancy without evil result; and after a
few moments&#8217; silence the banquet goes on as before. If this were not
sudden death from heart or brain disease, the poison must have been
either a cyanide or prussic acid.</p>

<p>In those times no autopsy was possible: although the Alexandrian
school, some 300 years before Christ, had dissected both the living and
the dead, the work of Herophilus and Erasistratus had not been pursued,
and the great Roman and Greek writers knew only the rudiments of
human anatomy, while, as to pathological changes and their true interpretation,
their knowledge may be said to have been absolutely <i>nil</i>. It
was not, indeed, until the fifteenth century that the Popes, silencing
ancient scruples, authorised dissections; and it was not until the
sixteenth century that Vesalius, the first worthy of being considered a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
great anatomist, arose. In default of pathological knowledge, the
ancients attached great importance to mere outward marks and discolorations.
They noted with special attention spots and lividity, and supposed
that poisons singled out the heart for some quite peculiar action, altering
its substance in such a manner that it resisted the action of the funeral
pyre, and remained unconsumed. It may, then, fairly be presumed that
many people must have died from poison without suspicion, and still
more from the sudden effects of latent disease, ascribed wrongfully to
poison. For example, the death of Alexander was generally at that time
ascribed to poison; but Littr&eacute; has fairly proved that the great emperor,
debilitated by his drinking habits, caught a malarious fever in the
marshes around Babylon, and died after eleven days&#8217; illness. If, added
to sudden death, the body, from any cause, entered into rapid putrefaction,
such signs were considered by the people absolutely conclusive of
poisoning: this belief, indeed, prevailed up to the middle of the
seventeenth century, and lingers still among the uneducated at the
present day. Thus, when Britannicus died, an extraordinary lividity
spread over the face of the corpse, which they attempted to conceal by
painting the face. When Pope Alexander VI. died, probably enough
from poison, his body (according to Guicciardini) became a frightful
spectacle&mdash;it was livid, bloated, and deformed; the gorged tongue
entirely filled the mouth; from the nose flowed putrid pus, and the
stench was horrible in the extreme.</p>

<p>All these effects of decomposition, we know, are apt to arise in coarse,
obese bodies, and accompany both natural and unnatural deaths; indeed,
if we look strictly at the matter, putting on one side the preservative
effects of certain metallic poisons, it may be laid down that generally the
corpses of those dying from poison are <i>less</i> apt to decompose rapidly than
those dying from disease&mdash;this for the simple reason that a majority of
diseases cause changes in the fluids and tissues, which render putrefactive
changes more active, while, as a rule, those who take poison are suddenly
killed, with their fluids and tissues fairly healthy.</p>

<p>When the Duke of Burgundy desired to raise a report that John,
Dauphin of France, was poisoned (1457), he described the imaginary
event as follows:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;One evening our most redoubtable lord and nephew fell so grievously
sick that he died forthwith. His lips, tongue, and face were swollen;
his eyes started out of his head. It was a horrible sight to see&mdash;for so
look people that are poisoned.&#8221;</p>

<p>The favourite powder of the professional poisoner, arsenic, was known
to crowned heads in the fourteenth century; and there has come down
to us a curious document, drawn out by Charles le Mauvais, King of
Navarre. It is a commission of murder, given to a certain Woudreton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
to poison Charles VI., the Duke of Valois, brother of the king, and his
uncles, the Dukes of Berry, Burgundy, and Bourbon:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Go thou to Paris; thou canst do great service if thou wilt: do what
I tell thee; I will reward thee well. Thou shalt do thus: There is a
thing which is called sublimed arsenic; if a man eat a bit the size of a
pea he will never survive. Thou wilt find it in Pampeluna, Bordeaux,
Bayonne, and in all the good towns through which thou wilt pass, at
the apothecaries&#8217; shops. Take it and powder it; and when thou shalt
be in the house of the king, of the Count de Valois, his brother, the
Dukes of Berry, Burgundy, and Bourbon, draw near, and betake thyself
to the kitchen, to the larder, to the cellar, or any other place where thy
point can be best gained, and put the powder in the soups, meats, or
wines, provided that thou canst do it secretly. Otherwise, do it not.&#8221;
Woudreton was detected, and executed in 1384.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

by &#8220;a poisoned egg.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the reign of King John, the White Tower received one of the first
and fairest of a long line of female victims in that Maud Fitzwalter who
was known to the singers of her time as Maud the Fair. The father of
this beautiful girl was Robert, Lord Fitzwalter, of Castle Baynard, on
the Thames, one of John&#8217;s greatest barons. Yet the king, during a fit of
violence with the queen, fell madly in love with this young girl. As
neither the lady herself nor her powerful sire would listen to his
disgraceful suit, the king is said to have seized her by force at
Dunmow, and brought her to the Tower. Fitzwalter raised an outcry, on
which the king sent troops into Castle Baynard and his other houses; and
when the baron protested against these wrongs, his master banished him
from the realm. Fitzwalter fled to France with his wife and his other
children, leaving his daughter Maud in the Tower, where she suffered a
daily insult in the king&#8217;s unlawful suit. On her proud and scornful
answer to his passion being heard, John carried her up to the roof, and
locked her in the round turret, standing on the north-east angle of the
keep. Maud&#8217;s cage was the highest, chilliest den in the Tower; but
neither cold, nor solitude, nor hunger could break her strength. In the
rage of his disappointed love, the king sent one of his minions to her
room with a poisoned egg, of which the brave girl ate and died.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Her

<p><a name="Sect_7" id="Sect_7"></a>&sect; 7. Two great criminal schools arose from the fifteenth to the
seventeenth centuries in Venice and Italy. The Venetian poisoners are
of earlier date than the Italian, and flourished chiefly in the fifteenth
century. Here we have the strange spectacle, not of the depravity of
individuals, but of the government of the State formally recognising
secret assassination by poison, and proposals to remove this or that
prince, duke, or emperor, as a routine part of their deliberations. Still
more curious and unique, the dark communings of &#8220;<i>the council of ten</i>&#8221;
were recorded in writing, and the number of those who voted for and
who voted against the proposed crime, the reason for the assassination,
and the sum to be paid, still exist in shameless black and white. Those
who desire to study this branch of secret history may be referred to a
small work by Carl Hoff, which gives a brief account of what is known
of the proceedings of the council. One example will here suffice. On
the 15th of December 1513 a Franciscan brother, John of Ragubo,
offered a selection of poisons, and declared himself ready to remove any
objectionable person out of the way. For the first successful case he
required a pension of 1500 ducats yearly, which was to be increased on
the execution of future services. The presidents, Girolando Duoda and
Pietro Guiarina, placed the matter before the &#8220;ten&#8221; on the 4th of
January 1514, and on a division (10 against 5) it was resolved to accept
so patriotic an offer, and to experiment first on the Emperor Maximilian.
The bond laid before the &#8220;ten&#8221; contained a regular tariff&mdash;for the great
Sultan 500 ducats, for the King of Spain 150 ducats, but the journey
and other expenses were in each case to be defrayed; the Duke of Milan
was rated at 60, the Marquis of Mantua at 50, the Pope could be removed
at 100 ducats. The curious offer thus concludes:&mdash;&#8220;The farther the
journey, the more eminent the man, the more it is necessary to reward
the toil and hardships undertaken, and the heavier must be the payment.&#8221;
The council appear to have quietly arranged thus to take away
the lives of many public men, but their efforts were only in a few cases
successful. When the deed was done, it was registered by a single
marginal note, &#8220;<i>factum</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>What drugs the Venetian poisoners used is uncertain. The Italians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
became notorious in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries for their
knowledge of poisons, partly from the deeds of Toffana and others, and
partly from the works of J. Baptista Porta, who wrote a very comprehensive
treatise, under the title of <i>Natural Magic</i>,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and managed to slide
into the text, in the sections on cooking (<i>De Re Coquinaria</i>, lib. xiv.), a
mass of knowledge as to the preparation of poisons. There are prescriptions
that little accord with the title, unless indeed the trades of cook
and poisoner were the same. He gives a method of drugging wine with
belladonna root, for the purpose of making the loaded guest loathe drink;
he also gives a list of solanaceous plants, and makes special mention of
nux vomica, aconite, veratrum, and mezereon. Again, in the section (<i>De
Ancupio</i>, lib. xv.) he gives a recipe for a very strong poison which he calls
&#8220;<i>venenum lupinum</i>;&#8221; it is to be made of the powdered leaves of <i>Aconitum
lycoctonum</i>, <i>Taxus baccata</i>, powdered glass, caustic lime, sulphide
of arsenic, and bitter almonds, the whole to be mixed with honey, and
made into pills the size of a hazel-nut.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>In the section <i>De Medicis Experimentis</i> he gives a process to poison
a sleeping person: the recipe is curious, and would certainly not have
the intended effect. A mixture of hemlock juice, bruised datura,
stramonium, belladonna, and opium is placed in a leaden box with a
perfectly fitting cover, and fermented for several days; it is then opened
under the nose of the sleeper. Possibly Porta had experimented on
small animals, and had found that such matters, when fermented, exhaled
enough carbonic acid gas to kill them, and imagined, therefore, that the
same thing would happen if applied to the human subject. However
this may be, the account which Porta gives of the effects of the solanaceous
plants, and the general tone of the work, amply prove that he
was no theorist, but had studied practically the actions of poisons.</p>

<p>The iniquitous Toffana (or Tophana) made solutions of arsenious acid
of varying strength, and sold these solutions in phials under the name of
&#8220;<i>Acquetta di Napoli</i>&#8221; for many years. She is supposed to have poisoned
more than 600 persons, among whom were two Popes&mdash;viz., Pius III.
and Clement XIV. The composition of the Naples water was long a
profound secret, but is said to have been known by the reigning Pope
and by the Emperor Charles VI. The latter told the secret to Dr
Garelli, his physician, who, again, imparted the knowledge to the famous
Friedrich Hoffman in a letter still extant. Toffana was brought to justice
in 1709, but, availing herself of the immunity afforded by convents,
escaped punishment, and continued to sell her wares for twenty years
afterwards. When Kepfer<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> was in Italy he found her in a prison at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Naples, and many people visited her, as a sort of lion (1730). With the
<i>Acqua Toffana</i>, the &#8220;<i>Acquetta di Perugia</i>&#8221; played at the same time its
part. It is said to have been prepared by killing a hog, disjointing the
same, strewing the pieces with white arsenic, which was well rubbed in,
and then collecting the juice which dropped from the meat; this juice
was considered far more poisonous than an ordinary solution of arsenic.
The researches of Selmi on compounds containing arsenic, produced when
animal bodies decompose in arsenical fluids, lend reason and support to
this view; and probably the juice would not only be very poisonous, but
act in a different manner, and exhibit symptoms different from those of
ordinary arsenical poisoning. Toffana had disciples; she taught the art
to Hieronyma Spara, who formed an association of young married women
during the popedom of Alexander VII.; these were detected on their
own confession.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Contemporaneously with Toffana, another Italian, Keli, devoted himself
to similar crimes. This man had expended much as an adept
searching for the philosopher&#8217;s stone, and sought to indemnify himself
by entering upon what must have been a profitable business. He it was
who instructed M. de St. Croix in the properties of arsenic; and St.
Croix, in his turn, imparted the secret to his paramour, Madame de
Brinvilliers. This woman appears to have been as cold-blooded as

invented &#8220;les poudres de succession.&#8221; She poisoned her father,
brothers, sister, and others of her family; but a terrible fate overtook
both her and St. Croix. The latter was suffocated by some poisonous
matters he was preparing, and Madame de Brinvilliers&#8217; practices
having become known, she was obliged to take refuge in a convent.
Here she was courted by a police officer disguised as an abb&eacute;, lured
out of the convent, and, in this way brought to justice, was beheaded<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>

Victor Hugo, describing the rack in that prison, says, &#8220;The Marchioness
de Brinvilliers was stretched upon it stark naked, fastened down, so to
speak, quartered by four chains attached to the four limbs, and there
suffered the frightful extraordinary torture by water,&#8221; which caused her

in this little body?&#8221;&mdash;<i>Things seen by Victor Hugo</i>, vol. i.</p>

<p>The water torture was this:&mdash;a huge funnel-like vessel was fitted on to
the neck, the edge of the funnel coming up to the eyes; on now pouring
water into the funnel so that the fluid rises above the nose and mouth,
the poor wretch is bound to swallow the fluid or die of suffocation; if
indeed the sufferer resolve to be choked, in the first few moments of
unconsciousness the fluid is swallowed automatically, and air again
admitted to the lungs; it is therefore obvious that in this way
prodigious quantities of fluid might be taken.</p>

<p>The numerous attempts of the Italian and Venetian poisoners on the
lives of monarchs and eminent persons cast for a long time a cloud over
regal domestic peace. Bullets and daggers were not feared, but in their
place the dish of meat, the savoury pasty, and the red wine were regarded
as possible carriers of death. No better example of this dread
can be found than, at so late a period as the reign of Henry VII.,<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> the

court that Anne Boleyn attempted to dose him. &#8220;The king, in an interview

<p>However brief and imperfect the foregoing historical sketch of the
part that poison has played may be, it is useful in showing the absolute
necessity of a toxicological science&mdash;a science embracing many branches
of knowledge. If it is impossible now for Toffanas, Locustas, and other
specimens of a depraved humanity to carry on their crimes without
detection; if poison is the very last form of death feared by eminent
political persons; it is not so much owing to a different state of society,
as to the more exact scientific knowledge which is applied during life to
the discrimination of symptoms, distinguishing between those resulting
from disease and those due to injurious substances, and after death to a
highly developed pathology, which has learned, by multiplied observations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
all the normal and abnormal signs in tissues and organs; and,
finally, to an ever-advancing chemistry, which is able in many instances
to separate and detect the hurtful and noxious thing, although hid for
months deep in the ground.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h3>II.&mdash;Growth and Development of the Modern Methods of
Chemically Detecting Poisons.</h3>

<p><a name="Sect_8" id="Sect_8"></a>&sect; 8. The history of the detection of poisons has gone through several
phases. The first phase has already been incidentally touched upon&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
detection by antecedent and surrounding circumstances, aided sometimes
by experiments on animals. If the death was sudden, if the post-mortem
decomposition was rapid, poison was indicated: sometimes a
portion of the food last eaten, or the suspected thing, would be given
to an animal; if the animal also died, such accumulation of proof would
render the matter beyond doubt. The modern toxicologists are more
sceptical, for even the last test is not of itself satisfactory. It is now
known that meat may become filled with bacilli and produce rapid death,
and yet no poison, as such, has been added.</p>

<p>In the next phase, the doctors were permitted to dissect, and to
familiarise themselves with pathological appearances. This was a great
step gained: the apoplexies, heart diseases, perforations of the stomach,
and fatal internal h&aelig;morrhages could no longer be ascribed to poison.
If popular clamour made a false accusation, there was more chance of a
correct judgment. It was not until the end of the eighteenth and the
beginning of the present century, however, that chemistry was far
enough advanced to test for the more common mineral poisons; the
modern phase was then entered on, and toxicology took a new departure.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_9" id="Sect_9"></a>&sect; 9. From the treatise of Barth&eacute;l&eacute;my d&#8217;Anglais<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> in the thirteenth
century (in which he noticed the poisonous properties of quicksilver
vapour), up to the end of the fifteenth century, there are numerous
treatises upon poison, most of which are mere learned compilations, and
scarcely repay perusal. In the sixteenth century, there are a few works,
such, for example, as Porta, which partook of the general advancement of
science, and left behind the stereotyped doctrine of the old classical
schools.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>In the seventeenth century the Honourable Robert Boyle made some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
shrewd observations, bearing on toxicology, in his work on &#8220;The usefulness
of Natural Philosophy,&#8221; &amp;c.: Oxford, 1664. Nicolas L&#8217;Emery also
wrote a <i>Cours de Chimie</i>,&mdash;quite an epitome of the chemical science of
the time.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>In the eighteenth century still further advances were made. Richard
Mead published his ingenious <i>Mechanical Theory of Poisons</i>. Great
chemists arose&mdash;Stahl, Marggraf, Brandt, Bergmann, Scheele, Berthollet,
Priestley, and lastly, Lavoisier&mdash;and chemistry, as a science, was born. Of
the chemists quoted, Scheele, in relation to toxicology, stands chief. It
was Scheele who discovered prussic acid,<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> without, however, noting its
poisonous properties; the same chemist separated oxalic acid from sorrel,<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
and made the important discovery that arsenic united with hydrogen,
forming a f&#339;tid gas, and, moreover, that this gas could be decomposed
by heat.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> From this observation, a delicate test for arsenic was afterwards
elaborated, which for the first time rendered the most tasteless
and easily administered poison in the whole world at once the easiest of
detection. The further history of what is now called &#8220;Marsh&#8217;s Test&#8221;
is as follows:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

when arsenical tin was dissolved in hydrochloric acid, and that arsenic
was deposited from the inflamed gas on cold surfaces which the flame
touched. Trommsdorff next announced, in 1803, that when arsenical zinc
was introduced into an ordinary flask with water and sulphuric acid, an
arsenical hydrogen was disengaged; and if the tube was sufficiently long,
arsenic was deposited on its walls.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Stromeyer, Gay-Lussac, Th&eacute;nard,
Gehlen, and Davy later studied this gas, and Serullas in 1821 proposed
this reaction as a toxicological test. Lastly, in 1836, Marsh published
his Memoir.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> He elaborated a special apparatus of great simplicity,
developed hydrogen by means of zinc and sulphuric acid, inflamed the
issuing gas, and obtained any arsenic present as a metal, which could be
afterwards converted into arsenious acid, &amp;c.</p>

<p>This brief history of the so-called &#8220;Marsh&#8217;s Test&#8221; amply shows that
Marsh was not the discoverer of the test. Like many other useful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
processes, it seems to have been evolved by a combination of many minds.
It may, however, be truly said that Marsh was the first who perfected
the test and brought it prominently forward.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_11" id="Sect_11"></a>&sect; 11. Matthieu Joseph Bonaventura Orfila must be considered the
father of modern toxicology. His great work, <i>Trait&eacute; de Toxicologie</i>, was
first published in 1814, and went through many editions. Orfila&#8217;s chief
merit was the discovery that poisons were absorbed and accumulated in
certain tissues&mdash;a discovery which bore immediate fruit, and greatly extended
the means of seeking poisons. Before the time of Orfila, a chemist
not finding anything in the stomach would not have troubled to examine
the liver, the kidney, the brain, or the blood. The immense number of
experiments which Orfila undertook is simply marvellous. Some are of
little value, and teach nothing accurately as to the action of poisons&mdash;as,
for example, many of those in which he tied the gullet in order to prevent
vomiting, for such are experiments under entirely unnatural conditions;
but there are still a large number which form the very basis of our
pathological knowledge.</p>

<p>Orfila&#8217;s method of experiment was usually to take weighed or measured
quantities of poison, to administer them to animals, and then after death&mdash;first
carefully noting the changes in the tissues and organs&mdash;to attempt
to recover by chemical means the poison administered. In this way he
detected and recovered nearly all the organic and inorganic poisons then
known; and most of his processes are, with modifications and improvements,
in use at the present time.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p><a name="Sect_12" id="Sect_12"></a>&sect; 12. The discovery of the alkaloids at the commencement of this
century certainly gave the poisoner new weapons; yet the same processes
(slightly modified) which separated the alkaloids from plants also
served to separate them from the human body. In 1803 Derosne discovered
narcotine and morphine, but he neither recognised the difference
between these two substances, nor their basic properties. Sert&uuml;rner from
1805 devoted himself to the study of opium, and made a series of discoveries.
Robiquet, in 1807, recognised the basic characters of narcotine.
In 1818 Pelletier and Caventou separated strychnine; in 1819 brucine;
and in the same year delphinine was discovered simultaneously by Brande,
Lassaigne, and Feneuille. Coniine was recognised by Giesecke in 1827,
and in the following year, 1828, nicotine was separated by Reimann and
Posselt. In 1832 Robiquet discovered codeine; and in 1833 atropine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
aconitine, and hyoscyamine were distinguished by Geiger and Hesse.
Since then, every year has been marked by the separation of some new
alkaloid, from either animal or vegetable substances. So many workers
in different countries now began to study and improve toxicology, that it
would exceed the limits and be foreign to the scope of this treatise to
give even a brief <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of their labours. It may, notwithstanding, be
useful to append a short bibliography of the chief works on toxicology of
the present century.</p>

<h2>PART II.</h2>

<h3>I.&mdash;Definition of Poison.</h3>

<p><a name="Sect_14" id="Sect_14"></a>&sect; 14. The term &#8220;<i>Poison</i>&#8221; may be considered first in its legal, as distinct
from its scientific, aspect.</p>

<p><i>The legal definition</i> of &#8220;poison&#8221; is to be gathered from the various
statute-books of civilised nations.</p>

<p>The English law enacts that: &#8220;Whoever shall administer, or cause to
be administered to, or taken by any person, any poison or other destructive
thing, with intent to commit murder, shall be guilty of felony.&#8221;</p>

<p>Further, by the Criminal Consolidation Act, 1861: &#8220;Whosoever shall,
by any other means other than those specified in any of the preceding
sections of this Act, attempt to commit murder, shall be guilty of
felony.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is therefore evident that, by implication, the English law defines a
poison to be a destructive thing administered to, or taken by, a person,
and it must necessarily include, not only poisons which act on account of
their inherent chemical and other properties after absorption into the
blood, but mechanical irritants, and also specifically-tainted fluids.
Should, for example, a person give to another milk, or other fluid, knowing,
at the same time, that such fluid is contaminated by the specific
poison of scarlet fever, typhoid, or any serious malady capable of being
thus conveyed, I believe that such an offence could be brought under the
first of the sections quoted. In fine, the words &#8220;<i>destructive thing</i>&#8221; are
widely applicable, and may be extended to any substance, gaseous,
liquid, or solid, living or dead, which, if capable at all of being taken
within the body, may injure or destroy life. According to this view, the
legal idea of &#8220;poison&#8221; would include such matters as boiling water,
molten lead, specifically-infected fluids, the flesh of animals dying of
diseases which may be communicable to man, powdered glass, diamond
dust, &amp;c. Evidence must, however, be given of guilty intent.</p>

<p>The words, &#8220;administered to or taken by,&#8221; imply obviously that the
framers of the older statute considered the mouth as the only portal of
entrance for criminal poisoning, but the present law effectually guards
against any attempt to commit murder, no matter by what means.
There is thus ample provision for all the strange ways by which poison
has been introduced into the system, whether it be by the ear, nose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
brain, rectum, vagina, or any other conceivable way, so that, to borrow
the words of Mr. Greaves (<i>Notes on Criminal Law Consolidation</i>), &#8220;the
malicious may rest satisfied that every attempt to murder which their
perverted ingenuity may devise, or their fiendish malignity suggest,
will fall within some clause of this Act, and may be visited with penal
servitude for life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Since poison is often exhibited, not for the purpose of taking life, but
from various motives, and to accomplish various ends&mdash;as, for example,
to narcotise the robber&#8217;s victim (this especially in the East), to quiet
children, to create love in the opposite sex (love philters), to detect the
secret sipper by suitably preparing the wine, to expel the inconvenient
fruit of illicit affection, to cure inebriety by polluting the drunkard&#8217;s
drink with antimony, and, finally, to satisfy an aimless spirit of mere
wantonness and wickedness, the English law enacts &#8220;that whosoever shall
unlawfully or maliciously administer to, or cause to be taken by, any
other person, any poison or other destructive or noxious thing, so as
thereby to endanger the life of such person, or so as thereby to inflict
upon such person any grievous bodily harm, shall be guilty of felony.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is also a special provision, framed, evidently, with reference to
volatile and stupefying poisons, such as chloroform, tetrachloride of
carbon, &amp;c.:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Whoever shall unlawfully apply, or administer to, or cause to be
taken by any person, any chloroform, laudanum, or other stupefying or
overpowering drug, matter, or thing, with intent, in any such case,
thereby to enable himself or any other person to commit, or with intent,
&amp;c., to assist any other person in committing, any indictable offence,
shall be guilty of felony.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="Sect_15" id="Sect_15"></a>&sect; 15. The German statute, as with successive amendments it now
stands, enacts as follows:<span class="nowrap"><a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>&mdash;</span></p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<div class="footnote">

<p>&#8220;Ist durch die Handlung eine schwere K&ouml;rperverletzung verursacht worden,
so ist auf Zuchthaus nicht unter f&uuml;nf Jahren, und wenn durch die
Handlung der Tod verursacht worden, auf Zuchthaus nicht unter zehn
Jahren oder auf lebensl&auml;ngliches Zuchthaus zu erkennen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ist die vors&auml;tzliche rechtswidrige Handlung des Gift&mdash;&amp;c.,&mdash;Beibringens

vors&auml;tzlich einen Menschen t&ouml;dtet, wird, wenn er die T&ouml;dtung mit

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>&#8220;Whoever wilfully administers (<i>beibringt</i>) to a person, for the purpose
of injuring health, poison, or any other substance having the property
of injuring health, will be punished by from two to ten years&#8217; imprisonment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;If by such act a serious bodily injury is caused, the imprisonment is
not to be less than five years; if death is the result, the imprisonment
is to be not under ten years or for life.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the death is wilfully caused by poison, it comes under the general
law: &#8216;Whoever wilfully kills a man, and if the killing is premeditated,
is on account of murder punishable with death.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The French law runs thus (Art. 301, <i>Penal Code</i>):&mdash;&#8220;Every attempt
on the life of a person, by the effect of substances which may cause
death, more or less suddenly, in whatever manner these substances may
have been employed or administered, and whatever may have been the
results, is called poisoning.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p><a name="Sect_16" id="Sect_16"></a>&sect; 16. <b>Scientific Definition of a Poison.</b>&mdash;A true scientific definition of
a poison must exclude all those substances which act mechanically,&mdash;the
physical influences of heat, light, and electricity; and parasitic diseases,
whether caused by the growth of fungus, or the invasion of an organism
by animal parasites, as, for example, &#8220;trichinosis,&#8221; which are not, so far
as we know, associated with any poisonous product excreted by the
parasite;&mdash;on the other hand, it is now recognised that pathogenic micro-organisms
develop poisons, and the symptoms of all true infections are
but the effects of &#8220;toxines.&#8221; The definition of poison, in a scientific
sense, should be broad enough to comprehend not only the human race,
but the dual world of life, both animal and vegetable.</p>

<p>Husemann and Kobert are almost the only writers on poisons who
have attempted, with more or less success, to define poison by a
generalisation, keeping in view the exclusion of the matters enumerated.
Husemann says&mdash;&#8220;We define poisons as such inorganic, or organic
substances as are in part capable of artificial preparation, in part existing,
ready-formed, in the animal or vegetable kingdom, which, without being
able to reproduce themselves, through the chemical nature of their
molecules under certain conditions, change in the healthy organism the
form and general relationship of the organic parts, and, through annihilation
of organs, or destruction of their functions, injure health, or, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
certain conditions, destroy life.&#8221; Kobert says:&mdash;&#8220;Poisons are organic or
inorganic unorganised substances originating in the organism itself, or
introduced into the organism, either artificially prepared, or ready formed
in nature, which through their chemical properties, under certain conditions,
so influence the organs of living beings, that the health of these
beings is seriously influenced temporarily or permanently.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the first edition of this work I made an attempt to define a poison
thus:&mdash;<i>A substance of definite chemical composition, whether mineral or
organic, may be called a poison, if it is capable of being taken into any
living organism, and causes, by its own inherent chemical nature, impairment
or destruction of function</i>. I prefer this definition to Kobert&#8217;s, and
believe that it fairly agrees with what we know of poisons.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h3>II.&mdash;Classification of Poisons.</h3>

<p><a name="Sect_17" id="Sect_17"></a>&sect; 17. At some future time, with a more intimate knowledge of the
way in which each poison acts upon the various forms of animal and
vegetable life, it may be possible to give a truly scientific and philosophical
classification of poisons&mdash;one based neither upon symptoms, upon
local effects, nor upon chemical structure, but upon a collation and comparison
of all the properties of a poison, whether chemical, physical, or
physiological. No perfect systematic arrangement is at present attainable:
we are either compelled to omit all classification, or else to arrange
poisons with a view to practical utility merely.</p>

<p>From the latter point of view, an arrangement simply according to the
most prominent symptoms is a good one, and, without doubt, an assistance
to the medical man summoned in haste to a case of real or suspected
poisoning. Indeed, under such circumstances, a scheme somewhat similar
to the following, probably occurs to every one versed in toxicology:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<h4 class="classific">A. <span class="smcap">Poisons causing Death immediately, or in a few minutes.</span></h4>

<p>There are but few poisons which destroy life in a few minutes.
Omitting the strong mineral acids, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide,
with the irrespirable gases,&mdash;<i>Prussic acid</i>, <i>the cyanides</i>, <i>oxalic acid</i>, and
occasionally <i>strychnine</i>, are the chief poisons coming under this head.</p>

<h4 class="classific">B. <span class="smcap">Irritant Poisons</span> (symptoms mainly pain, vomiting, and purging).</h4>

<p><i>Arsenic</i>, <i>antimony</i>, <i>phosphorus</i>, <i>cantharides</i>, <i>savin</i>, <i>ergot</i>, <i>digitalis</i>,
<i>colchicum</i>, <i>zinc</i>, <i>mercury</i>, <i>lead</i>, <i>copper</i>, <i>silver</i>, <i>iron</i>, <i>baryta</i>, <i>chrome</i>, <i>yew</i>,
<i>laburnum</i>, <i>and putrid animal substances.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<h4 class="classific">C. <span class="smcap">Irritant and Narcotic Poisons</span> (symptoms those of an irritant
nature, with the addition of more or less pronounced cerebral
indications).</h4>

<p>To this class more especially belong <i>oxalic acid</i> and <i>the oxalates</i>, with
several poisons belonging to the purely narcotic class, but which produce
occasionally irritant effects.</p>

<h4 class="classific">D. <span class="smcap">Poisons more especially affecting the Nervous System.</span></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Narcotics</span> (chief symptom insensibility, which may be preceded
by more or less cerebral excitement): <i>Opium</i>, <i>Chloral</i>, <i>Chloroform</i>.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Deliriants</span> (delirium for the most part a prominent symptom):
<i>Belladonna</i>, <i>hyoscyamus</i>, <i>stramonium</i>, <i>with others of the Solanace&aelig;</i>,
to which may be added&mdash;<i>poisonous fungi</i>, <i>Indian hemp</i>, <i>lolium temulentum</i>,
<i>&#339;nanthe crocata</i>, and <i>camphor</i>.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Convulsives.</span>&mdash;Almost every poison has been known to produce
convulsive effects, but the only true convulsive poisons are the <i>alkaloids
of the strychnos class</i>.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Complex Nervous Phenomena</span>: <i>Aconite</i>, <i>digitalis</i>, <i>hemlock</i>, <i>calabar
bean</i>, <i>tobacco</i>, <i>lobelia inflata</i>, and <i>curara</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><a name="Sect_18" id="Sect_18"></a>&sect; 18. <span class="smcap">Kobert&#8217;s Classification.</span>&mdash;The latest authority on poisons&mdash;Kobert&mdash;has
classified poisons according to the following scheme:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<h4 class="classific">I. POISONS WHICH CAUSE COARSE ANATOMICAL CHANGES OF THE

<div class="kobert1">

<p>A. Those which specially irritate the part to which they are applied.</p>

<div class="kobert2">

<p>1. <i>Acids.</i></p>

<p>2. <i>Caustic alkalies.</i></p>

<p>3. <i>Caustic salts</i>, especially those of the heavy metals.</p>

<p>4. Locally irritating organic substances which neither can be classified as
corrosive acids nor alkalies, nor as corrosive salts; such are:&mdash;<i>cantharidine</i>,
<i>phrynine</i>, and others in the animal kingdom, <i>croton oil</i> and <i>savin</i>
in the vegetable kingdom. Locally irritating colours, such as the <i>aniline
dyes</i>.</p>

<p>5. Gases and vapours which cause local irritation when breathed, such as
<i>ammonia</i>, <i>chlorine</i>, <i>iodine</i>, <i>bromine</i>, and <i>sulphur dioxide</i>.</p>

</div><!--kobert2-->

<p>B. Those which have but little effect locally, but change anatomically other
parts of the body; such as <i>lead</i>, <i>phosphorus</i>, and others.</p>

</div><!--kobert1-->

<h4 class="classific">II. BLOOD POISONS.</h4>

<div class="kobert1">

<div class="kobert2">

<p>1. Blood poisons interfering with the circulation in a purely physical manner,
such as <i>peroxide of hydrogen</i>, <i>ricine</i>, <i>abrine</i>.</p>

<p>2. Poisons which have the property of dissolving the red blood corpuscle,

<p><a name="Sect_19" id="Sect_19"></a>&sect; 19. I have preferred an arrangement which, as far as possible,
follows the order in which a chemical expert would search for an
unknown poison&mdash;hence an arrangement partly chemical and partly
symptomatic. First the chief gases which figure in the mortality
statistics are treated, and then follow in order other poisons.</p>

<p>A chemist, given a liquid to examine, would naturally test first its
reaction, and, if strongly alkaline or strongly acid, would at once direct
his attention to the mineral acids or to the alkalies. In other cases, he
would proceed to separate volatile matters from those that were fixed,
lest substances such as prussic acid, chloroform, alcohol, and phosphorus
be dissipated or destroyed by his subsequent operations.</p>

<p>Distillation over, the alkaloids, glucosides, and their allies would next
be naturally sought, since they can be extracted by alcoholic and ethereal
solvents in such a manner as in no way to interfere with an <i>after</i>-search
for metals.</p>

<p>The metals are last in the list, because by suitable treatment, after all
organic substances are destroyed, either by actual fire or powerful
chemical agencies, even the volatile metals may be recovered. The
metals are arranged very nearly in the same order as that in which they
would be separated from a solution&mdash;viz., according to their behaviour
to hydric and ammoniac sulphides.</p>

<p>There are a few poisons, of course, such as the oxalates of the alkalies,
which might be overlooked, unless sought for specially; but it is hoped
that this is no valid objection to the arrangement suggested, which, in
greater detail, is as follows:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<h4 class="classific just"><b>A.&mdash;POISONOUS GASES.</b></h4>

<ol class="left">
<li>Carbon monoxide.</li>
<li>Chlorine.</li>
<li>Hydric sulphide.</li>

<li> Nitric acid.</li>
<li> Potash.</li>
<li> Soda.</li>
<li> Ammonia.</li>
<li> Neutral sodium, potassium, and ammonium salts.</li>
</ol>

<p>In nearly all cases of death from any of the above, the analyst, from
the symptoms observed during life, from the surrounding circumstances,
and from the pathological appearances and evident chemical reactions of
the fluids submitted, is put at once on the right track, and has no
difficulty in obtaining decided results.</p>

<h4 class="classific just"><b>C.&mdash;POISONOUS SUBSTANCES CAPABLE OF BEING SEPARATED

<ol class="left">
<li> Hydrocarbons.</li>

<li> Alcohols.</li>
<li> Amyl-nitrite.</li>

<li> Carbon disulphide.</li>
<li> Carbolic acid.</li>
<li> Nitro-benzene.</li>
<li> Prussic acid.</li>
<li> Phosphorus.</li>
</ol>

<p>The volatile alkaloids, which may also be readily distilled by strongly
alkalising the fluid, because they admit of a rather different mode of
treatment, are not included in this class.</p>

<h4 class="classific just"><b>D.&mdash;ALKALOIDS AND POISONOUS VEGETABLE PRINCIPLES

SOLVENTS.</b></h4>

<div class="ind2em">

<h5 class="classific just">DIVISION I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Vegetable Alkaloids.</span></h5>

<div class="ind2em">

<ol class="left">
<li> Liquid volatile alkaloids, alkaloids of hemlock, nicotine, piturie,
sparteine, aniline.</li>
<li> The opium group of alkaloids.</li>

<li> Colchicin.</li>
<li> Muscarine and the active principles of certain fungi.</li>
</ol>

</div>
</div>

<p>There would, perhaps, have been an advantage in arranging several of
the individual members somewhat differently&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, a group might be
made of poisons which, like pilocarpine and muscarine, are antagonistic
to atropine; and another group suggests itself, the physiological action
of which is the opposite of the strychnos class; solanin (although classed
as a mydriatic, and put near to atropine) has much of the nature of a
glucoside, and the same may be said of colchicin; so that, if the
classification were made solely on chemical grounds, solanin would have
followed colchicin, and thus have marked the transition from the
alkaloids to the glucosides.</p>

<p>The glucosides, when fairly pure, are easily recognised; they are
destitute of nitrogen, neutral in reaction, and split up into sugar and

<h3>III.&mdash;Statistics.</h3>

<p><a name="Sect_20" id="Sect_20"></a>&sect; 20. The number of deaths from poison (whether accidental, suicidal,
or homicidal), as compared with other forms of violent, as well as natural
deaths, possesses no small interest; and this is more especially true when
the statistics are studied in a comparative manner, and town be compared
with town, country with country.</p>

<p>The greater the development of commercial industries (especially those
necessitating the use or manufacture of powerful chemical agencies), the
more likely are accidents from poisons to occur. It may also be stated,
further, that the higher the mental development of a nation, the more
likely are its homicides to be caused by subtle poison&mdash;its suicides by
the euthanasia of chloral, morphine, or hemlock.</p>

<p>Other influences causing local diversity in the kind and frequency of
poisoning, are those of race, of religion, of age and sex, and the mental
stress concomitant with sudden political and social changes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>In the ten years from 1883-1892, there appear to have died from poison,
in England and Wales, 6616 persons, as shown in the following tables:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In each decade there are changes in the position on the list. The
most significant difference between the statistics now given and the
statistics for the ten years ending 1880, published in the last edition of
this work, is that in the former decade carbolic acid occupied a comparatively
insignificant place; whereas in the ten years ending 1892,
deaths from carbolic acid poisoning are the most frequent form of fatal
poisoning save lead and opiates.</p>

from prussic acid, from cyanide of potassium, and from opiates were all
more numerous than deaths from phenol, whereas at present phenol
appears to be the poison most likely to be chosen by a suicidal person.</p>

<h4>IV.&mdash;The Connection between Toxic Action and Chemical
Composition.</h4>

<p><a name="Sect_23" id="Sect_23"></a>&sect; 23. Considerable advance has been made of late years in the study
of the connection which exists between the chemical structure of the
molecule of organic substances and physiological effect. The results
obtained, though important, are as yet too fragmentary to justify any
great generalisation; the problem is a complicated one, and as Lauder
Brunton justly observes:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;The physiological action of a drug does not depend entirely on its
chemical composition nor yet on its chemical structure, so far as that
can be indicated even by graphic formula, but upon conditions of solubility,
instability, and molecular relations, which we may hope to discover
in the future, but with which we are as yet imperfectly acquainted.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>The occurrence of hydroxyl, whether the substance belong to the
simpler chain carbon series or to the aromatic carbon compounds, appears
to usually endow the substance with more or less active and frequently
poisonous properties, as, for example, in the alcohols, and as in hydroxylamine.
It is also found that among the aromatic bodies the toxic
action is likely to increase with the number of hydroxyls: thus phenol
has one hydroxyl, resorcin two, and phloroglucin three; and the toxic
power is strictly in the same order, for, of the three, phenol is least and
phloroglucin most poisonous.</p>

<p>Replacing hydrogen by a halogen, especially by chlorine, in the fatty
acids mostly produces substances of narcotic properties, as, for instance,
monochloracetic acid. In the sulphur compounds, the entrance of
chlorine modifies the physiological action and intensifies toxicity: thus
ethyl sulphide <span class="chemform">(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S</span> is a weak poison, monochlorethyl sulphide
<span class="chemform">C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>ClS</span> a strong poison, and dichlorethyl sulphide <span class="chemform">C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>S</span>
a very strong poison: the vapour kills rabbits within a short time, and
a trace of the oil applied to the ear produces intense inflammation of
both the eyes and the ear.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>The weight of the molecule has an influence in the alcohols and acids
of the fatty series; for instance, ethyl, propyl, butyl, and amyl alcohols
show as they increase in carbon a regular increase in toxic power; the
narcotic actions of sodium propionate, butyrate, and valerianate also
increase with the rising carbon. Nitrogen in the triad condition in
the amines is far less poisonous than in the pentad condition.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_24" id="Sect_24"></a>&sect; 24. The result of replacing hydrogen by alkyls in aromatic bodies
has been studied by Schmiedeberg and others; replacing the hydrogen of
the amidogen by ethyl or methyl, usually results in a body having a
more or less pronounced narcotic action. The rule is that methyl is
stronger than ethyl, but it does not always hold good; ortho-amido-phenol
is not in itself poisonous, but when two hydrogens of the
amidogen group are replaced by two methyls thus<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>the resulting body has a weak narcotic action.</p>

<p>It would naturally be inferred that the replacement of the H in the
hydroxyl by a third methyl would increase this narcotic action, but this
is not so: on the other hand, if there are three ethyl groups in the same
situation a decidedly narcotic body is produced.</p>

<p>The influence of position of an alkyl in the aromatic bodies is well
shown in ortho-, para- and meta-derivatives. Thus the author proved
some years ago that with regard to disinfecting properties, ortho-cresol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
was more powerful than meta-; meta-cresol more powerful than para-; so
again ortho-aceto-toluid is poisonous, causing acute nephritis; meta-aceto-toluid
has but feeble toxic actions but is useful as an antipyretic; and
para-aceto-toluid is inactive.</p>

<p>In the trioxybenzenes, in which there are three hydroxyls, the toxic
action is greater when the hydroxyls are consecutive, as in pyrogallol,
than when they are symmetrical, as in phloroglucin.</p>

<p>The introduction of methyl into the complicated molecule of an
alkaloid often gives curious results: thus methyl strychnine and methyl
brucine instead of producing tetanus have an action on voluntary muscle
like curare.</p>

<p>Benzoyl-ecgonine has no local an&aelig;sthetic action, but the introduction
of methyl into the molecule endows it with a power of deadening the
sensation of the skin locally; on the other hand, cocethyl produces no
effect of this kind.</p>

<p>Drs. Crum Brown and Fraser<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> have suggested that there is some
relation between toxicity and the saturated or non-saturated condition of

<p>Hinsberg and Treupel have studied the physiological effect of substituting
various alkyls for the hydrogen of the hydroxyl group in para-acetamido-phenol.</p>

<p>Para-aceto-amido-phenol when given to dogs in doses of 0.5 grm. for
every kilogr. of body weight causes slight narcotic symptoms, with slight
paralysis; there is cyanosis and in the blood much meth&aelig;moglobin.</p>

<p>In men doses of half a gramme (7&middot;7 grains) act as an antipyretic,
relieve neuralgia and have weak narcotic effects.</p>

<p>The following is the result of substituting certain alkyls for H in the
HO group.</p>

<p>(1) <b>Methyl.</b>&mdash;The narcotic action is strengthened and the antipyretic
action unaffected. The meth&aelig;moglobin in the blood is somewhat less.</p>

<p>(2) <b>Ethyl.</b>&mdash;Action very similar, but much less meth&aelig;moglobin is
produced.</p>

<p>(3) <b>Propyl.</b>&mdash;Antipyretic action a little weaker. Meth&aelig;moglobin in
the blood smaller than in para-acetamido-phenol, but more than when
the methyl or ethyl compound is administered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>(4) <b>Amyl.</b>&mdash;Antipyretic action decreased.</p>

<p>The smallest amount of toxicity is in the ethyl substitution; while
the maximum antipyretic and antineuralgic action belongs to the methyl
substitution.</p>

<p>Next substitution was tried in the Imid group. It was found that
substituting ethyl for H in the imid group annihilated the narcotic and
antipyretic properties. No meth&aelig;moglobin could be recognised in the
blood.</p>

<p>Lastly, simultaneous substitution of the H of the HO group by ethyl
and the substitution of an alkyl for the H in the NH group gave the
following results:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p><b>Methyl.</b>&mdash;In dogs the narcotic action was strengthened, the meth&aelig;moglobin
in the blood diminished. In men the narcotic action was also
more marked as well as the anti-neural action. The stomach and kidneys
were also stimulated.</p>

<p><b>Ethyl.</b>&mdash;In dogs the narcotic action was much strengthened, while
the meth&aelig;moglobin was diminished. In men the antipyretic and anti-neural
actions were unaffected.</p>

<p><b>Propyl.</b>&mdash;In dogs the narcotic action was feebler than with methyl or
ethyl, and in men there was diminished antipyretic action.</p>

<p><b>Amyl.</b>&mdash;In dogs the narcotic action was much smaller.</p>

<p>From this latter series the conclusion is drawn that the maximum of
narcotic action is obtained by the introduction of methyl and the maximum
antipyretic action by the introduction of methyl or ethyl. The
ethyl substitution is, as before, the less toxic.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>The effect of the entrance of an alkyl into the molecule of a substance
is not constant; sometimes the action of the poison is weakened, sometimes
strengthened. Thus, according to Stolnikow, dimethyl resorcin,
<span class="chemform">C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub></span>, is more poisonous than resorcin <span class="chemform">C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub></span>. Anisol

infusoria than phenol <span class="chemform">C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH</span>. On the other hand, the replacement
by methyl of an atom of hydrogen in the aromatic oxyacids weakens
their action; methyl salicylic acid <span class="structform"><img src="images/illo071a.png" alt="" width="82" height="40" /></span> is weaker than salicylic acid <span class="structform"><img src="images/illo071b.png" alt="" width="84" height="40" /></span>.</p>

<p>Arsen-methyl chloride, <span class="chemform">As(CH<sub>3</sub>)Cl<sub>2</sub></span>, is strongly poisonous, but the
introduction of a second methyl <span class="chemform">As(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl</span> makes a comparatively
weak poison.</p>

poison; thus, in allantoin there are three carbonyl (CO) groups; this
substance does not produce excitation of the spinal cord, but it heightens
muscular irritability and causes, like xanthin, muscular rigidity; alloxantin,
with a similar structure but containing six carbonyl groups, does
not possess this action.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_26" id="Sect_26"></a>&sect; 26. A theory of general application has been put forward and supported
with great ability by Oscar Loew<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> which explains the action of poisons
by presuming that living has a different composition to dead albumin;
the albumin of the chemist is a dead body of a definite composition and
has a stable character; living albumin, such as circulates in the blood or
forms the protoplasm of the tissues, is not &#8220;stable&#8221; but &#8220;labile&#8221;; Loew
says:&mdash;&#8220;If the old idea is accepted that living albumin is chemically the
same substance as that which is dead, numerous toxic phenomena are
inexplicable. It is impossible, for instance, to explain how it is that
diamide <span class="chemform">N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub></span> and hydroxylamine <span class="chemform">NH<sub>2</sub>OH</span> are toxic, even with great
dilution, on all living animals; whilst neither of those substances have
the smallest action on dead plasma or the ordinary dissolved passive
albumin, there must therefore be present in the albumin of the living
plasma a grouping of atoms in a &#8220;<i>labile</i>&#8221; condition (<i>Atomgruppirungen
labiler Art</i>) which are capable of entering into reactions; such, according
to our present knowledge, can only be the aldehyde and the ketone
groups. The first mentioned groups are more labile and react in far
greater dilution than the latter groups.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loew considers that all substances which enter into combination
with aldehyde or ketone groups must be poisonous to life generally.
For instance, hydroxylamine, diamide and its derivatives, phenylhydrazine,
free ammonia, phenol, prussic acid, hydric sulphide, sulphur
dioxide and the acid sulphites all enter into combination with aldehyde.</p>

<p>So again the formation of imide groups in the aromatic ring increases
any poisonous properties the original substance possesses, because the
imide group easily enters into combination with aldehyde; thus piperidine
<span class="chemform">(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>5</sub>NH</span> is more poisonous than pyridine <span class="chemform">(CH)<sub>5</sub>N</span>; coniine <span class="chemform">NH(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>CH-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub></span>,

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_38" id="Footnote_38"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> Th. Weyl (<i>Lehrbuch der organischen Chemie</i>) states (p. 385) that
amarin is not poisonous, but Baccheti (<i>Jahr. d. Chemie</i>, 1855) has
shown that 250 mgrms. of the acetate will kill a dog, 80 mgrms. a
guinea-pig; and that it is poisonous to fishes, birds, and frogs:
hydrobenzamide in the same doses has no effect.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>If the theory is true, then substances with &#8220;labile&#8221; amido groups, on
the one hand, must increase in toxic activity if a second amido group is
introduced; and, on the other, their toxic qualities must be diminished
if the amido group is changed into an imido group by the substitution of
an atom of hydrogen for an alkyl.</p>

<p>Observation has shown that both of these requirements are satisfied;
phenylenediamine is more poisonous than aniline; toluylenediamine
more poisonous than toluidine. Again, if an atom of hydrogen in the
amido (<span class="chemform">NH<sub>2</sub></span>) group in aniline be replaced by an alkyl, <i>e.g.</i> methyl or
ethyl, the resulting substance does not produce muscular spasm; but if
the same alkyl is substituted for an atom of hydrogen in the benzene
nucleus the convulsive action remains unaffected.</p>

<p>If an acidyl, as for example the radical of acetic acid, enter into the
amido group, then the toxic action is notably weakened; thus, acetanilide
is weaker than aniline, and acetylphenylhydrazine is weaker than
phenylhydrazine. If the hydrogen of the imido group be replaced by an
alkyl or an acid radical, and therefore tertiary bound nitrogen restored,
the poisonous action is also weakened.</p>

<p>In xanthin there are three imido groups; the hydrogen of two of
these groups is replaced by methyl in theobromin; and in caffein the
three hydrogens of the three imido groups are replaced by three methyls,
thus:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. Entrance of the carboxyl or sulpho groups weakens toxic action.</p>

<p>2. Entrance of a chlorine atom exalts the toxic character of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
catalytic poisons (Loew&#8217;s catalytic poisons are alcohols, ether, chloroform,
chloral, carbon tetrachloride, methylal, carbon disulphide and volatile
hydrocarbons).</p>

<p>3. Entrance of hydroxyl groups in the catalytic poisons of the fatty
series weakens toxic character; on the other hand, it exalts the toxicity
of the substituting poisons. (Examples of Loew&#8217;s class of &#8220;substituting&#8221;
poisons are hydroxylamine, phenylhydrazine, hydric cyanide, hydric
sulphide, aldehyde, and the phenols.)</p>

<p>4. A substance increases in poisonous character through every influence
which increases its power of reaction with aldehyde or amido groups. If,
for example, an amido or imido group in the poison molecule be made
more &#8220;labile,&#8221; or if thrice linked nitrogen is converted into nitrogen
connected by two bands, whether through addition of water or transposition
(<i>umlagerung</i>) or if a second amido group enters, the poisonous
quality is increased. Presence of a negative group may modify the
action.</p>

<p>5. Entrance of a nitro group strengthens the poisonous character. If
a carboxyl or a sulpho group is present in the molecule, or if, in passing
through the animal body, negative groups combine with the poison
molecule, or carboxyl groups are formed in the said molecule; in such
cases the poisonous character of the nitro group may not be apparent.</p>

<p>6. Substances with double carbon linkings are more poisonous than
the corresponding saturated substances. Thus neurine with the double
linking of the carbon of CH<sub>2</sub> is more poisonous than choline; vinylamine
than ethylamine.</p>

<h3>V.&mdash;Life-Tests; or the Identification of Poison by
Experiments on Animals.</h3>

<p><a name="Sect_28" id="Sect_28"></a>&sect; 28. A philosophical investigation of poisons demands a complete
methodical examination into their action on every life form, from the
lowest to the highest. Our knowledge is more definite with regard to
the action of poisons on man, dogs, cats, rabbits, and frogs than on any
other species.  It may be convenient here to make a few general remarks
as to the action of poisons on infusoria, the cephalopoda, and insects.</p>

<p><b>Infusoria.</b>&mdash;The infusoria are extremely sensitive to the poisonous
alkaloids and other chemical agents. Strong doses of the alkaloids cause
a contraction of the cell contents, and somewhat rapid disintegration of
the whole body; moderate doses at first quicken the movements, then
the body gets perceptibly larger, and finally, as in the first case, there is
disintegration of the animal substance.</p>

<p>Rossbach<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> gives the following intimations of the proportion of the
toxic principle necessary to cause death:&mdash;Strychnine 1 part dissolved
in 1500 of water; veratrine 1 in 8000; quinine 1 in 5000; atropine 1
in 1000; the mineral acids 1 in 400-600; salts 1 in 200-300.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_41" id="Footnote_41"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> N. J. Rossbach, <i>Pharm. Zeitschr. f&uuml;r Russland</i>, xix. 628.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>The extraordinary sensitiveness of the infusoria, and the small amount
of material used in such experiments, would be practically useful if there
were any decided difference in the symptoms produced by different
poisons. But no one could be at all certain of even the class to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the poison belongs were he to watch, without a previous knowledge of
what had been added to the water, the motions of poisoned infusoria.
Hence the fact is more curious than useful.</p>

<p><b>Cephalopoda.</b>&mdash;The action of a few poisons on the cephalopoda has
been investigated by M. E. Yung.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Curara placed on the skin had no
effect, but on the branchi&aelig; led to general paralysis. If given in even
fifteen times a greater dose than necessary to kill a rabbit, it was not
always fatal. Strychnine, dissolved in sea-water, in the proportion of 1
to 30,000, causes most marked symptoms. The first sign is relaxation
of the chromataphore muscle and the closing of the chromataphores; the
animal pales, the respiratory movements become more powerful, and
at the end of a notable augmentation in their number, they fall rapidly
from the normal number of 25 to 5 a minute. Then tetanus commences
after a time, varying with the dose of the poison; the arm stiffens
and extends in fan-like form, the entire body is convulsed, the respiration
is in jerks, the animal empties his pouch, and at the end of a few minutes
is dead, in a state of great muscular rigidity. If at this moment it is
opened, the venous heart is found still beating. Nicotine and other
poisons were experimented with, and the cephalopoda were found to be
generally sensitive to the active alkaloids, and to exhibit more or less
marked symptoms.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p><a name="Footnote_42" id="Footnote_42"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> <i>Compt. Rend.</i>, t. xci. p. 306.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p><b>Insects.</b>&mdash;The author devoted considerable time, in the autumn of 1882,
to observations on the effect of certain alkaloids on the common blow-fly,
thinking it possible that the insect would exhibit a sufficient series of
symptoms of physiological phenomena to enable it to be used by the
toxicologist as a living reagent. If so, the cheapness and ubiquity of the
tiny life during a considerable portion of the year would recommend it
for the purpose. Provided two blow-flies are caught and placed beneath
glass shades&mdash;the one poisoned, the other not&mdash;it is surprising what a
variety of symptoms can, with a little practice, be distinguished. Nevertheless,
the absence of pupils, and the want of respiratory and cardiac
movements, are, in an experimental point of view, defects for which no
amount or variety of merely muscular symptoms can compensate.</p>

<p>From the nature of the case, we can only distinguish in the poisoned
fly dulness or vivacity of movement, loss of power in walking on smooth
surfaces, irritation of the integument, disorderly movements of the limbs,
protrusion of the fleshy proboscis, and paralysis, whether of legs or wings.
My experiments were chiefly made by smearing the extracts or neutral
solutions of poisons on the head of the fly. In this way some of it is
invariably taken into the system, partly by direct absorption, and partly
by the insect&#8217;s efforts to free itself from the foreign substance, in which
it uses its legs and proboscis. For the symptoms witnessed after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
application of <a href="#SecSaponin">saponin</a>, <a href="#Sect_530">digitalin</a>, and <a href="#Sect_424">aconitine</a>, the reader is referred to
the articles on those substances.</p>

<p>In poisoning by sausages, bad meat, curarine, and in obscure cases
generally, in the present state of science, experiments on living animals
are absolutely necessary. In this, and in this way only, in very many
instances, can the expert prove the presence of zymotic, or show the
absence of chemical poison.</p>

<p>The Vivisection Act, however, effectually precludes the use of life-tests
in England save in licensed institutions. Hence the &#8220;methods&#8221; of
applying life-tests described in former editions will be omitted.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><a name="Sect_29" id="Sect_29"></a>&sect; 29. <b>Effect of poisons on the heart of Cold-blooded Animals.</b>&mdash;The Vivisection
Act does not, however, interfere with the use of certain living tests, such, for instance,
as the testing of the action of poisons
upon the recently extirpated hearts of
cold-blooded animals.</p>

</div>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig077" id="Fig077"></a>
<img src="images/illo077.jpg" alt="" width="275" height="506" />
<p class="caption">Williams&#8217; Apparatus.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The heart of the frog, of the turtle, of
the tortoise, and of the shark will beat
regularly for a long time after removal
from the body, if supplied with a regular
stream of nutrient fluid. The fluids used
for this purpose are the blood of the
herbivora diluted with common salt solution,
or a serum albumin solution, or a
2 per cent. solution of gum arabic in
which red blood corpuscles are suspended.
The simplest apparatus to use
is that known as &#8220;Williams&#8217;.&#8221; Williams&#8217;
apparatus consists of two glass
bulbs (see <a href="#Fig077">diagram</a>), the one, P, containing
nutrient fluid to which a known
quantity of the poison has been added;
the other, N, containing the same fluid
but to which no poison has been added;
these bulbs are connected by caoutchouc
tubing to a three-way tube, T, and each
piece of caoutchouc tubing has a pressure
screw clip, V<sup>1</sup> and V; the three-way tube
is connected with a wider tube containing
a valve float, F, which gives free
passage of fluid in one direction only,
that is, in the direction of the arrow;
this last wide tube is connected with a
Y  piece of tubing, which again is connected
with the aorta of the heart
under examination, the other leg of the
Y  tube is connected with another wide
tube, X, having a float valve, F&sup2;: the
float containing a drop of mercury and
permitting (like the float valve F)
passage in one direction only of fluid, it is obvious that if the clip communicating
with N is opened and the clip communicating with P is closed, the normal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"><span class="fsize110">[45]</span></a></span>
fluid will circulate alone through the heart; if, on the other hand, the P clip is open
and the N clip closed, the poisoned blood will alone feed the heart.  It is also clear
that by raising or depressing the bulbs, the circulating fluid can be delivered at any
pressure, high or low.  Should a bubble of air get into the tubes, it can be got rid of
by removing the cork at S and bringing the fluid up to the level of the top of the
aperture.  The observation is made by first ascertaining the number and character of
the beats when the normal fluid is circulating, and then afterwards when the normal
is replaced by the poisoned fluid. A simpler but less accurate process is to pith two
frogs, excise their respective hearts, and place the hearts in watch-glasses containing
either serum or a solution of common salt (strength 0&middot;75 per cent.); to the one
heart is now added a solution of the poison under examination, and the difference in
the behaviour and character of the beats noted.</p>

<p>The phenomena to be specially looked for are the following:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<ol class="left">
<li>The heart at the height of the poisoning is arrested in diastole.</li>
<li>The heart at the height of the poisoning is arrested in systole.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Arrest in diastole.</b>&mdash;The arrest may be preceded by the contractions becoming
weaker and weaker, or after the so-called heart peristalsis; or it may be preceded by a
condition in which the auricle shows a different frequency to the ventricle.</p>

<p>The final diastole may be the diastole of paralysis or the diastole of irritation.</p>

<p>The diastole of irritation is produced by a stimulus of the inhibitory ganglia, and
only occurs after poisoning by the muscarine group of poisons.  This condition may
be recognised by the fact that contraction may be excited by mechanical and electrical
stimuli or by the application of atropine solution; the latter paralyses the inhibitory
nervous centres, and therefore sets the mechanism going again.  The diastole of paralysis
is the most frequent form of death.  It may readily be distinguished from the
muscarine diastole; for, in muscarine diastole, the heart is full of blood and larger
than normal; but in the paralytic form the heart is not fully extended, besides which,
although, if normal blood replace that which is poisoned, the beats may be restored
for a short time, the response is incomplete, and the end is the same; besides which,
atropine does not restore the beats.  The diastole of paralysis may depend on paralysis
of the so-called excito-motor ganglia (as with iodal), or from paralysis of the muscular
structure (as with copper).</p>

<p><a name="Sect_30" id="Sect_30"></a>&sect; 30. <b>The effect of poisons on the iris.</b>&mdash;Several poisons affect the pupil, causing
either contraction or dilatation. The most suitable animal is the cat; the pupil of
the cat readily showing either state.</p>

<p><b>Toxic myosis, or toxic contraction of the pupil.</b>&mdash;There are two forms of toxic
myosis, one of which is central in its origin.  In this form, should the poison
be applied to the eye itself, no marked contraction follows; the poison must be
swallowed or injected subcutaneously to produce an effect.  The contraction remains
until death.</p>

<p>The contraction in such a case is considered to be due to a paralysis of the dilatation
centre; it is a &#8220;<i>myosis paralytica centralis</i>;&#8221; the best example of this is the contraction
of the pupil caused by morphine.</p>

<p>In the second case the poison, whether applied direct to the eye or entering the circulation
by subcutaneous injection, contracts the pupil; the contraction persists if
the eye is extirpated, but in all cases the contraction may be changed into dilatation
by the use of atropine.  An example of this kind of myosis is the action of muscarine.
It is dependent on the stimulation of the ends of the nerves which contract the pupil,
especially the ends of the <i>nervus oculomotorius</i> supplying the sphincter iridis; this
form of myosis is called <i>myosis spastica periphera</i>.  A variety of this form is the <i>myosis
spastica muscularis</i>, depending on stimulation of the musc. sphincter iridis, seen in
poisoning by physostigmine.  This causes strong contraction of the pupil when locally
applied; the contraction is not influenced by small local applications of atropine, but
it may be changed to dilatation by high doses.  Subcutaneous injection of small doses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"><span class="fsize110">[46]</span></a></span>
of physostigmine does not alter the pupil, but large poisonous doses contracts the
pupil in a marked manner.</p>

<p><b>Toxic mydriasis, or toxic dilatation of the pupil.</b>&mdash;The following varieties are to be
noticed:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1.  Toxic doses taken by the mouth or given by subcutaneous injection give rise
to strong dilatation; this vanishes before death, giving place to moderate contraction.
This form is due to stimulation of the dilatation centre, later passing into paralysis.
An example is found in the action of aconite.</p>

<p>2.  After subcutaneous or local application, a dilatation neutralised by physostigmine
in moderate doses. This is characteristic of &#946;-tetrahydronaphthylamine.</p>

<p>3.  After subcutaneous injection, or if applied locally in very small doses, dilatation
occurs persisting to death. Large doses of physostigmine neutralise the dilatation,
but it is not influenced by muscarine or pilocarpine: this form is characteristic of
atropine, and it has been called <i>mydriasis paralytica periphera</i>.</p>

<p>The heart at the height of the poisoning stops in systole.</p>

<p><b>2. Arrest in systole.</b>&mdash;The systole preceding the arrest is far stronger than normal,
the ventricle often contracting up into a little lump.  Contraction of this kind
is specially to be seen in poisoning by digitalis. In poisoning by digitalis the
ventricle is arrested before the auricle; in muscarine poisoning the auricle stops before
the ventricle.  If the reservoir of Williams&#8217; apparatus is raised so as to increase
the pressure within the ventricle the beat may be restored for a time, to again cease.</p>

<p>A frog&#8217;s heart under the influence of any poison may be finally divided into pieces
so as to ascertain if any parts still contract; the significance of this is, that the
particular ganglion supplying that portion of the heart has not been affected: the
chief ganglia to be looked for are Remak&#8217;s, on the boundary of the sinus and auricle;
Ludwig&#8217;s, on the auricle and the septum of the auricle; Bidder&#8217;s, on the atrioventricular
border, especially in the valves; and Dogiel&#8217;s ganglion, between the muscular
fibres.  According to Dogiel, poisons acting like muscarine affect every portion of the
heart, and atropine restores the contractile power of every portion.</p>

<h3>VI.&mdash;General Method of Procedure in Searching
for Poison.</h3>

<p><a name="Sect_31" id="Sect_31"></a>&sect; 31. Mineral substances, or liquids containing only inorganic matters,
can cause no possible difficulty to any one who is practised in analytical
investigation; but the substances which exercise the skill of the expert
are organic fluids or solids.</p>

<p>The first thing to be done is to note accurately the manner in which
the samples have been packed, whether the seals have been tampered
with, whether the vessels or wrappers themselves are likely to have
contaminated the articles sent; and then to make a very careful observation
of the appearance, smell, colour, and reaction of the matters, not
forgetting to take the weight, if solid&mdash;the volume, if liquid.  All these
are obvious precautions, requiring no particular directions.</p>

<p>If the object of research is the stomach and its contents, the contents
should be carefully transferred to a tall conical glass; the organ cut open,
spread out on a sheet of glass, and examined minutely by a lens, picking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
out any suspicious-looking substance for closer observation. The mucous
membrane should now be well cleansed by the aid of a wash-bottle, and
if there is any necessity for destroying the stomach, it may be essential
in important cases to have it photographed. The washings having been
added to the contents of the stomach, the sediment is separated and
submitted to inspection, for it must be remembered that, irrespective of
the discovery of poison, a knowledge of the nature of the food last eaten
by the deceased may be of extreme value.</p>

<p>If the death has really taken place from disease, and not from poison,
or if it has been caused by poison, and yet no definite hint of the
particular poison can be obtained either
by the symptoms or by the attendant
circumstances, the analyst has the
difficult task of endeavouring to initiate
a process of analysis which will
be likely to discover any poison in the
animal, vegetable, or mineral kingdom.
For this purpose I have devised the
following process, which differs from
those that have hitherto been published
mainly in the prominence given
to operations in a high vacuum, and
the utilisation of biological experiment
as a matter of routine. Taking one of
the most difficult cases that can occur&mdash;viz.,
one in which a small quantity
only of an organic solid or fluid is
available&mdash;the best method of procedure
is the following:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig080" id="Fig080"></a>
<img src="images/illo080.jpg" alt="Mercury pump" width="250" height="475" />
</div>

<p>A small portion is reserved and
examined microscopically, and, if
thought desirable, submitted to various
&#8220;cultivation&#8221; experiments.  The
greater portion is at once examined
for volatile matters, and having been placed in a strong flask, and, if
neutral or alkaline, feebly acidulated with tartaric acid, connected with a
second or receiving flask by glass tubing and caoutchouc corks.  The
caoutchouc cork of the receiving flask has a double perforation, so as to
be able, by a second bit of angle tubing, to be connected with the
mercury-pump described in the author&#8217;s work on &#8220;Foods,&#8221; the figure of
which is here repeated (see the accompanying <a href="#Fig080">figure</a>).  With a good
water-pump having a sufficient length of fall-tube, a vacuum may be also
obtained that for practical purposes is as efficient as one caused by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
mercury; if the fall-tube delivers outside the laboratory over a drain, no
offensive odour is experienced when dealing with putrid, stinking liquids.
A vacuum having been obtained, and the receiving-flask surrounded with
ice, a distillate for preliminary testing may be generally got without the
action of any external heat; but if this is too slow, the flask containing
the substances or liquid under examination may be gently heated by a
water-bath&mdash;water, volatile oils, a variety of volatile substances, such as
prussic acid, hydrochloric acid, phosphorus, &amp;c., if present, will distil
over.  It will be well to free in this way the substance, as much as
possible, from volatile matters and water.  When no more will come
over, the distillate may be carefully examined by redistillation and the
various appropriate tests.</p>

<p>The next step is to dry the sample thoroughly.  This is best effected
also in a vacuum by the use of the same apparatus, only this time the
receiving-flask is to be half filled with strong sulphuric
acid.  By now applying very gentle heat to the first
flask, and cooling the sulphuric acid receiver, even
such substances as the liver in twenty-four hours may
be obtained dry enough to powder.</p>

</div>

<p>Having by these means obtained a nearly dry friable
mass, it is reduced to a coarse powder, and extracted
with petroleum ether; the extraction may be effected
either in a special apparatus (as, for example, in a
large &#8220;Soxhlet&#8221;), or in a beaker placed in the &#8220;Ether
recovery apparatus&#8221; (see <a href="#Fig081">fig.</a>), which is adapted to
an upright condenser.  The petroleum extract is
evaporated and leaves the fatty matter, possibly contaminated
by traces of any alkaloid which the substance
may have contained; for, although most alkaloids are
insoluble in petroleum ether, yet they are taken up in small quantities
by oils and fats, and are extracted with the fat by petroleum ether.
It is hence necessary always to examine the petroleum extract by shaking
it up with water, slightly acidulated with sulphuric acid, which will
extract from the fat any trace of alkaloid, and will permit the discovery
of such alkaloids by the ordinary &#8220;group reagents.&#8221;</p>

<p>The substance now being freed for the most part from water and from
fat, is digested in the cold with absolute alcohol for some hours; the
alcohol is filtered off, and allowed to evaporate spontaneously, or, if speed
is an object, it may be distilled <i>in vacuo</i>.  The treatment is next with
hot alcohol of 90 per cent., and, after filtering, the dry residue is
exhausted with ether.  The ether and alcohol, having been driven off,
leave extracts which may be dissolved in water and tested, both
chemically and biologically, for alkaloids, glucosides, and organic acids.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
It must also be remembered that there are a few metallic compounds (as,
for example, corrosive sublimate) which are soluble in alcohol and
ethereal solvents, and must not be overlooked.</p>

<p>The residue, after being thus acted upon successively by petroleum, by
alcohol, and by ether, is both water-free and fat-free, and also devoid of
all organic poisonous bases and principles, and it only remains to treat it
for metals.  For this purpose, it is placed in a retort, and distilled once or
twice to dryness with a known quantity of strong, pure hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p>If arsenic, in the form of arsenious acid, were present, it would distil
over as a trichloride, and be detected in the distillate; by raising the
heat, the organic matter is carbonised, and most of it destroyed.  The
distillate is saturated with hydric sulphide, and any precipitate separated
and examined.  The residue in the retort will contain the fixed metals,
such as zinc, copper, lead, &amp;c. It is treated with dilute hydrochloric acid,
filtered, the filtrate saturated with <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span> and any precipitate collected.
The filtrate is now treated with sufficient sodic acetate to replace the
hydric chloride, again saturated with <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span> and any precipitate collected
and tested for <i>zinc</i>, <i>nickel</i>, and <i>cobalt</i>. By this treatment, viz.:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

</ol>

<p>&mdash;a very fair and complete analysis may be made from a small amount of
material.  The process is, however, somewhat faulty in reference to
<a href="#Sect_296">phosphorus</a>, and also to <a href="#Sect_703">oxalic acid and the oxalates</a>; these poisons, if
suspected, should be specially searched for in the manner to be more
particularly described in the sections treating of them.  In most cases,
there is sufficient material to allow of division into three parts&mdash;one for
organic poisons generally, one for inorganic, and a third for reserve in
case of accident.  When such is the case, although, for organic principles,
the process of vacuum distillation just described still holds good, it will
be very much the most convenient way not to use that portion for
metals, but to operate on the portion reserved for the inorganic poisons
as follows by destruction of the organic matter.</p>

<p>The destruction of organic matter through simple distillation by
means of pure hydrochloric acid is at least equal to that by sulphuric
acid, chlorate of potash, and the carbonisation methods. The object of
the chemist not being to dissolve every fragment of cellular tissue,
muscle, and tendon, but simply all mineral ingredients, the less organic
matter which goes into solution the better. That hydrochloric acid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
would fail to dissolve sulphate of baryta and sulphate of lead, and that
sulphide of arsenic is also almost insoluble in the acid, is no objection to
the process recommended, for it is always open to the analyst to treat
the residue specially for these substances.  The sulphides precipitated
by hydric sulphide from an acid solution are&mdash;arsenic, antimony, tin,
cadmium, lead, bismuth, mercury, copper, and silver.  Those not precipitated
are&mdash;iron, manganese, zinc, nickel, and cobalt.</p>

<p>As a rule, one poison alone is present; so that if there should be a
sulphide, it will belong only exceptionally to more than one metal.</p>

<p>The colour of the precipitate from hydric sulphide is either yellowish
or black.  The yellow and orange precipitates are sulphur, sulphides of
arsenic, antimony, tin, and cadmium.  In pure solutions they may be
almost distinguished by their different hues, but in solutions contaminated
by a little organic matter the colours may not be distinctive.  The sulphide
of arsenic is of a pale yellow colour; and if the very improbable circumstance
should happen that arsenic, antimony, and cadmium occur in the
same solution, the sulphide of arsenic may be first separated by ammonia,
and the sulphide of antimony by sulphide of sodium, leaving cadmic
sulphide insoluble in both processes.</p>

<p>The black precipitates are&mdash;lead, bismuth, mercury, copper, and silver.
The black sulphide is freed from arsenic, if present, by ammonia, and
digested with dilute nitric acid, which will dissolve all the sulphides, save
those of mercury and tin, so that if a complete solution is obtained (sulphur
flocks excepted), it is evident that both these substances are absent.  The
presence of copper is betrayed by the blue colour of the nitric acid solution,
and through its special reactions; lead, by the deep yellow precipitate
which falls by the addition of chromate of potash and acetate of soda to
the solution; bismuth, through a white precipitate on dilution with water.
If the nitric acid leaves a black insoluble residue, this is probably sulphide
of mercury, and should be treated with concentrated hydrochloric acid to
separate flocks of sulphur, evaporated to dryness, again dissolved, and
tested for mercury by iodide of potassium, copper foil, &amp;c., as described
in the article on <i><a href="#Sect_852">Mercury</a></i>.  <a href="#Sect_867">Zinc</a>, <a href="#Sect_873">nickel, and cobalt</a> are likewise tested
for in the filtrate as described in the respective articles on these metals.</p>

one of the remaining three parts to be distilled; a second to be investigated for

from part No. II. the residue may be added to No. III. for the purpose of

<h4>I. SUBSTANCES SEPARATED BY DISTILLATION.</h4>

<p>The substances are placed in a capacious flask, diluted if necessary with water to
the consistence of a thin soup, and tartaric acid added to distinct acid reaction, and
distilled.</p>

<h4>II. ORGANIC POISONS NOT VOLATILE IN ACID SOLUTION.</h4>

<p>Part No. II. is mixed with double its volume of absolute alcohol, tartaric acid
added to distinct acid reaction and placed in a flask connected with an inverted
Liebig&#8217;s condenser; it is then warmed for 15 to 20 minutes on the water-bath. After
cooling, the mixture is filtered, the residue well washed with alcohol and evaporated
to a thin syrup in a porcelain dish over the water-bath. The dish is then allowed to
cool and digested with 100 c.c. of water; fat and resinous matters separate, the
watery solution is filtered through Swedish paper previously moistened: if the fluid
filtrate is clear it may be at once shaken up with ether, but if not clear, and especially
if it is more or less slimy, it is evaporated again on the water-bath to the consistence
of an extract: the extract treated with 60 to 80 c.c. of absolute alcohol (which precipitates
mucus and dextrin-like substances), the alcohol evaporated off and the residue
taken up with from 60 to 80 c.c. of distilled water; it is then shaken up with ether,
as in Dragendorff&#8217;s process, and such substances as digitalin, picric acid, salicylic
acid, antipyrin and others separated in this way and identified.</p>

<p>After this treatment with ether, and the separation of the ether extract, the watery
solution is strongly alkalised with caustic soda and shaken up again with ether, which
dissolves almost every alkaloid save morphine and apomorphine; the ethereal extract
is separated and any alkaloid left identified by suitable tests.</p>

<p>The aqueous solution, now deprived of substances soluble in ether both from acid
and from solutions made alkaline by soda, is now investigated for morphine and
apomorphine; the apomorphine being separated by first acidifying a portion of the
alkaline solution with hydrochloric acid, then alkalising with ammonia and shaking
out with ether. The morphine is separated from the same solution by shaking out
with warm chloroform.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize110">[45]</span></a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<h4>III. METALS.</h4>

<p>The substances are placed in a porcelain dish and diluted with a sufficient quantity
of water to form a thin soup and 20 to 30 c.c. of pure hydrochloric acid added; the
dish is placed on the water-bath and 2 grms. of potassic chlorate added. The contents
are stirred from time to time, and successive quantities of potassic chlorate are again
added, until the contents are coloured yellow. The heating is continued, with, if
necessary, the addition of more acid, until all smell of chlorine has ceased. If there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"><span class="fsize110">[52]</span></a></span>
is considerable excess of acid, this is to be evaporated away by diluting with a little
water and continuing to heat on the water-bath.  The dish with its contents is
cooled, a little water added, and the fluid is then filtered.</p>

<p>The metals remaining on the filter are:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<ul class="left">
<li>Silver chloride,</li>
<li>Lead sulphate,</li>
<li>Barium sulphate;</li>
</ul>

<p>in the filtrate will be all the other metals.</p>

<p>The filtrate is put in a flask and heated to from 60 to 80 degrees and submitted
to a slow stream of hydric sulphide gas; when the fluid is saturated with the gas,
the flask is securely corked and allowed to rest for twelve hours; at the end of that
time the fluid is filtered and the filter washed with water saturated with hydric
sulphide.</p>

<p>The still moist sulphides remaining on the filter are treated with yellow ammonium
sulphide containing some free ammonia and washed with sulphide of ammonium
water.  Now remaining on the filter, if present at all, will be:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<ul class="left">
<li>Mercury sulphide,</li>
<li>Lead sulphide,</li>
<li>Copper sulphide,</li>
<li>Cadmium sulphide;</li>
</ul>

<p>in the filtrate may be:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<ul class="left">
<li>Arsenic sulphide,</li>
<li>Antimony sulphide,</li>
<li>Tin sulphide,</li>
</ul>

<p>and there may also be a small portion of copper sulphide, because the latter is somewhat
soluble in a considerable quantity of ammonium sulphide.</p>

<p>The filtrate from the original hydric sulphide precipitate will contain, if present,
the sulphides of zinc and chromium in solution.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h5>INVESTIGATION OF THE SULPHIDES SOLUBLE IN AMMONIUM
SULPHIDE, VIZ., ARSENIC, ANTIMONY, TIN.</h5>

<p>The ammonium sulphide solution is evaporated to dryness in a porcelain dish,
strong nitric acid added and again dried.  To this residue a little strong caustic soda
solution is added, and then it is intimately mixed with three times its weight of a
mixture composed of 2 of potassic nitrate to 1 of dry sodium hydrate.  This is now
cast, bit by bit, into a red-hot porcelain crucible.  The whole is heated until it has
melted into a colourless fluid.</p>

<p>Presuming the original mass contained arsenic, antimony, and tin, the melt
contains sodic arseniate, sodic pyro-antimonate, sodic stannate, and tin oxide; it
may also contain a trace of copper oxide.</p>

<p>The melt is cooled, dissolved in a little water, and sodium bicarbonate added so as
to change any caustic soda remaining into carbonate, and to decompose the small
amount of sodic stannate; the liquid is then filtered.</p>

<p>The filtrate will contain the arsenic as sodic arseniate; while on the filter there
will be pyro-antimonate of soda, tin oxide, and, possibly, a little copper oxide.</p>

<p>The recognition of these substances now is not difficult (see the separate articles
on <i><a href="#Sect_763">Antimony</a></i>, <i>Tin</i>, <i><a href="#Sect_867">Zinc</a></i>, <i><a href="#Sect_738">Arsenic</a></i>, <i><a href="#Sect_809">Copper</a></i>).</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h5>INVESTIGATION OF THE SULPHIDES INSOLUBLE IN SULPHIDE
OF AMMONIUM, VIZ., MERCURY, LEAD, COPPER, CADMIUM.</h5>

<p>If the precipitate is contaminated with organic matter, it is treated with hydrochloric
acid and potassic chlorate in the manner already described, <a href="#Page_51">p. 51</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"><span class="fsize110">[53]</span></a></span></p>

<p>Afterwards it is once more saturated with hydric sulphide, the precipitate is
collected on a filter, well washed, and the sulphides treated with moderately concentrated
nitric acid (1 vol. nitric acid, 2 vols. water). The sulphides are best
treated with this solvent on the filter; all the sulphides mentioned, save mercury
sulphide, dissolve and pass into the filtrate.  This mercury sulphide may be dissolved
by nitro-muriatic acid, the solution evaporated to dryness, the residue dissolved
in water acidified with hydrochloric acid and tested for mercury (see
&#8220;<a href="#Sect_853">Mercury</a>&#8221;).</p>

<p>The filtrate containing, it may be, nitrates of lead, copper and cadmium is
evaporated nearly to dryness and taken up in a very little water. The lead is
separated as sulphate by the addition of dilute sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>The filtered solution, freed from lead, is treated with ammonia to alkaline
reaction; if copper be present, a blue colour is produced, and this may be confirmed
by other tests (see &#8220;<a href="#Sect_809">Copper</a>&#8221;).  To detect cadmium in the presence of copper,
potassic cyanide is added to the blue liquid until complete decolorisation, and the
liquid treated with <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>; if cadmium be present, it is thrown down as a yellow
sulphide, while potassic cupro-cyanide remains in solution.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h5>SEARCH FOR ZINC AND CHROMIUM.</h5>

<p>The filtrate from the hydric sulphide precipitate is divided into two parts; the
one half is used in the search for zinc, the other half is used for chromium.</p>

<p><b>Search for Zinc.</b>&mdash;The liquid is alkalised with ammonia and then ammonium
sulphide is added.  There will always be a precipitate of a dark colour;
the precipitate will contain earthy phosphates, iron and, in some cases,
manganese. The liquid with the precipitate is treated with acetic acid to
strong acid reaction and allowed to stand for several hours. The portion of
the precipitate remaining undissolved is collected on a filter, washed, dried and
heated to redness in a porcelain crucible. The residue thus heated is cooled and
dissolved in a little dilute sulphuric acid. To the acid solution ammonia is added,
and any precipitate formed is treated with acetic acid; should the precipitate not
completely dissolve, phosphate of iron is present; this is filtered off, and if <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span> be
added to the filtrate, white zinc sulphide will come down (see &#8220;<a href="#Sect_867">Zinc</a>&#8221;).</p>

<p><b>Search for Chromium.</b>&mdash;The second part of the <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span> filtrate is evaporated to a thin
extract, mixed with double its weight of sodic nitrate, dried and cast, little by
little, into a red-hot porcelain crucible. When the whole is fully melted, the
crucible is removed from the flame, cooled, and the mass dissolved in water and
filtered. Any chromium present will now be in solution in the easily recognised
form of potassic chromate (see &#8220;<a href="#Sect_892">Chromium</a>&#8221;).</p>

<h5>INVESTIGATION OF THE RESIDUE (<span class="nobold"><a href="#Page_52">p. 52</a></span>) AFTER THE TREATMENT
OF THE ORIGINAL SUBSTANCE WITH HYDROCHLORIC ACID
AND POTASSIC CHLORATE FOR PRESENCE OF SILVER CHLORIDE,
LEAD AND BARIUM SULPHATES.</h5>

<p>The residue is dried and intimately mixed with three times its weight of a
mixture containing 2 parts of sodic nitrate and 1 part of sodium hydrate,
This is added, little by little, into a red-hot porcelain crucible. The melted mass is
cooled, dissolved in a little water, a current of <span class="chemform">CO<sub>2</sub></span> passed through the solution to
convert any caustic soda into carbonate, and the solution boiled.  The result will be
an insoluble portion consisting of carbonates of lead and baryta, and of metallic
silver. The mixture is filtered; the insoluble residue on the filter is warmed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"><span class="fsize110">[54]</span></a></span>
some time with dilute nitric acid; the solution of nitrates of silver, lead and barium
are concentrated on the water-bath nearly to dryness so as to get rid of any excess
of acid, and the nitrates dissolved in water; then the silver is precipitated by
hydrochloric acid, the lead by <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>, and the barium by sulphuric acid.</p>

<h3>VII.&mdash;The Spectroscope as an aid to the Identification
of certain Poisons.</h3>

<p><a name="Sect_33" id="Sect_33"></a>&sect; 33. The spectra of many of the metals, of phosphine, of arsine and
of several other inorganic substances are characteristic and easily obtained.</p>

<p>It is, however, from the employment of the <i>micro-spectroscope</i> that the
toxicologist is likely to get most assistance.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illo087.jpg" alt="Spectroscope" width="300" height="361" />
</div>

<p>Oscar Brasch<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> has within the last few years studied spectroscopy in
relation to the alkaloids and organic poisons. Some of these, when mixed
with Froehde&#8217;s reagent, or with sulphuric
acid, or with sulphuric acid and potassic
dichromate, or with nitric acid, give
characteristic colours, and the resulting
solutions, when examined by a spectroscope,
for the most part show absorption
bands; these bands may, occasionally,
assist materially in the identification
of a poison.  By far the best
apparatus is a micro-spectroscope of
the Sorby and Browning type, to which
is added an apparatus for measuring the
position on a scale of the lines and
bands.  Seibert and Kraft of Wetzlar
make an excellent instrument, in which
a small bright triangle is projected
on the spectrum; this can be moved by a screw, so that the apex
may be brought exactly in the centre of any line or band, and its
position read on an outside scale.  The first thing to be done with
such an instrument is to determine the position on the scale of the chief
Fraunhofer lines or of the more characteristic lines of the alkalies
and alkaline earths,<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> the wave lengths of which are accurately known.
If, now, the scale divisions are set out as absciss&aelig;, and the wave lengths
in millionths of a millimetre are made the ordinates of a diagram, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55<br />56]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a></span>
an equable curve plotted out, as fully explained in the author&#8217;s work
on &#8220;Foods,&#8221; it is easy to convert the numbers on the scale into wave
lengths, and so make the readings applicable to any spectroscope. For
the purpose of graphical illustration the curve method is convenient,
and is adopted in the preceding diagrams, all taken from Oscar Brasch&#8217;s
monograph. Where the curve is highest there the absorption band is
thickest; where the curve is lowest there the band is weak. The fluid
to be examined is simply placed in a watch-glass, the watch-glass resting
on the microscope stand.</p>

<h4>Examination of Blood, or of Blood-Stains.</h4>

<p><a name="Sect_34" id="Sect_34"></a>&sect; 34. Spots, supposed to be blood&mdash;whether on linen, walls, or
weapons&mdash;should, in any important case, be photographed before any
chemical or microscopical examination is undertaken. Blood-spots,
according to the nature of the material to which they are adherent, have
certain naked eye peculiarities&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, blood on fabrics, if dry, has at first
a clear carmine-red colour, and part of it soaks into the tissue. If, however,
the tissue has been worn some time, or was originally soiled, either
from perspiration, grease, or filth, the colour may not be obvious or very
distinguishable from other stains; nevertheless, the stains always impart
a certain stiffness, as from starch, to the tissue. If the blood has fallen
on such substances as wood or metal, the spot is black, has a bright
glistening surface, and, if observed by a lens, exhibits radiating fissures
and a sort of pattern, which, according to some, is peculiar to each
species; so that a skilled observer might identify occasionally, from the
pattern alone, the animal whence the blood was derived. The blood is
dry and brittle, and can often be detached, or a splinter of it, as it were,
obtained. The edges of the splinter, if submitted to transmitted light,
are observed to be red. Blood upon iron is frequently very intimately
adherent; this is specially the case if the stain is upon rusty iron, for
h&aelig;matin forms a compound with iron oxide. Blood may also have to be
recovered from water in which soiled articles have been washed, or from
walls, or from the soil, &amp;c. In such cases the spot is scraped off from
walls, plaster, or masonry, with as little of the foreign matters as may be.
It is also possible to obtain the colouring-matter of blood from its solution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
in water, and present it for farther examination in a concentrated form,
by the use of certain precipitating agents (see <a href="#Page_61">p. 61</a>).</p>

<p>In the following scheme for the examination of blood-stains, it is
presumed that only a few spots of blood, or, in any case, a small quantity,
is at the analyst&#8217;s disposal.</p>

<p>(1) The dried spot is submitted to the action of a cold saturated
solution of borax. This medium (recommended by Dragendorff)<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> does
certainly dissolve out of linen and cloth blood-colouring matter with
great facility. The best way to steep the spots in the solution is to
scrape the spot off the fabric, and to digest it in about a cubic centimetre
of the borax solution, which must not exceed 40&deg;; the coloured solution
may be placed in a little glass cell, with parallel walls, &middot;5 centimetre
broad, and &middot;1 deep, and submitted to spectroscopic examination, either
by the ordinary spectroscope or by the micro-spectroscope; if the latter
is used, a very minute quantity can be examined, even a single drop. In
order to interpret the results of this examination properly, it will be
necessary to be intimately acquainted with the spectroscopic appearances
of both ancient and fresh blood.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_35" id="Sect_35"></a>&sect; 35. <b>Spectroscopic Appearances of Blood.</b>&mdash;If defibrinated blood<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
be diluted with water until it contains about &middot;01 per cent. of oxyh&aelig;moglobin,
and be examined by a spectroscope, the layer of liquid being 1
centimetre thick, a single absorption band between the wave lengths 583
and 575 is observed, and, under favourable circumstances, there is also to
be seen a very weak band from 550 to 532. With solutions so dilute as
this, there is no absorption at either the violet or the red end of the
spectrum. A solution containing &middot;09 per cent. of oxyh&aelig;moglobin shows
very little absorption in the red end, but the violet end is dark up
to about the wave length 428. Two absorption bands may now be
distinctly seen. A solution containing &middot;37 per cent. of oxyh&aelig;moglobin
shows absorption of the red end to about W.L. 720; the violet is entirely,
the blue partly, absorbed to about 453. The bands are considerably
broader, but the centre of the bands occupies the same relative position.
A solution containing as much as &middot;8 per cent. of oxyh&aelig;moglobin is very
dark; the two bands have amalgamated, the red end of the spectrum is
absorbed nearly up to Fraunhofer&#8217;s line a; the green is just visible
between W.L. 498 and 518. Venous blood, or arterial blood, which has
been treated with reducing agents, such, for example, as an alkaline
sulphide, gives the spectrum of reduced h&aelig;moglobin. If the solution is
equivalent to about &middot;2 per cent., a single broad band, with the edges very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
little defined, is seen to occupy the space between W.L. 595 and 538,
the band being darkest about 550; both ends of the spectrum are
more absorbed than by a solution of oxyh&aelig;moglobin of the same strength.
In the blood of persons or animals poisoned with hydric sulphide&mdash;to the
spectrum of reduced h&aelig;moglobin, there is added a weak absorption band
in the red, with its centre nearly corresponding with the Fraunhofer line
C. Blood which has been exposed to carbon oxide has a distinct
spectrum, due, it would seem, to a special combination of this gas with
h&aelig;moglobin; in other words, instead of oxygen, the oxygen of oxyh&aelig;moglobin
has been displaced by carbon oxide, and crystals of carbon oxide-h&aelig;moglobin,
isomorphous with those of oxyh&aelig;moglobin, may be obtained
by suitable treatment. The spectrum of carbon oxide-h&aelig;moglobin, however,
differs so little from that of normal blood, that it is only comparison
with the ordinary spectrum, or careful measurements, which will enable
any person, not very familiar with the different spectra of blood, to detect
it; with careful and painstaking observation the two spectra are seen to
be distinct. The difference between the carbon oxide and the normal
spectrum essentially consists in a slight moving of the bands nearer to E.
According to the measurements of Gamgee, the band &#945; of CO-h&aelig;moglobin
has its centre approximately at W.L. 572, and the band &#946; has for its
centre W.L. from 534 to 538, according to concentration. If a small
quantity of an ammoniacal solution of ferrous tartrate or citrate be added
to blood containing carbon oxide, the bands do not wholly fade, but
persist more or less distinctly; whereas, if the same solution is added to
bright red normal blood, the two bands vanish instantly and coalesce to
form the spectrum of reduced h&aelig;moglobin. When either a solution of
h&aelig;moglobin or blood is exposed to the air for some time, it loses its
bright red colour, becomes brownish-red, and presents an acid reaction.
On examining the spectrum, the two bands have become faint, or quite
extinct; but there is a new band, the centre of which (according to
Gamgee) occupies W.L. 632, but (according to Preyer) 634. In solutions
of a certain strength, four bands may be seen, but in a strong solution
only one. This change in the spectrum is due to the passing of the
h&aelig;moglobin into <i>meth&aelig;moglobin</i>, which may be considered as an intermediate
stage of decomposition, prior to the breaking up of the h&aelig;moglobin
into h&aelig;matin and proteids.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_49" id="Footnote_49"></a><a href="#FNanchor_49"><span class="label">[49]</span></a> In this brief notice of the spectroscopic appearances of the blood,
the measurements in wave lengths are, for the most part, after
Gamgee.&mdash;<i>Text-Book of Physiological Chemistry</i>, London, 1880.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>A spectrum very similar to that of meth&aelig;moglobin is obtained by
treating ancient blood-stains with acetic acid&mdash;viz., the spectrum of <i>acid
h&aelig;matin</i>, but the band is nearer to its centre, according to Gamgee,
corresponding to W.L. 640 (according to Preyer, 656&middot;6). The portion
of the band is a little different in alkaline solution, the centre being
about 592. H&aelig;matin is one of the bodies into which h&aelig;moglobin splits
up by the addition of such agents as strong acetic acid, or by the decomposing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
influence of exposure; the view most generally accepted being
that the colouring-matter of the blood is h&aelig;matin in combination with
one or more albuminoid bodies. The h&aelig;matin obtained by treating blood
with acetic acid may be dissolved out by ether, and the ethereal solution
then exhibits a remarkable distinctive spectrum. Hence, in the spectroscopic
examination of blood, or solutions of blood, for medico-legal purposes,
if the blood is fresh, the spectrum likely to be seen is either that
of oxyh&aelig;moglobin or h&aelig;moglobin; but, if the blood-stain is not recent,
then the spectrum of either h&aelig;matin or meth&aelig;moglobin.</p>

<p>The colouring-matter of cochineal, to which alum, potassic carbonate,
and tartrate have been added, gives a spectrum very similar to that of
blood (see &#8220;Foods,&#8221; p. 82); but this is only the case when the solution is
fresh. The colour is at once discharged by chlorine, while the colour
of blood, although changed in hue, remains. The colouring-matter of
certain red feathers, purpurin-sulphuric acid, and a few other reds, have
some similarity to either the h&aelig;matin or the h&aelig;moglobin spectrum, but
the bands do not strictly coincide; besides, no one would trust to a single
test, and none of the colouring-matters other than blood yield h&aelig;matin.</p>

<p>The blood in <span class="chemform">CO</span> poisoning has also other characteristics. It is of a
peculiar florid vermilion colour, a colour that is very persistent, lasting
for days and even weeks.</p>

<p>Normal blood mixed with 30 per cent. potash solution forms <i>greenish</i>
streaky clots, while blood charged with <span class="chemform">CO</span> forms red streaky clots.</p>

<p>Normal blood diluted to 50 times its volume of water, and then
treated successively with yellow ammonium sulphide in the proportion
of 2 to 25 c.c. of blood, followed by three drops of acetic acid, gives a
grey colour, while <span class="chemform">CO</span> blood remains bright red. <span class="chemform">CO</span> blood shaken with
4 times its volume of lead acetate remains red, but normal blood
becomes brown.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Solutions of platinum chloride or zinc chloride give a bright red
colour with <span class="chemform">CO</span> blood; normal blood is coloured brown or very dark
brown.</p>

<p>Phospho-molybdic acid or 5 per cent. phenol gives a carmine-coloured
precipitate with <span class="chemform">CO</span> blood, but a reddish-brown precipitate with normal
blood (sensitive to 16 per cent.).</p>

<p>A mixture of 2 c.c. of dilute acetic acid and 15 c.c. of 20 per cent.
potassic ferrocyanide solution added to 10 c.c. of <span class="chemform">CO</span> blood produces an
intense bright red; normal blood becomes dark brown.</p>

<p>Four parts of <span class="chemform">CO</span> blood, diluted with 4 parts of water and shaken
with 3 vols. of 1 per cent. tannin solution, become at first bright red
with a bluish tinge, and remain so persistently. Normal blood, on the

the end of 1 hour it becomes brownish, and finally in 24 hours grey.

<p>Stevenson, in one of the cases detailed at <a href="#Page_67">p. 67</a>, found the blood in
the right auricle to contain 0&middot;03 per cent. by weight of <span class="chemform">CO</span>.</p>

<p>(2) <b>Preparation of H&aelig;matin Crystals</b>&mdash;(Teichmann&#8217;s crystals).&mdash;A
portion of the borax solution is diluted with 5 or 6 parts of water,
and one or more drops of a 5 or 6 per cent. solution of zinc acetate
added, so long as a brownish-coloured precipitate is thrown down. The
precipitate is filtered off by means of a miniature filter, and then removed
on to a watch-glass. The precipitate may now be dissolved in 1 or
2 c.c. of acetic acid, and examined by the spectroscope it will show the
spectrum of h&aelig;matin. A minute crystal of sodic chloride being then
added to the acetic acid solution, it is allowed to evaporate to dryness at
the ordinary temperature, and crystals of h&aelig;matin hydrochlorate result.
There are other methods of obtaining the crystals. When a drop of
fresh blood is simply boiled with glacial acetic acid, on evaporation,
prismatic crystals are obtained.</p>

<p>H&aelig;matin is insoluble in water, alcohol, chloroform, and in cold dilute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
acetic and hydrochloric acids. It may, however, be dissolved in an
alcoholic solution of potassic carbonate, in solutions of the caustic alkalies,
and in boiling acetic and hydrochloric acids. Hoppe-Seyler ascribes to
the crystals the formula <span class="chemform">C<sub>68</sub>H<sub>70</sub>N<sub>8</sub>Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>10</sub>2HCl</span>. Thudichum considers
that the pure crystals contain no
chlorine, and are therefore those of
h&aelig;matin. It is the resistance of
the h&aelig;matin to decomposition and
to ordinary solvents that renders it
possible to identify a certain stain
to be that of blood, after long periods
of time. Dr. Tidy seems to have
been able to obtain blood reactions
from a stain which was supposed to
be 100 years old. The crystals are
of a dark-red colour, and present themselves in three forms, of which
that of the rhombic prism is the most common (see <a href="#Fig094">fig.</a>). But crystals
like <i>b</i>, having six sides, also occur, and also crystals similar to <i>c</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>If the spot under examination has been scraped off an iron implement
the h&aelig;matin is not so easily extracted, but Dragendorff states that borax
solution at 50&deg; dissolves it, and separates it from the iron. Felletar has
also extracted blood in combination with iron rust, by means of warm
solution of caustic potash, and, after neutralisation with acetic acid, has
precipitated the h&aelig;min by means of tannin, and obtained from the tannin
precipitate, by means of acetic acid, Teichmann&#8217;s crystals. A little of the
rust may also be placed in a test tube, powdered ammonium chloride
added, also a little strong ammonia, and after a time filtered; a small
quantity of the filtrate is placed on a slide with a crystal of sodium
chloride and evaporated at a gentle heat, then glacial acetic acid
added and allowed to cool; in this way h&aelig;min crystals have been obtained
from a crowbar fifty days after having been blood-stained.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>(3) <b>Guaiacum Test.</b>&mdash;This test depends upon the fact that a solution
of h&aelig;moglobin develops a beautiful blue colour, if brought into contact
with fresh tincture of guaiacum and peroxide of hydrogen. The simplest
way to obtain this reaction is to moisten the suspected stain with distilled
water; after allowing sufficient time for the water to dissolve out some
of the blood constituents, moisten a bit of filter-paper with the weak
solution thus obtained; drop on to the moist space a single drop of
tincture of guaiacum which has been prepared by digesting the inner
portions of guaiacum resin in alcohol, and which has been already tested
on known blood, so as to ascertain that it is really good and efficient for
the purpose; and, lastly, a few drops of peroxide of hydrogen. Dragendorff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
uses his borax solution, and, after a little dilution with water, adds
the tincture and then Heunefeld&#8217;s turpentine solution, which is composed
of equal parts of absolute alcohol, chloroform, and French turpentine, to
which one part of acetic acid has been added. The chloroform separates,
and, if blood was present, is of a blue colour.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_36" id="Sect_36"></a>&sect; 36. To prove by chemical and physical methods that a certain stain
is that of blood, is often only one step in the inquiry, the next question
being whether the blood is that of man or of animals. The blood-corpuscles
of man are larger than those of any domestic animal inhabiting
Europe. The diameter of the average red blood-corpuscle is about the
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>126</sub> of a millimetre, or 7&middot;9 &micro;.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> The corpuscles of man and of mammals,
generally speaking, are round, those of birds and reptiles oval, so that
there can be no confusion between man and birds, fishes or reptiles; if
the corpuscles are circular in shape the blood will be that of a mammal.
By careful measurements, Dr. Richardson, of Pennsylvania, affirms that
it is quite possible to distinguish human blood from that of all common
animals. He maintains, and it is true, that, by using very high magnifying
powers and taking much trouble, an expert can satisfactorily identify
human blood, if he has some half-dozen drops of blood from different
animals&mdash;such as the sheep, goat, horse, dog, cat, &amp;c., all fresh at hand
for comparison, and <i>if the human blood is normal</i>. However, when we
come to the blood of persons suffering from disease, there are changes in
the diameter and even the form of the corpuscles which much complicate
the matter; while, in blood-stains of any age, the blood-corpuscles, even
with the most artfully-contrived solvent, are so distorted in shape that he
would be a bold man who should venture on any definite conclusion as
to whether the blood was certainly human, more especially if he had to
give evidence in a criminal case.</p>

of ash, there is a means of distinguishing human blood from that of other
common mammals, which has been neglected by authorities on the subject,
and which may be found of real value. Its principle depends upon the
relative amounts of potassium and sodium in the blood of man as compared
with that in the blood of domestic animals. In the blood of the cow,
sheep, fowl, pig, and horse, the sodium very much exceeds the potassium
in the ash; thus the proportion of sodium oxide to that of potassium
oxide in the blood of the sheep is as <span class="chemform">K<sub>2</sub>O</span> &middot;1&nbsp;: <span class="chemform">Na<sub>2</sub>O</span> &middot;6; in that of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
cow, as 1&nbsp;: 8; in that of the domestic fowl, as 1&nbsp;: 16; while the same
substances in human blood are sometimes equal, and vary from
1&nbsp;: 1 to 1&nbsp;: 4 as extremes, the mean numbers being as 1&nbsp;: 2&middot;2. The
potassium is greater in quantity in the blood-corpuscles than in the
blood serum; but, even in blood serum, the same marked differences
between the blood of man and that of many animals is apparent. Thus,
the proportion of potash to soda being as 1&nbsp;: 10 in human blood, the
proportion in sheep&#8217;s blood is 1 to 15&middot;7; in horse&#8217;s serum as 1 to 16&middot;4;
and in the ox as 1 to 17. Since blood, when burnt, leaves from 6 to 7
per thousand of ash, it follows that a quantitative analysis of the relative
amounts of potassium and sodium can only be satisfactorily effected when
sufficient of the blood is at the analyst&#8217;s disposal to give a weighable
quantity of mineral matter. On the other hand, much work requires to
be done before this method of determining that the blood is either
human, or, at all events, not that of an herbivorous animal, can be relied
on. We know but little as to the effect of the ingestion of sodium or
potassium salts on either man or animals, and it is possible&mdash;nay, probable&mdash;that
a more or less entire substitution of the one for the other
may, on certain diets, take place. Bunge seems in some experiments to
have found no sodium in the blood of either the cat or the dog.</p>

<p>The source from which the blood has emanated may, in a few cases,
be conjectured from the discovery, by microscopical examination, of hair
or of buccal, nasal, or vaginal epithelium, &amp;c., mixed with the blood-stain.</p>

<h2>PART III.&mdash;POISONOUS GASES: CARBON MONOXIDE&mdash;CHLORINE&mdash;HYDRIC
SULPHIDE.</h2>

<hr class="sec" />

<h3>I.&mdash;Carbon Monoxide.</h3>

<p><a name="Sect_37" id="Sect_37"></a>&sect; 37. Carbon monoxide, <span class="chemform">CO</span>, is a colourless, odourless gas of 0&middot;96709
sp. gravity. A litre weighs 1&middot;25133 grm. It is practically insoluble in
water. It unites with many metals, forming gaseous or volatile compounds,
<i>e.g.</i>, nickel carbon oxide, <span class="chemform">Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub></span>, is a fluid volatilising at 40&deg;.
These compounds have, so far as is known, the same effects as <span class="chemform">CO</span>.</p>

<p>Whenever carbon is burned with an insufficient supply of air, <span class="chemform">CO</span> in a
certain quantity is produced. It is always present in ordinary domestic
products of combustion, and must be exhaled from the various chimneys
of a large city in considerable volumes. A &#8220;smoky&#8221; chimney or a defective
flue will therefore introduce carbon monoxide into living-rooms.
The vapour from burning coke or burning charcoal is rich in carbon monoxide.
It is always a constituent of coal gas, in England the carbon monoxide
in coal gas amounting to about 8 per cent. Poisoning by coal gas is
practically poisoning by carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide is also the
chief constituent in water gas.</p>

<p>Carbon monoxide poisoning occurs far more frequently in France and
Germany than in England; in those countries the vapour evolved from
burning charcoal is a favourite method of suicide, on account of the supposed
painlessness of the death. It has also occasionally been used as an
instrument of murder. In this country carbon monoxide poisoning
mainly takes place accidentally as the effect of breathing coal gas; possibly
it is the secret and undetected cause of ill health where chimneys &#8220;smoke&#8221;;
and it may have something to do with the sore throats and debility so often
noticed when persons breathe for long periods air contaminated by small
leakages of coal gas.</p>

<p>The large gas-burners (geysers) emit in burning under certain conditions
much carbon monoxide. It has been proved by Gr&eacute;hant<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> that a
bunsen burner &#8220;lit below&#8221; also evolves large quantities of the same
poisonous gas.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p><a name="Sect_38" id="Sect_38"></a>&sect; 38. <b>Symptoms.</b>&mdash;Nearly all the experience with regard to the symptoms
produced by carbon monoxide is derived from breathing not the pure
gas, but the gas diluted by air, by hydrogen or by carburetted hydrogen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
as in coal gas, or mixed with large quantities of carbon dioxide. Two
assistants of Christison breathed the pure gas: the one took from two to
three inhalations; he immediately became giddy, shivered, had headache
and then became unconscious. The second took a bigger dose, for, after
emptying his lungs as much as possible, he took from three to four inhalations;
he fell back paralysed, became unconscious and remained half-an-hour
insensible and had the appearance of death, the pulse being almost
extinguished. He was treated with inhalations of oxygen, but he remained
for the rest of the day extremely ill; he had convulsive muscular
movements, stupor, headache, and quick irregular pulse; on this passing
away he still suffered from nausea, giddiness, alternate feeling of heat and
chilliness, with some fever, and in the night had a restless kind of sleep.
The chemist Chenot was accidentally poisoned by the pure gas, and is
stated to have fell as if struck by lightning after a single inspiration, and
remained for a quarter of an hour unconscious. Other recorded cases
have shown very similar symptoms.</p>

<p>The pulse is at the onset large, full and frequent; it afterwards becomes
small, slow and irregular. The temperature sinks from 1&deg; to 3&deg; C.
The respiration at first slow, later becomes rattling. As vomiting occurs
often when the sufferer is insensible, the vomited matters have been
drawn by inspiration into the trachea and even into the bronchi, so that
death takes place by suffocation.</p>

<p>The fatal coma may last even when the person has been removed from
the gas from hours to days. Coma for three, four and five days from
carbon monoxide has been frequently observed. The longest case on
record is that of a person who was comatose for eight days, and died on
the twelfth day after the fatal inhalation. Consciousness in this case
returned, but the patient again fell into stupor and died.</p>

<p>The slighter kinds of poisoning by carbon monoxide, as in the Staffordshire
case recorded by Dr. Reid, in which for a long time a much diluted
gas has been breathed, produce pronounced headache and a general feeling
of ill health and <i>malaise</i>, deepening, it may be, into a fatal slumber, unless
the person is removed from the deadly atmosphere. To the headache
generally succeeds nausea, a feeling of oppression in the temples, a noise
in the ears, feebleness, anxiety and a dazed condition deepening into coma.
It is probably true that charcoal vapour is comparatively painless, for
when larger amounts of the gas are breathed the insensibility comes on
rapidly and the faces of those who have succumbed as a rule are placid.
Vomiting, without being constant, is a frequent symptom, and in fatal
cases the f&aelig;ces and urine are passed involuntarily. There are occasional
deviations from this picture; tetanic strychnine-like convulsions have been
noticed and a condition of excitement in the non-fatal cases as if from
alcohol; in still rarer cases temporary mania has been produced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>In non-fatal but moderately severe cases of poisoning sequel&aelig; follow,
which in some respects imitate the sequel&aelig; seen on recovery from the infectious
fevers. A weakness of the understanding, incapacity for rational
and connected thought, and even insanity have been noticed. There is a
special liability to local inflammations, which may pass into gangrene.
Various paralyses have been observed. Eruptions of the skin, such as
herpes, pemphigus and others. Sugar in the urine is an almost constant
concomitant of carbon monoxide poisoning.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_39" id="Sect_39"></a>&sect; 39. The poisonous action of carbon monoxide is, without doubt, due
to the fact that it is readily absorbed by the blood, entering into a definite
chemical compound with the h&aelig;moglobin; this combination is more
stable than the similar compound with oxygen gas, and is therefore slow
in elimination.</p>

<p>Hence the blood of an animal remaining in an atmosphere containing
carbon monoxide is continually getting poorer in oxygen, richer in carbon
monoxide. Gr&eacute;hant has shown that if an animal breathes for one hour
a mixture of 0&middot;5 carbon monoxide to 1000 oxygen, the blood contains at
the end of that time one-third less oxygen than normal, and contains 152
times more carbon monoxide than in the mixture. An atmosphere of 10 per
cent. carbon monoxide changes the blood so quickly, that after from 10 to
25 seconds the blood contains 4 per cent. of carbon monoxide, and after
from 75 to 90 seconds 18&middot;4 per cent. Breathing even for half an hour
an atmosphere containing from 0&middot;07 to 0&middot;12 per cent. carbon monoxide
renders a fourth part of the red corpuscles of the blood incapable of
uniting with oxygen.</p>

<p>The blood is, however, never saturated with carbon monoxide, for the
animal dies long before this takes place.</p>

<p>The characteristics of the blood and its spectroscopic appearances are
described at <a href="#Page_58">p. 58</a>.</p>

<p>Besides the action on the blood there is an action on the nervous
system. Kobert,<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> in relation to this subject, says:&mdash;&#8220;That <span class="chemform">CO</span> has a
direct action on the nervous system is shown in a marked manner when
an atmosphere of oxygen, with at least 20 per cent. carbon oxide, is
breathed; for in the first minute there is acute cramp or total paralysis
of the limbs, when the blood in no way attains the saturation sufficiently
great to account for such symptoms. Geppert has, through a special
research, shown that an animal suffocated by withdrawal of oxygen,
increases the number and depth of the respirations; but when
the animal is submitted to <span class="chemform">CO</span>, in which case there is quite as much a
withdrawal of oxygen as in the former case, yet the animal is not in a
condition to strengthen its respiratory movements; Geppert hence rightly
concludes that <span class="chemform">CO</span> must have a primary specific injurious action on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
nerve centres.  I (Kobert) am inclined to go a step further, and, on the
ground of unpublished researches, to maintain that <span class="chemform">CO</span> not only affects
injuriously the ganglion cells of the brain, but also the peripheral nerves
(<i>e.g.</i>, the phrenic), as well as divers other tissues, as muscles and glands,
and that it causes so rapidly such a high degree of degeneration as not
to be explained through simple slow suffocation; even gangrene may be
caused.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>It is this rapid degeneration which is the cause of the enormous
increase of the products of the decomposition of albumin, found experimentally
in animals.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_40" id="Sect_40"></a>&sect; 40. <b>Post-mortem Appearances.</b>&mdash;The face, neck, chest, abdomen
are frequently covered with patches of irregular form and of clear rose-red
or bluish-red colour; these patches are not noticed on the back, and
thus do not depend upon the gravitation of the blood to the lower or
most dependent part of the body; similar red patches have been noticed
in poisoning by prussic acid; the cause of this phenomenon is ascribed
to the paralysis of the small arteries of the skin, which, therefore, become
injected with the changed blood.  The blood throughout is generally
fluid, and of a fine peculiar red colour, with a bluish tinge. The face is
mostly calm, pale, and there is seldom any foam about the lips.  Putrefaction
is mostly remarkably retarded.  There is nearly always a congestion
of some of the internal organs; sometimes, and indeed usually,
the membranes of the brain are strongly injected; sometimes the congestion
is mainly in the lungs, which may be &#339;dematous with effusion;
and in a third class of cases the congestion is most marked in the
abdominal cavity.</p>

<p>The right heart is commonly filled with blood, and the left side
contains only a little blood.</p>

<p>Poisoning by a small dose of carbon monoxide may produce but few
striking changes, and then it is only by a careful examination of the
blood that evidence of the real nature of the case will be obtained.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_41" id="Sect_41"></a>&sect; 41. <b>Mass poisonings by Carbon Monoxide.</b>&mdash;An interesting series
of cases of poisoning by water gas occurred at Leeds in 1889, and have
been recorded by Dr. Thos. Stevenson.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<div class="footnote">

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>Water gas is made by placing coke in a vertical cylinder and heating
the coke to a red heat.  Through the red-hot coke, air is forced up from
below for ten minutes; then the air is shut off and steam passes from
above downwards for four minutes; the gas passes through a scrubber, and
then through a ferric oxide purifier to remove <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>.  It contains about
50 per cent. of hydrogen and 40 per cent. of carbon monoxide, that is,
about five times more carbon monoxide than coal gas.</p>

<p>On November 20, 1889, two men, R. French and H. Fenwick, both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
intemperate men, occupied a cabin at the Leeds Forge Works; the
cabin was 540 c. feet in capacity, and was lighted by two burners, each
burning 5&middot;5 c. feet of water gas per hour; the cabin was warmed by a cooking
stove, also burning water gas, the products of combustion escaping into
the cabin. Both men went into the cabin after breakfast (8.30 <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span>).
French was seen often going to and fro, and Fenwick was seen outside
at 10.30 <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span> At 11.30 the foreman accompanied French to the cabin,
and found Fenwick asleep, as he thought. At 12.30 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span> French&#8217;s son
took the men their dinner, which was afterwards found uneaten. At
that time French also appeared to be asleep; he was shaken by his son,
upon which he nodded to his son to leave. The door of the cabin
appears to have been shut, and all through the morning the lights
kept burning; no smell was experienced. At 2.30 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span> both the men
were discovered dead. It was subsequently found that the stove was
unlighted, and the water gas supply turned on.</p>

<p>What attracted most attention to this case was the strange incident
at the <i>post-mortem</i> examination. The autopsies were begun two days after
the death, November 22, in a room of 39,000 c. feet capacity. There
were present Mr. T. Scattergood (senior), Mr. Arthur Scattergood (junior),
Mr. Hargreaves, three local surgeons, Messrs. Brown, Loe and Jessop, and
two assistants, Pugh and Spray. Arthur Scattergood first fainted, Mr.
Scattergood, senior, also had some peculiar sensations, viz., tingling in the
head and slight giddiness; then Mr. Pugh became faint and staggered;
and Mr. Loe, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Spray all complained.</p>

<p>These symptoms were not produced, as was at first thought, by some
volatile gas or vapour emanating from the bodies of the poisoned men,
but, as subsequently discovered, admitted of a very simple explanation;
eight burners in the room were turned partly on and not lighted, and
each of the eight burners poured water gas into the room.</p>

<p>In 1891 occurred some cases of poisoning<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> by <span class="chemform">CO</span> which are probably
unique. The cases in question happened in January in a family at
Darlaston. The first sign of anything unusual having happened to the
family most affected was the fact that up to 9 <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span>, Sunday morning,
January 18, none of the family had been seen about. The house was
broken into by the neighbours; and the father, mother, and three
children were found in bed apparently asleep, and all efforts to rouse
them utterly failed. The medical men summoned arrived about 10 <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span>
and found the father and mother in a state of complete unconsciousness,
and two of the children, aged 11 and 14 years, suffering from pain and
sickness and diarrh&#339;a; the third child had by this time been removed
to a neighbouring cottage.</p>

by Dr. George Reid, Medical Officer of Health, County of Stafford.
<i>Public Health</i>, vol. iii. 364.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Partridge, who was in attendance, remained with the patients three
hours, when he also began to suffer from headache; while others, who
remained in the house longer, suffered more severely and complained of
an indefinite feeling of exhaustion. These symptoms pointed to some
exciting cause associated with the surroundings of the cottage; consequently,
in the afternoon the two children were removed to another
cottage, and later on the father and mother also. All the patients, with
the exception of the mother, who was still four days afterwards suffering
from the effects of an acute attack, had completely recovered. The
opinion that the illness was owing to some local cause was subsequently
strengthened by the fact that two canaries and a cat had died in the
night in the kitchen of the cottage; the former in a cage and the latter
in a cupboard, the door of which was open. Also in the same house on
the opposite side of the road, the occupants of which had for some time
suffered from headache and depression, two birds were found dead in
their cage in the kitchen. It is important to notice that all these animals
died in the respective kitchens of the cottages, and, therefore, on the
ground floor, while the families occupied the first floor.</p>

<p>The father stated that for a fortnight or three weeks previous to the
serious illness, he and the whole family had complained of severe frontal
headache and a feeling of general depression. This feeling was continuous
day and night in the case of the rest of the family, but in his case,
during the day, after leaving the house for his work, it gradually passed
off, to return again during the night. The headaches were so intense
that the whole family regularly applied vinegar rags to their heads, on
going to bed each night during this period, for about three weeks.
About two o&#8217;clock on Sunday morning the headaches became so severe
that the mother got out of bed and renewed the application of vinegar
and water all round, after which they all fell asleep, and, so far as the
father and mother were concerned, remained completely unconscious
until Monday morning.</p>

<p>A man who occupied the house opposite the house tenanted by the
last-mentioned family informed the narrator (Dr. Reid) that on Sunday
morning the family, consisting of four, were taken seriously ill with a
feeling of sickness and depression accompanied by headache; and he
also stated that for some time they had smelt what he termed a &#8220;fire stink&#8221;
issuing from the cellar.</p>

<p>The cottage in which the family lived that had suffered so severely
was situated about 20 or 30 yards from the shaft of a disused coal mine,
and was the end house of a row of cottages. It had a cellar opening
into the outer air, but this opening was usually covered over by means of
a piece of wood. The adjoining house to this, the occupants of which
had for some time suffered from headache, although to a less extent, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
a cellar with a similar opening, but supplied with an ill-fitting cover.
The house on the opposite side of the road, in which the two birds were
found dead, had a cellar opening both at the front and the back; but
both these openings, until a little before the occurrence detailed, had
been kept closed. The cellars in all cases communicated with the houses
by means of doors opening into the kitchens. According to the general
account of the occupants, the cellars had smelled of &#8220;fire stink,&#8221; which,
in their opinion, proceeded from the adjoining mine.</p>

<p>The shaft of the disused mine communicated with a mine in working
order, and, to encourage the ventilation in this mine, a furnace had for
some weeks been lit and suspended in the shaft. This furnace had set
fire to the coal in the disused mine and smoke had been issuing from the
shaft for four weeks previously. Two days previous to the inquiry
the opening of the shaft had been closed over with a view to extinguish
the fire.</p>

<p>Dr. Reid considered, from the symptoms and all the circumstances of
the case, that the illness was due to carbon monoxide gas penetrating into
the cellars from the mine, and from thence to the living- and sleeping-rooms.
A sample of the air yielded 0&middot;015 per cent. of carbon monoxide,
although the sample had been taken after the cellar windows had been
open for twenty-four hours.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_42" id="Sect_42"></a>&sect; 42. <b>Detection of Carbon Monoxide.</b>&mdash;It may often be necessary to
detect carbon monoxide in air and to estimate its amount. The detection
in air, if the carbon monoxide is in any quantity, is easy enough; but
traces of carbon monoxide are difficult. Where amounts of carbon
monoxide in air from half a per cent. upwards are reasonably presumed to
exist, the air is measured in a gas measuring apparatus and passed into an
absorption pipette charged with alkaline pyrogallic acid, and when all the
oxygen has been abstracted, then the residual nitrogen and gases are
submitted to an ammoniacal solution of cuprous chloride.</p>

<p>The solution of cuprous chloride is prepared by dissolving 10&middot;3 grms.
of copper oxide in 150 c.c. of strong hydrochloric acid and filling the flask
with copper turnings; the copper reduces the cupric chloride to cuprous
chloride; the end of the reduction is known by the solution becoming
colourless. The colourless acid solution is poured into some 1500 c.c. of
water, and the cuprous chloride settles to the bottom as a precipitate.
The supernatant fluid is poured off as completely as possible and the
precipitate washed into a quarter litre flask, with 100 to 150 c.c. of distilled
water and ammonia led into the solution until it becomes of a pale
blue colour. The solution is made up to 200 c.c. so as to contain about
7&middot;3 grms. per cent. of cuprous chloride.</p>

<p>Such a solution is an absorbent of carbon monoxide; it also absorbs
ethylene and acetylene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>A solution of cuprous chloride which has absorbed <span class="chemform">CO</span> gives it up on
being treated with potassic bichromate and acid. It has been proposed
by Wanklyn to deprive large quantities of air of oxygen, then to absorb
any carbon monoxide present with cuprous chloride, and, lastly, to free
the cuprous chloride from the last gas by treatment with acid bichromate,
so as to be able to study the properties of a small quantity of pure gas.</p>

<p>By far the most reliable method to detect small quantities of carbon
monoxide is, however, as proposed by Hempel, to absorb it in the lungs
of a living animal.</p>

<p>A mouse is placed between two funnels joined together at their mouths
by a band of thin rubber; one of the ends of the double funnel is connected
with an aspirator, and the air thus sucked through, say for half an
hour or more; the mouse is then killed by drowning, and a control
mouse, which has not been exposed to a <span class="chemform">CO</span> atmosphere, is also drowned;
the bodies of both mice are cut in two in the region of the heart, and the
blood collected. Each sample of blood is diluted in the same proportion
and spectroscopically examined in the manner detailed at <a href="#Page_58">p. 58</a>.</p>

<p>Winkler found that, when large volumes of gas were used (at least 10
litres), 0&middot;05 per cent. of carbon monoxide could be readily detected.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h3>II.&mdash;Chlorine.</h3>

<p><a name="Sect_43" id="Sect_43"></a>&sect; 43. Chlorine is a yellow-green gas, which may, by cold and pressure,
be condensed into a liquid. Its specific gravity is, as compared with
hydrogen, 35&middot;37; as compared with air, 2&middot;45; a litre under standard
conditions weighs 3&middot;167 grms. It is soluble in water.</p>

<p>The usual method of preparation is the addition of hydrochloric acid
to bleaching powder, which latter substance is hypochlorite of lime mixed
with calcic chloride and, it may be, a little caustic lime. Another
method is to treat manganese dioxide with hydrochloric acid or to act on
manganese dioxide and common salt with sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>Accidents are liable to occur with chlorine gas from its extensive use
as a disinfectant and also in its manufacture. In the &#8220;Weldon&#8221; process
of manufacturing bleaching powder, a thick layer of lime is placed on
the floor of special chambers; chlorine gas is passed into these chambers
for about four days; then the gas is turned off; the unabsorbed gas is
drawn off by an exhaust or absorbed by a lime distributor and the doors
opened. Two hours afterwards the men go in to pack the powder. The
packers, in order to be able to work in the chambers, wear a respirator consisting
of about thirty folds of damp flannel; this is tightly bound round
the mouth with the nostrils free and resting upon it. The men are
obliged to inhale the breath through the flannel and exhale through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
nostril, otherwise they would, in technical jargon, be &#8220;gassed.&#8221;  Some
also wear goggles to protect their eyes.  Notwithstanding these precautions
they suffer generally from chest complaints.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_44" id="Sect_44"></a>&sect; 44. <b>Effects.</b>&mdash;Free chlorine, in the proportion of 0&middot;04 to 0&middot;06 per
thousand, taken into the lungs is dangerous to life, since directly
chlorine attacks a moist mucous membrane, hydrochloric acid is formed.
The effects of chlorine can hardly be differentiated from hydrochloric acid
gas, and Lehmann found that 1&middot;5 per thousand of this latter gas affected
animals, causing at once uneasiness, evidence of pain with great dyspn&#339;a,
and later coma.  The eyes and the mucous membrane of the nose were
attacked.  Anatomical changes took place in the cornea, as evidenced by
a white opacity.</p>

<p>In cases that recovered, a purulent discharge came from the nostrils
with occasional necrosis of the mucous membrane.  The symptoms in man
are similar; there is great tightness of the breath, irritation of the nose
and eyes, cough and, with small repeated doses, bronchitis with all its
attendant evils.  Bleaching powder taken by the mouth is not so deadly.
Hertwig has given 1000 grms. to horses, 30 grms. to sheep and goats, and
15 grms. to dogs without producing death.  The symptoms in these cases
were quickening of the pulse and respiration, increased peristaltic action
of the bowels and a stimulation of the kidney secretion. The urine
smelt of chlorine.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_45" id="Sect_45"></a>&sect; 45. <b>Post-mortem Appearances.</b>&mdash;Hyper&aelig;mia of the lungs, with
ecchymoses and pneumonic patches with increased secretion of the
bronchial tubes.  In the mucous membrane of the stomach, ecchymoses.
The alkalescence of the blood is diminished and there may be external
signs of bleaching.  Only exceptionally has any chlorine smell been
perceived in the internal organs.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_46" id="Sect_46"></a>&sect; 46. <b>Detection of Free Chlorine.</b>&mdash;The usual method of detection is
to prepare a solution of iodide of potassium and starch and to soak strips
of filter-paper in this solution.  Such a strip, when moistened and submitted
to a chlorine atmosphere, is at once turned blue, because chlorine
displaces iodine from its combination with potassium.  Litmus-paper,
indigo blue or other vegetable colours are at once bleached.</p>

<p>To estimate the amount of chlorine a known volume of the air is
drawn through a solution of potassium iodide, and the amount of iodine
set free, determined by titration with sodic hyposulphite, as detailed at
<a href="#Page_74">p. 74</a>.</p>

<h3>III.&mdash;Hydric Sulphide (Sulphuretted Hydrogen).</h3>

<p><a name="Sect_47" id="Sect_47"></a>&sect; 47. Hydric sulphide, <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>, is a colourless transparent gas of sp. gravity
1&middot;178.  It burns with a blue flame, forming water and sulphur dioxide,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and is soluble in water; water absorbing about three volumes at ordinary
temperatures.  It is decomposed by either chlorine gas or sulphur
dioxide.</p>

<p>It is a common gas as a constituent of the air of sewers or cesspools,
and emanates from moist slag or moist earth containing pyrites or metallic
sulphides; it also occurs whenever albuminous matter putrefies; hence
it is a common constituent of the emanations from corpses of either man
or animals.  It has a peculiar and intense odour, generally compared to
that of rotten eggs; this is really not a good comparison, for it is comparing
the gas with itself, rotten eggs always producing <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>; it is
often associated with ammonium sulphide.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_48" id="Sect_48"></a>&sect; 48. <b>Effects.</b>&mdash;Pure hydric sulphide is never met with out of the
chemist&#8217;s laboratory, in which it is a common reagent either as a gas or
in solution; so that the few cases of poisoning by the pure gas, or rather
the pure gas mixed with ordinary air, have been confined to laboratories.</p>

<p>The greater number of cases have occurred accidentally to men working
in sewers, or cleaning out cesspools and the like.  In small quantities
it is always present in the air of towns, as shown by the blackening of any
silver ornament not kept bright by frequent use.</p>

<p>It is distinctly a blood poison, the gas uniting with the alkali of the
blood, and the sulphide thus produced partly decomposing again in the
lung and breathed out as <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>.  Lehmann<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> has studied the effects on
animals; an atmosphere containing from 1 to 3 per thousand of <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>
kills rabbits and cats within ten minutes; the symptoms are mainly
convulsions and great dyspn&#339;a.  An atmosphere containing from 0&middot;4 to
0&middot;8 per thousand produces a local irritating action on the mucous membranes
of the respiratory tract, and death follows from an inflammatory
&#339;dema of the lung preceded by convulsions; there is also a paralysis of
the nervous centres. Lehmann has recorded the case of three men who
breathed 0&middot;2 per thousand of <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>: within from five to eight minutes there
was intense irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, and after thirty
minutes they were unable to bear the atmosphere any longer. Air containing
0&middot;5 per thousand of <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span> is, according to Lehmann, the utmost
amount that can be breathed; this amount causes in half an hour smarting
of the eyes, nasal catarrh, dyspn&#339;a, cough, palpitation, shivering,
great muscular weakness, headache and faintness with cold sweats. 0&middot;7
to 0&middot;8 per thousand is dangerous to human life, and from 1 to 1&middot;5 per
thousand destroys life rapidly.  The symptoms may occur some little
time after the withdrawal of the person from the poisonous atmosphere;
for example, Cahn records the case of a student who prepared <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span> in
a laboratory and was exposed to the gas for two hours; he then went
home to dinner and the symptoms first commenced in more than an hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
after the first breathing of pure air.  Taylor<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> records an unusual case of
poisoning in 1857 at Cleator Moor.  Some cottages had been built upon
iron slag, the slag contained sulphides of calcium and iron; a heavy
storm of rain washed through the slag and considerable volumes of <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>
with, no doubt, other gases diffused during the night through the cottages
and killed three adults and three children.</p>

<span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span> poisoning, in which the sufferer dies within a minute or two, shows
no special change.  The most frequent change in slower poisoning is,
according to Lehmann, &#339;dema of the lungs. A green colour of the face
and of the whole body is sometimes present, but not constant.  A spectroscopic
examination of the blood may also not lead to any conclusion, the
more especially as the spectrum of sulphur meth&aelig;moglobin may occur in
any putrid blood.  The pupils in some cases have been found dilated;
in others not so.</p>

<p><b>Chronic poisoning.</b>&mdash;Chronic poisoning by SH<sub>2</sub> is of considerable
interest in a public health point of view.  The symptoms appear to be
conjunctivitis, headache, dyspepsia and an&aelig;mia. A predisposition to
boils has also been noted.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_50" id="Sect_50"></a>&sect; 50. <b>Detection.</b>&mdash;Both ammonium and hydric sulphides blacken
silver and filter-paper moistened with acetate of lead solution.  To test
for hydric sulphide in air a known quantity may be aspirated through a
little solution of lead acetate.  To estimate the quantity a decinormal
solution of iodine in potassium iodide<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> solution is used, and its exact
strength determined by d.n. sodic hyposulphite solution<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>; the hyposulphite
is run in from a burette into a known volume, <i>e.g.</i>, 50 c.c., of the
d.n. iodine solution, until the yellow colour is almost gone; then a drop
or two of fresh starch solution is added and the hyposulphite run in
carefully, drop by drop, until the blue colour of the starch disappears.
If now a known volume of air is drawn through 50 c.c. of the d.n. iodine
solution, the reaction <span class="chemform">I<sub>2</sub></span> + <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span> = <span class="chemform">2HI</span> + S will take place, and for every
127 parts of iodine which have been converted into hydriodic acid 17
parts by weight of <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span> will be necessary; hence on titrating the 50 c.c.
of d.n. iodine solution, through which air containing <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span> has been passed,
less hyposulphite will be used than on the previous occasion, each c.c.
of the hyposulphite solution being equal to 1&middot;11 c.c. or to 1&middot;7 mgrm.
of <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h3>I.&mdash;Sulphuric Acid.</h3>

<p><a name="Sect_51" id="Sect_51"></a>&sect; 51. Sulphuric acid (hydric sulphate, oil of vitriol, <span class="chemform">H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub></span>) occurs in
commerce in varying degrees of strength or dilution; the strong sulphuric
acid of the manufacturer, containing 100 per cent. of real acid
(<span class="chemform">H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub></span>), has a specific gravity of 1&middot;850. The ordinary brown acid of
commerce, coloured by organic matter and holding in solution metallic
impurities, chiefly lead and arsenic, has a specific gravity of about 1&middot;750;
and contains 67&middot;95 of anhydrous <span class="chemform">SO<sub>3</sub></span> = 85&middot;42 of hydric sulphate.</p>

<p>There are also weaker acids used in commerce, particularly in manufactories
in which sulphuric acid is made, for special purposes without
rectification. The British Pharmacop&#339;ia sulphuric acid is directed to be
of 1&middot;843 specific gravity, which corresponds to 78&middot;6 per cent. sulphuric
anhydride, or 98&middot;8 per cent. of hydric sulphate. The dilute sulphuric
acid of the pharmacop&#339;ia should have a specific gravity of 1&middot;094, and is
usually said to correspond to 10&middot;14 per cent. of anhydrous sulphuric acid;
but, if Ure&#8217;s Tables are correct, such equals 11&middot;37 per cent.</p>

<p>The general characters of sulphuric acid are as follows:&mdash;When pure,
it is a colourless, or, when impure, a dark brown to black, oily liquid,
without odour at common temperatures, of an exceedingly acid taste,
charring most organic tissues rapidly, and, if mixed with water, evolving
much heat. If 4 parts of the strong acid are mixed with 1 part of water
at 0&deg;, the mixture rises to a heat of 100&deg;; a still greater heat is evolved
by mixing 75 parts of acid with 27 of water.</p>

<p>Sulphuric acid is powerfully hygroscopic&mdash;3 parts will, in an ordinary
atmosphere, increase to nearly 4 in twenty-four hours; in common with
all acids, it reddens litmus, yellows cochineal, and changes all vegetable
colours. There is another form of sulphuric acid, extensively used in the
arts, known under the name of &#8220;Nordhausen sulphuric acid,&#8221; &#8220;fuming
acid,&#8221; formula <span class="chemform">H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub></span>. This acid is produced by the distillation of dry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
ferrous sulphate, at a nearly white heat&mdash;either in earthenware or in
green glass retorts; the distillate is received in sulphuric acid. As thus
manufactured, it is a dark fuming liquid of 1&middot;9 specific gravity, and boiling
at 53&deg;. When artificially cooled down to 0&deg;, the acid gradually
deposits crystals, which consist of a definite compound of 2 atoms of
anhydrous sulphuric acid and 1 atom of water. There is some doubt as
to the molecular composition of Nordhausen acid; it is usually considered
as hydric sulphate saturated with sulphur dioxide. This acid is manufactured
chiefly in Bohemia, and is used, on a large scale, as a solvent for
alizarine.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_52" id="Sect_52"></a>&sect; 52. <b>Sulphur Trioxide, or Sulphuric Anhydride</b> (<span class="chemform">SO<sub>3</sub></span>), itself may
be met with in scientific laboratories, but is not in commerce. Sulphur
trioxide forms thin needle-shaped crystals, arranged in feathery groups.
Seen in mass, it is white, and has something the appearance of asbestos.
It fuses to a liquid at about 18&deg;, boils at 35&deg;, but, after this operation has
been performed, the substance assumes an allotropic condition, and then
remains solid up to 100&deg;; above 100&deg; it melts, volatilises, and returns to
its normal condition. Sulphuric anhydride hisses when it is thrown into
water, chemical combination taking place and sulphuric acid being formed.
Sulphur trioxide is excessively corrosive and poisonous.</p>

<p>Besides the above forms of acid, there is an officinal preparation called
&#8220;Aromatic Sulphuric Acid,&#8221; made by digesting sulphuric acid, rectified
spirit, ginger, and cinnamon together. It contains 10&middot;19 per cent. of
<span class="chemform">SO<sub>3</sub></span>, alcohol, and principles extracted from cinnamon and ginger.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_53" id="Sect_53"></a>&sect; 53. Sulphuric acid, in the free state, may not unfrequently be found
in nature. The author has had under examination an effluent water from
a Devonshire mine, which contained more than one grain of free sulphuric
acid per gallon, and was accused, with justice, of destroying the
fish in a river. It also exists in large quantities in volcanic springs. In
a torrent flowing from the volcano of Parc&eacute;, in the Andes, Boussingault
calculated that 15,000 tons of sulphuric acid and 11,000 tons of hydrochloric
acid were yearly carried down. In the animal and vegetable
kingdom, sulphuric acid exists, as a rule, in combination with bases, but
there is an exception in the saliva of the <i>Dolium galea</i>, a Sicilian mollusc.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_54" id="Sect_54"></a>&sect; 54. <b>Statistics.</b>&mdash;When something like 900,000 tons of sulphuric
acid are produced annually in England alone, and when it is considered
that sulphuric acid is used in the manufacture of most other acids, in the
alkali trade, in the manufacture of indigo, in the soap trade, in the manufacture
of artificial manure, and in a number of technical processes, there
is no cause for surprise that it should be the annual cause of many
deaths.</p>

<p>The number of deaths from sulphuric acid will vary, other things being
equal, in each country, according to the manufactures in that country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
employing sulphuric acid. The number of cases of poisoning in England
and Wales for ten years is given in the following table:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>During the ten years, no case of murder through sulphuric acid is on
record; hence the total deaths, as detailed in the tables, amount to 95, or
a little over 9 a year.</p>

<p>Falck,<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> in comparing different countries, considers the past statistics
to show that in France sulphuric acid has been the cause of 4&middot;5 to 5&middot;5
per cent. of the total deaths from poison, and in England 5&middot;9 per cent.
In England, France, and Denmark, taken together, 10&middot;8, Prussia 10&middot;6;
while in certain cities, as Berlin and Vienna, the percentages are much
higher&mdash;Vienna showing 43&middot;3 per cent., Berlin 90 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_55" id="Sect_55"></a>&sect; 55. <b>Accidental, Suicidal, and Criminal Poisoning.</b>&mdash;Deaths from
sulphuric acid are, for the most part, accidental, occasionally suicidal, and,
still more rarely, criminal. In 53 out of 113 cases collected by B&ouml;hm,
in which the cause of the poisoning could, with fair accuracy, be
ascertained, 45&middot;3 per cent. were due to accident, 30&middot;2 were suicidal,
and 24&middot;5 per cent. were cases of criminal poisoning, the victims being
children.</p>

<p>The cause of the comparatively rare use of sulphuric acid by the
poisoner is obvious. First of all, the acid can never be mixed with food
without entirely changing its aspect; next, it is only in cases of
insensibility or paralysis that it could be administered to an adult,
unless given by force, or under very exceptional circumstances; and
lastly, the stains on the mouth and garments would at once betray, even
to uneducated persons, the presence of something wrong. As an agent
of murder, then, sulphuric acid is confined in its use to young children,
more especially to the newly born.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a remarkable case related by Haagan,<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> in which an adult
man, in full possession of his faculties, neither paralysed nor helpless,
was murdered by sulphuric acid. The wife of a day-labourer gave her
husband drops of sulphuric acid on sugar, instead of his medicine, and
finally finished the work by administering a spoonful of the acid. The
spoon was carried well to the back of the throat, so that the man took
the acid at a gulp. 11 grms. (171 grains) of sulphuric acid, partly in
combination with soda and potash, were separated from his stomach.</p>

<p>Accidental poisoning is most common among children. The oily,
syrupy-looking sulphuric acid, when pure, may be mistaken for glycerin
or for syrup; and the dark commercial acid might, by a careless person,
be confounded with porter or any dark-looking medicine.</p>

<p>Serious and fatal mistakes have not unfrequently arisen from the use
of injections. Deutsch<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> relates how a midwife, in error, administered to
mother and child a sulphuric acid clyster; but little of the fluid could in
either case have actually reached the rectum, for the mother recovered in
eight days, and in a little time the infant was also restored to health.
Sulphuric acid has caused death by injections into the vagina. H. C.
Lombard<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> observed a case of this kind, in which a woman, aged thirty,
injected half a litre of sulphuric acid into the vagina, for the purpose of
procuring abortion. The result was not immediately fatal, but the subsequent
inflammation and its results so occluded the natural passage that
the birth became impossible, and a C&aelig;sarean section extracted a dead
child, the mother also dying.</p>

<p>An army physician prescribed for a patient an emollient clyster.
Since it was late at night, and the apothecary in bed, he prepared it
himself; but not finding linseed oil, woke the apothecary, who took a
bottle out of one of the recesses and placed it on the table. The bottle
contained sulphuric acid; a soldier noticed a peculiar odour and effervescence
when the syringe was charged, but this was unheeded by the
doctor. The patient immediately after the operation suffered the most
acute agony, and died the following day; before his death, the bedclothes
were found corroded by the acid, and a portion of the bowel itself

<p><a name="Sect_56" id="Sect_56"></a>&sect; 56. <b>Fatal Dose.</b>&mdash;The amount necessary to kill an adult man is not
strictly known; fatality so much depends on the concentration of the
acid and the condition of the person, more especially whether the stomach
is full or empty, that it will be impossible ever to arrive at an accurate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
estimate. Christison&#8217;s case, in which 3&middot;8 grms. (60 grains) of concentrated
acid killed an adult, is the smallest lethal dose on record.
Supposing that the man weighed 68<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> kilo. (150 lbs.), this would be in the
proportion of &middot;05 grm. per kilo. There is also the case of a child of
one year, recorded by Taylor, in which 20 drops caused death. If,
however, it were asked in a court of law what dose of concentrated
sulphuric acid would be dangerous, the proper answer would be: so
small a quantity as from 2 to 3 drops of the strong undiluted acid might
cause death, more especially if conveyed to the back of the throat; for
if it is improbable that on such a supposition death would be sudden, yet
there is a possibility of permanent injury to the gullet, with the result of
subsequent contraction, and the usual long and painful malnutrition
thereby induced. It may be laid down, therefore, that all quantities,
even the smallest, of the <i>strong undiluted acid</i> come under the head of
hurtful, noxious, and injurious.</p>

Vietor.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Concentrated acid precipitates albumen, and then redissolves
it; fibrin swells and becomes gelatinous; but if the acid is weak (<i>e.g.</i>,
4 to 6 per cent.) it is scarcely changed. Muscular fibre is at first
coloured amber-yellow, swells to a jelly, and then dissolves to a red-brown
turbid fluid. When applied to the mucous membrane of the stomach,
the mucous tissue and the muscular layer beneath are coloured white,
swell, and become an oily mass.</p>

drop, with horizontal holding of the ear, is dried in, an inflammatory zone
surrounds the burnt spot in which the blood circulates; but there is
complete stasis in the part to which the acid has been applied. If the
point of the ear is dipped in the acid, the cauterised part rolls inwards;
after the lapse of eighteen hours the part is brown and parchment-like,
with scattered points of coagulated blood; then there is a slight swelling
in the healthy tissues, and a small zone of redness; within fourteen
days a bladder-like greenish-yellow scab is formed, the burnt part itself
remaining dry. The vessels from the surrounding zone of redness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
gradually penetrate towards the cauterised spot, the fluid in the bleb
becomes absorbed, and the destroyed tissues fall off in the form of a
crust.</p>

<p>The changes that sulphuric acid cause in blood are as follows: the
fibrin is at first coagulated and then dissolved, and the colouring matter
becomes of a black colour. These changes do not require the strongest
acid, being seen with an acid of 60 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_58" id="Sect_58"></a>&sect; 58. The action of the acid on various non-living matters is as
follows: poured on all vegetable earth, there is an effervescence, arising
from decomposition of carbonates; any grass or vegetation growing on
the spot is blackened and dies; an analysis of the layer of earth, on
which the acid is poured, shows an excess of sulphates as compared with
a similar layer adjacent; the earth will only have an acid reaction, if
there has been more than sufficient acid to neutralise all alkalies and
alkaline earths.</p>

<p>Wood almost immediately blackens, and the spot remains moist.</p>

<p>Spots on paper become quickly dark, and sometimes exhibit a play of
colours, such as reddish-brown; ultimately the spot becomes very black,
and holes may be formed; even when the acid is dilute, the course is
very similar, for the acid dries in, until it reaches a sufficient degree of
concentration to attack the tissue. I found small drops of sulphuric
acid on a brussels carpet, which had a red pattern on a dark green
ground with light green flowers, act as follows: the spots on the red
at the end of a few hours were of a dark maroon colour, the green
was darkened, and the light green browned; at the end of twenty-four
hours but little change had taken place, nor could any one have guessed
the cause of the spots without a close examination. Spots of the
strong acid on thin cotton fabrics rapidly blackened, and actual holes
were formed in the course of an hour; the main difference to the
naked eye, between the stains of the acid and those produced by a
red-hot body, lay in the moistness of the spots. Indeed, the great
distinction, without considering chemical evidence, between recent burns
of clothing by sulphuric acid and by heat, is that in the one case&mdash;that
of the acid&mdash;the hole or spot is very moist; in the other very
dry. It is easy to imagine that this distinction may be of importance
in a legal investigation.</p>

<p>Spots of acid on clothing fall too often under the observation of all
those engaged in practical chemical work. However quickly a spot of
acid is wiped off, unless it is immediately neutralised by ammonia, it
ultimately makes a hole in the cloth; the spot, as a rule, whatever the
colour of the cloth, is of a blotting-paper red.</p>

<p>Sulphuric acid dropped on iron, attacks it, forming a sulphate, which
may be dissolved out by water. If the iron is exposed to the weather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the rain may wash away all traces of the acid, save the corrosion; but
it would be under those circumstances impossible to say whether the
corrosion was due to oxidation or a solvent.</p>

<p>To sum up briefly: the characters of sulphuric acid spots on organic
matters generally are black, brown, or red-coloured destructions of tissue,
moisture, acid-reaction (often after years), and lastly the chemical evidence
of sulphuric acid or sulphates in excess.</p>

<p><b>Caution necessary in judging of Spots, &amp;c.</b>&mdash;An important case, related
by Maschka, shows the necessity of great caution in interpreting results,
unless all the circumstances of a case be carefully collated. A live coal
fell on the bed of a weakly infant, five months old. The child screamed,
and woke the father, who was dozing by the fire; the man, in terror,
poured a large pot of water on the child and burning bed. The child
died the following day.</p>

<p>A <i>post-mortem</i> examination showed a burn on the chest of the infant
2 inches in length. The tongue, pharynx, and gullet were all healthy;
in the stomach a patch of mucous membrane, about half an inch in extent,
was found to be brownish, friable, and very thin. A chemical examination
showed that the portion of the bed adjacent to the burnt place contained
free sulphuric acid. Here, then, was the following evidence:
the sudden death of a helpless infant, a carbonised bed-cover with free
sulphuric acid, and, lastly, an appearance in the stomach which, it might
be said, was not inconsistent with sulphuric acid poisoning. Yet a careful
sifting of the facts convinced the judges that no crime had been committed,
and that the child&#8217;s death was due to disease. Afterwards,
experiment showed that if a live coal fall on to any tissue, and be
drenched with water, free sulphuric acid is constantly found in the
neighbourhood of the burnt place.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_59" id="Sect_59"></a>&sect; 59. <b>Symptoms.</b>&mdash;The symptoms may be classed in two divisions,
viz.:&mdash;1. External effects of the acid. 2. Internal effects and symptoms
arising from its interior administration.</p>

<p>1. <b>External Effects.</b>&mdash;Of late years several instances have occurred in
which the acid has been used criminally to cause disfiguring burns of the
face. The offence has in all these cases been committed by women, who,
from motives of revengeful jealousy, have suddenly dashed a quantity of
the acid into the face of the object of their resentment. In such cases,
the phenomena observed are not widely different from those attending
scalds or burns from hot neutral fluids. There is destruction of tissue,
not necessarily deep, for the acid is almost immediately wiped off; but
if any should reach the eye, inflammation, so acute as to lead to blindness,
is the probable consequence. The skin is coloured at first white,
at a later period brown, and part of it may be, as it were, dissolved. If
the tract or skin touched by the acid is extensive, death may result. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
inflammatory processes in the skin are similar to those noticed by Falck
and Vietor in their experiments, already detailed (<a href="#Page_79">p. 79</a>).</p>

<p><b>Internal Effects of Acids generally.</b>&mdash;It may not be out of place,
before speaking of the internal effects of sulphuric acid, to make a few
remarks upon the action of acids generally.  This action differs according
to the kind of animal; at all events, there is a great difference between
the action of acids on the herb-eating animals and the carnivora; the latter
bear large doses of acids well, the former ill.  For instance, the rabbit, if
given a dose of any acid not sufficient to produce local effects but sufficient
to affect its functions, will soon become paralysed and lie in a state
of stupor, as if dead; the same dose per kilo. will not affect the dog.
The reason for this is that the blood of the dog is able to neutralise the
acid by ammonia, and that the blood of the rabbit is destitute of this
property.  Man is, in this respect, nearer to the dog than to the plant-eaters.
Stadelmann has shown that a man is able to ingest large relative
doses of oxybutyric acid, to neutralise the acid by ammonia, and to
excrete it by means of the kidneys as ammonium butyrate.</p>

<p>Acids, however, if given in doses too great to be neutralised, alike
affect plant- and flesh-eaters; death follows in all cases before the blood
becomes acid.  Salkowsky<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> has, indeed, shown that the effect of lessening
the alkalinity of the blood by giving a rabbit food from which it can
extract no alkali produces a similar effect to the actual dosing with an
acid.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>2. <b>Internal Effects of Sulphuric Acid.</b>&mdash;When sulphuric acid is
taken internally, the acute and immediate symptom is pain.  This, however,
is not constant, since, in a few recorded cases, no complaint of pain
has been made; but these cases are exceptional; as a rule, there will be
immediate and great suffering.  The tongue swells, the throat is also
swollen and inflamed, swallowing of saliva even may be impossible. If
the acid has been in contact with the epiglottis and vocal apparatus,
there may be spasmodic croup and even fatal spasm of the glottis.</p>

<p>The acid, in its passage down the gullet, attacks energetically the
mucous membrane and also the lining of the stomach; but the action does
not stop there, for Lesser found in eighteen out of twenty-six cases (69 per
cent.) that the corrosive action extended as far as the duodenum. There is
excessive vomiting and retching; the matters vomited are acid, bloody, and
slimy; great pieces of mucous membrane may be in this way expelled, and
the whole of the lining membrane of the gullet may be thrown up entire.
The bowels are, as a rule, constipated, but exceptionally there has been
diarrh&#339;a; the urine is sometimes retained; it invariably contains an excess
of sulphates and often albumen, with hyaline casts of the uriniferous
tubes.  The pulse is small and frequent, the breathing slow, the skin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
very cold and covered with sweat; the countenance expresses great
anxiety, and the extremities may be affected with cramps or convulsions.
Death may take place within from twenty-four to thirty-six hours,
and be either preceded by dyspn&#339;a or by convulsions; consciousness is,
as a rule, maintained to the end.</p>

<p>There are also more rapid cases than the above; a large dose of sulphuric
acid taken on an empty stomach may absolutely dissolve it, and
pass into the peritoneum; in such a case there is really no difference in
the symptoms between sudden perforation of the stomach from disease,
a penetrating wound of the abdomen, and any other sudden fatal lesion
of the organs in the abdominal cavity (for in all these instances the
symptoms are those of pure collapse); the patient is ashen pale, with
pulse quick and weak, and body bathed in cold sweat, and he rapidly
dies, it may be without much complaint of local pain.</p>

<p>If the patient live longer than twenty-four hours, the symptoms are
mainly those of inflammation of the whole mucous tract, from the mouth to
the stomach; and from this inflammation the patient may die in a variable
period, of from three to eleven days, after taking the poison.  In one case
the death occurred suddenly, without any immediately preceding symptoms
rendering imminent death probable.  If this second stage is passed,
then the loss of substance in the gullet and in the stomach almost
invariably causes impairment of function, leading to a slow and painful
death.  The common sequence is stricture of the gullet, combined with
feeble digestion, and in a few instances stricture of the pylorus.  A
curious sequel has been recorded by Mannkopf, viz., obstinate intercostal
neuralgia; it has been observed on the fourth, seventh, and twenty-second
day.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_60" id="Sect_60"></a>&sect; 60. <b>Treatment of Acute Poisoning by the Mineral Acids.</b>&mdash;The
immediate indication is the dilution and neutralisation of the acid. For
this purpose, finely-divided chalk, magnesia, or sodic carbonate may be
used, dissolved or suspended in much water.  The use of the stomach-pump
is inadvisable, for the mucous membrane of the gullet may be so
corroded by the acid that the passage of the tube down will do injury;
unless the neutralisation is <i>immediate</i>, but little good is effected; hence
it will often occur that the bystanders, if at all conversant with the
matter, will have to use the first thing which comes to hand, such as the
plaster of a wall, &amp;c.; and lastly, if even these rough antidotes are not to
be had, the best treatment is enormous doses of water, which will dilute
the acid and promote vomiting. The treatment of the after-effects
belongs to the province of ordinary medicine, and is based upon general
principles.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_61" id="Sect_61"></a>&sect; 61. <b>Post-mortem Appearances.</b><a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>&mdash;The general pathological appearances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
to be found in the stomach and internal organs differ according as
the death is rapid or slow; if the death takes place within twenty-four
hours, the effects are fairly uniform, the differences being only in degree;
while, on the other hand, in those cases which terminate fatally from the
more remote effects of the acid, there is some variety.  It may be well to
select two actual cases as types, the one patient dying from acute poisoning,
the other surviving for a time, and then dying from ulceration and
contraction of the digestive tract.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_72" id="Footnote_72"></a><a href="#FNanchor_72"><span class="label">[72]</span></a> It has been observed that putrefaction in cases of death from
sulphuric acid is slow. Casper suggests this may be due to the
neutralisation of ammonia; more probably it is owing to the antiseptic
properties all mineral acids possess.</p>

<p>A hatter, early in the morning, swallowed a large mouthful of strong
sulphuric acid, a preparation which he used in his work&mdash;(whether the
draught was taken accidentally or suicidally was never known).  He died
within two hours.  The whole tongue was sphacelated, parts of the
mucous membrane being dissolved; the inner surface of the gullet, as
well as the whole throat, was of a grey-black colour; the mucous membrane
of the stomach was coal-black, and so softened that it gave way
like blotting-paper under the forceps, the contents escaping into the
cavity of the abdomen.  The peritoneum was also blackened as if burnt;
probably there had been perforation of the stomach during life; the
mucous membrane of the duodenum was swollen, hardened, and looked
as if it had been boiled; while the blood was of a cherry-red colour, and
of the consistence of a thin syrup. The rest of the organs were healthy;
a chemical research on the fluid which had been collected from the
stomach, gullet, and duodenum showed that it contained 87&middot;25 grains of
free sulphuric acid.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>This is, perhaps, the most extreme case of destruction on record; the
cause of the unusually violent action is referable to the acid acting on an
empty stomach.  It is important to note that even with this extensive
destruction of the stomach, life was prolonged for two hours.</p>

<p>The case I have selected to serve as a type of a chronic but fatal illness
produced from poisoning by sulphuric acid is one related by Oscar Wyss.
A cook, thirty-four years of age, who had suffered many ailments, drank,
on the 6th of November 1867, by mistake, at eight o&#8217;clock in the morning,
two mouthfuls of a mixture of 1 part of sulphuric acid and 4 of
water.  Pain in the stomach and neck, and vomiting of black masses,
were the immediate symptoms, and two hours later he was admitted into
the hospital in a state of collapse, with cold extremities, cyanosis of the
face, &amp;c.  Copious draughts of milk were given, and the patient vomited
much, the vomit still consisting of black pultaceous matters, in which, on
a microscopical examination, could be readily detected columnar epithelium
of the stomach and mucous tissue elements.  The urine was of specific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
gravity 1&middot;033, non-albuminous; on analysis it contained 3&middot;388 grms. of
combined sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>On the second day there was some improvement in the symptoms;
the urine contained 1&middot;276 grm. of combined sulphuric acid; on the third
day 2&middot;665 grms. of combined sulphuric acid; and on the tenth day the
patient vomited up a complete cast of the mucous membrane of the
gullet.  The patient remained in the hospital, and became gradually
weaker from stricture of the gullet and impairment of the digestive
powers, and died, two months after taking the poison, on the 5th of
January 1868.</p>

<p>The stomach was found small, contracted, with many adhesions to the
pancreas and liver; it was about 12 centimetres long (4&middot;7 inches), and
from 2 to 2&middot;5 centimetres (&middot;7 to &middot;9 inch) broad, contracted to somewhat the
form of a cat&#8217;s intestine; there were several transverse rug&aelig;; the walls
were thickened at the small curvature, measurements giving 5 mm.
(&middot;19 inch) in the middle, and beyond about 2&middot;75 mm. (&middot;11 inch); in the
upper two-thirds the lumen was so contracted as scarcely to admit the
point of the little finger.  The inner surface was covered with a layer of
pus, with no trace of mucous tissue, and was everywhere pale red,
uneven, and crossed by cicatricial bands.  In two parts, at the greater
curvature, the mucous surface was strongly injected in a ring-like form,
and in the middle of the ring was a deep funnel-shaped ulcer; a part of
the rest of the stomach was strongly injected and scattered over with
numerous punctiform, small, transparent bladders.  The gullet was contracted
at the upper part (just below the epiglottis) from 20 to 22 mm.
(&middot;78 to &middot;86 inch) in diameter; it then gradually widened to measure
about 12 mm. (&middot;47 inch) at the diaphragm; in the neighbourhood of the
last contraction the tissue was scarred, injected, and ulcerated; there
were also small abscesses opening into this portion of the gullet.</p>

<p>E. Fraenkel and F. Reiche<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> have studied the effects of sulphuric acid
on the kidney.  In rapid cases they find a wide-spread coagulation of the
epithelium in the convoluted and straight urinary canaliculi, with destruction
of the kidney parenchyma, but no inflammation.</p>

material for the study of the effects of sulphuric acid on the pharynx,
gullet, and stomach; and it may be a matter of convenience to students
if the more typical examples at these different museums be noticed in
detail, so that the preparations themselves may be referred to.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>In St. Bartholomew&#8217;s Museum</i>, No. 1942, is an example of excessive destruction of

present time; but the rough, shaggy state of the mucous tissue can be traced; the
gullet and the pylorus appear the least affected.</p>

<h4>Detection and Estimation of Free Sulphuric Acid.</h4>

<p><a name="Sect_64" id="Sect_64"></a>&sect; 64. The general method of separating the mineral acids is as follows:
the tissues, or matters, are soaked in distilled water for some time.  If
no free acid is present, the liquid will not redden litmus-paper, or give
an acid reaction with any of the numerous tinctorial agents in use by the
chemist for the purposes of titration.  After sufficient digestion in water,
the liquid extract is made up to some definite bulk and allowed to subside.
Filtration is unnecessary.  A small fractional part (say, for example,
should the whole be 250 c.c., <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>100</sub>th or 2&middot;5 c.c.) is taken, and using as an
indicator cochineal or phenolphthalein, the total acidity is estimated by a
decinormal solution of soda.  By this preliminary operation, some guide
for the conduct of the future more exact operations is obtained. Should
the liquid be very acid, a small quantity of the whole is to be now
taken, but if the acidity is feeble, a larger quantity is necessary, and sufficient
quinine then added to fix the acid&mdash;100 parts of sulphuric acid
are saturated by 342 parts of quinine monohydrate.  Therefore, on the
supposition that all the free acid is sulphuric, it will be found sufficient
to add 3&middot;5 parts of quinine for every 1 part of acid, estimated as sulphuric,
found by the preliminary rough titration; and as it is inconvenient
to deal with large quantities of alkaloid, a fractional portion of the
liquid extract (representing not more than 50 mgrms. of acid) should be
taken, which will require 175 mgrms. of quinine.</p>

<p>On addition of the quinine, the neutralised liquid is evaporated to dryness,
or to approaching dryness, and then exhausted by strong alcohol.
The alcoholic extract is, after filtration, dried up, and the quinine sulphate,
nitrate, or hydrochlorate, as the case may be, filtered off and extracted
by boiling water, and precipitated by ammonia, the end result being
quinine hydrate (which may be filtered off and used again for similar
purposes) and a sulphate, nitrate or chloride of ammonia in solution.
It therefore remains to determine the nature and quantity of the acids
now combined with ammonia. The solution is made up to a known
bulk, and portions tested for chlorides by nitrate of silver, and for nitrates
by the copper or the ferrous sulphate test. If sulphuric acid is present,
there will be a precipitate of barium sulphate, which, on account of its
density and insolubility in nitric or hydrochloric acids, is very characteristic.
For estimating the sulphuric acid thus found, it will only be
necessary to take a known bulk of the same liquid, heat it to boiling
after acidifying by hydrochloric acid, and then add a sufficient quantity
of baric chloride solution. Unless this exact process is followed, the
analyst is likely to get a liquid which refuses to filter clear, but if the sulphate
be precipitated from a hot liquid, it usually settles rapidly to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
bottom of the vessel, and the supernatant fluid can be decanted clear; the
precipitate is washed by decantation, and ultimately collected on a filter,
dried, and weighed.</p>

<p>The sulphate of baryta found, multiplied by &middot;3434, equals the sulphuric
anhydride.</p>

<p>The older process was to dissolve the free sulphuric acid out by alcohol.
As is well known, mineral sulphates are insoluble in, and are precipitated
by, alcohol, whereas sulphuric acid enters into solution. The most valid
objection, as a quantitative process, to the use of alcohol, is the tendency
which all mineral acids have to unite with alcohol in organic combination,
and thus, as it were, to disappear; and, indeed, results are found, by
experiment, to be below the truth when alcohol is used. This objection
does not hold good if either merely qualitative evidence, or a fairly
approximate quantation, is required. In such a case, the vomited matters,
the contents of the stomach, or a watery extract of the tissues, are evaporated
to a syrup, and then extracted with strong alcohol and filtered; a
little phenolphthalein solution is added, and the acid alcohol exactly
neutralised by an alcoholic solution of clear decinormal or normal soda.
According to the acidity of the liquid, the amount used of the decinormal
or normal soda is noted, and then the whole evaporated to dryness, and
finally heated to gentle redness. The alkaline sulphate is next dissolved
in very dilute hydrochloric acid, and the solution precipitated by chloride
of barium in the usual way. The quantitative results, although low,
would, in the great majority of cases, answer the purpose sufficiently.</p>

<p>A test usually enumerated, Hilger&#8217;s test for mineral acid, may be mentioned.
A liquid, which contains a very minute quantity of mineral
acid, becomes of a blue colour (or, if 1 per cent. or above, of a green) on
the addition of a solution of methyl aniline violet; but this test, although
useful in examining vinegars (see &#8220;Foods,&#8221; p. 519), is not of much value
in toxicology, and the quinine method for this purpose meets every
conceivable case, both for qualitative and quantitative purposes.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_65" id="Sect_65"></a>&sect; 65. <b>The Urine.</b>&mdash;Although an excess of sulphates is found constantly
in the urine of persons who have taken large doses of sulphuric acid, the
latter has never been found in that liquid in a free state, so that it will
be useless to search for free acid. It is, therefore, only necessary to add
<span class="chemform">HCl</span> to filter the fluid, and precipitate direct with an excess of chloride of
barium. It is better to operate in this manner than to burn the urine
to an ash, for in the latter case part of the sulphates, in the presence of
phosphates, are decomposed, and, on the other hand, any organic sulphur
combinations are liable to be estimated as sulphates.</p>

<p>It may also be well to pass chlorine gas through the same urine which
has been treated with chloride of barium, and from which the sulphate
has been filtered off. The result of this treatment will be a second precipitate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
of sulphate derived from sulphur, in a different form of combination
than that of sulphate.</p>

<p>The greatest amount of sulphuric acid as mineral and organic sulphate
is separated, according to Mannkopf<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> and Schultzen,<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> within five hours
after taking sulphuric acid; after three days the secretion, so far as total
sulphates is concerned, is normal.</p>

<p>The normal amount of sulphuric acid excreted daily, according to
Thudichum, is from 1&middot;5 to 2&middot;5 grms., and organic sulphur up to &middot;2 grm.
in the twenty-four hours, but very much more has been excreted by
healthy persons.</p>

<p>Lehmann made some observations on himself, and found that, on an
animal diet, he excreted no less than 10&middot;399 grms. of sulphuric acid per
day, while on mixed food a little over 7 grms.; but, as Thudichum justly
observes, this great amount must be referred to individual peculiarity.
The amount of sulphates has a decided relation to diet. Animal food,
although not containing sulphates, yet, from the oxidation of the sulphur-holding
albumen, produces a urine rich in sulphate. Thus Vogel found
that a person, whose daily average was 2&middot;02 grms., yielded 7&middot;3 on a meat
diet. The internal use of sulphur, sulphides, and sulphates, given in an
ordinary medicinal way, is traceable in the urine, increasing the sulphates.
In chronic diseases the amount of sulphates is decreased, in acute increased.</p>

<p>Finally, it would appear that the determination of sulphates in the
urine is not of much value, <i>save when the normal amount that the individual
secretes is primarily known</i>. On the other hand, a low amount
of sulphates in the urine of a person poisoned by sulphuric acid has not
been observed within three days of the taking of the poison, and one
can imagine cases in which such a low result might have forensic
importance.</p>

<p>The presence of albumen in the urine has been considered by some a
constant result of sulphuric acid poisoning, but although when looked for
it is usually found, it cannot be considered constant. O. Smoler,<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> in
eighteen cases of various degrees of sulphuric acid poisoning, found
nothing abnormal in the urine. Wyss<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> found in the later stages of a
case indican and pus.  E. Leyden and Ph. Munn<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> always found blood
in the urine, as well as albumen, with casts and cellular elements.
Mannkopf<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> found albuminuria in three cases out of five; in two of the
cases there were fibrinous casts; in two the albumen disappeared at the
end of the second or third day, but in one it continued for more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
twenty days. Bamberger<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> has observed an increased albuminuria, with
separation of the colouring matter of the blood. In this case it was
ascribed to the action of the acid on the blood.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_66" id="Sect_66"></a>&sect; 66. <b>The Blood.</b>&mdash;In Casper&#8217;s case, No. 193, the vena cava of a child,
who died within an hour after swallowing a large dose of sulphuric acid,
was filled with a cherry-red, strongly acid-reacting blood. Again,
Casper&#8217;s case, No. 200, is that of a young woman, aged 19, who died
from a poisonous dose of sulphuric acid. At the autopsy, four days
after death, the following peculiarities of the blood were thus noted:&mdash;&#8220;The
blood had an acid reaction, was dark, and had (as is usual in these
cases) a syrupy consistence, while the blood-corpuscles were quite unchanged.
The blood was treated with an excess of absolute alcohol,
filtered, the filtrate concentrated on a water-bath, the residue exhausted
with absolute alcohol, &amp;c. It yielded a small quantity of sulphuric acid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Other similar cases might be noted, but it must not for a moment be
supposed that the mass of the blood contains any free sulphuric acid
during life. The acidity of the blood in the vena cava may be ascribed
to <i>post-mortem</i> endosmosis, the acid passing through the walls of the
stomach into the large vessel.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_67" id="Sect_67"></a>&sect; 67. <b>Sulphates.</b>&mdash;If the acid swallowed should have been entirely
neutralised by antidotes, such as chalk, &amp;c., it becomes of the first
importance to ascertain, as far as possible, by means of a microscopical
examination, the nature of the food remaining in the stomach, and then
to calculate the probable contents in sulphates of the food thus known to
be eaten. It will be found that, with ordinary food, and under ordinary
circumstances, only small percentages of combined sulphuric acid can be
present.</p>

<p>As an example, take the ordinary rations of the soldier, viz.:&mdash;12 oz.
of meat, 24 oz. of bread, 16 oz. of potatoes, 8 oz. of other vegetables; with
sugar, salt, tea, coffee, and water. Now, if the whole quantity of these
substances were eaten at a meal, they would not contain more than from
8 to 10 grains (&middot;5 to &middot;6 grm.) of anhydrous sulphuric acid, in the form of
sulphates.</p>

<p>So far as the contents of the stomach are concerned, we have only to
do with sulphates introduced in the food, but when once the food passes
further along the intestinal canal, circumstances are altered, for we have
sulphur-holding secretions, which, with ordinary chemical methods, yield
sulphuric acid. Thus, even in the newly-born infant, according to the
analyses of Zweifler, the mineral constituents of meconium are especially
sulphate of lime, with a smaller quantity of sulphate of potash. The
amount of bile which flows into the whole tract of the intestinal canal
is estimated at about half a litre in the twenty-four hours; the amount of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
sulphur found in bile varies from &middot;89 to 3 per cent., so that in 500 c.c.
we might, by oxidising the sulphur, obtain from 2&middot;2 to 7&middot;5 grms. of
sulphuric anhydride.</p>

<p>It is therefore certain that large quantities of organic sulphur-compounds
may be found in the human intestinal canal, for with individuals who
suffer from constipation, the residues of the biliary secretion accumulate
for many days. Hence, if the analyst searches for sulphates in excretal
matters, all methods involving destruction of organic substances, whether
by fire or by fluid-oxidising agents, are wrong in principle, and there is
nothing left save to separate soluble sulphates by dialysis, or to precipitate
direct out of an aqueous extract.</p>

<p>Again, sulphate of magnesia is a common medicine, and so is sodic
sulphate; a possible medicinal dose of magnesia sulphate might amount
to 56&middot;7 grms. (2 oz.), the more usual dose being half that quantity.
Lastly, among the insane there are found patients who will eat plaster-of-Paris,
earth, and similar matters, so that, in special cases, a very large
amount of combined sulphuric acid may be found in the intestinal tract,
without any relation to poisoning by the free acid; but in such instances
it must be rare, indeed, that surrounding circumstances or pathological
evidence will not give a clue to the real state of affairs.</p>

<h3>II.&mdash;Hydrochloric Acid.</h3>

<p><a name="Sect_68" id="Sect_68"></a>&sect; 68. <i>General Properties.</i>&mdash;Hydrochloric acid, otherwise called
<i>muriatic acid</i>, <i>spirit of salt</i>, is, in a strictly chemical sense, a pure gas,
composed of 97&middot;26 per cent. of chlorine, and 2&middot;74 per cent. of hydrogen;
but, in an ordinary sense, it is a liquid, being a solution of the gas itself.</p>

<p>Hydrochloric acid is made on an enormous scale in the United Kingdom,
the production being estimated at about a million tons annually.</p>

<p>The toxicology of hydrochloric acid is modern, for we have no evidence
that anything was known of it prior to the middle of the seventeenth
century, when Glauber prepared it in solution, and, in 1772, Priestley, by
treating common salt with sulphuric acid, isolated the pure gas.</p>

<p>The common liquid hydrochloric acid of commerce has a specific
gravity of from 1&middot;15 to 1&middot;20, and contains usually less than 40 parts of
hydrochloric acid in the 100 parts. The strength of pure samples of
hydrochloric acid can be told by the specific gravity, and a very close
approximation, in default of tables, may be obtained by simply multiplying
the decimal figures of the specific gravity by 200. For example,
an acid of 1&middot;20 gravity would by this rule contain 40 per cent. of real
acid, for &middot;20 &times; 200 = 40.</p>

<p>The commercial acid is nearly always a little yellow, from the presence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
of iron derived from metallic retorts, and usually contains small quantities
of chloride of arsenic,<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> derived from the sulphuric acid; but the
colourless hydrochloric acid specially made for laboratory and medicinal
use is nearly always pure.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_84" id="Footnote_84"></a><a href="#FNanchor_84"><span class="label">[84]</span></a> Some samples of hydrochloric acid have been found to contain as
much as 4 per cent. of chloride of arsenic, but this is very unusual.
Glenard found as a mean 2&middot;5 grammes, <span class="chemform">As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub></span> per kilogramme.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>The uses of the liquid acid are mainly in the production of chlorine,
as a solvent for metals, and for medicinal and chemical purposes. Its
properties are briefly as follows:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>It is a colourless or faintly-yellow acid liquid, the depth of colour
depending on its purity, and especially its freedom from iron. The
liquid is volatile, and can be separated from fixed matters and the less
volatile acids by distillation; it has a strong attraction for water, and
fumes when exposed to the air, from becoming saturated with aqueous
vapour. If exposed to the vapour of ammonia, extremely dense clouds
arise, due to the formation of the solid ammonium chloride. The acid,
boiled with a small quantity of manganese binoxide, evolves chlorine.
Dioxide of lead has a similar action; the chlorine may be detected by its
bleaching action on a piece of paper dipped in indigo blue; a little zinc
foil immersed in the acid disengages hydrogen. These two tests&mdash;viz.,
the production of chlorine by the one, and the production of hydrogen
by the other&mdash;separate and reveal the constituent parts of the acid.
Hydrochloric acid, in common with chlorides, gives a dense precipitate
with silver nitrate. The precipitate is insoluble in nitric acid, but
soluble in ammonia; it melts without decomposition. Exposed to the
light, it becomes of a purple or blackish colour. Every 100 parts of
silver chloride are equal to 25&middot;43 of hydrochloric acid, HCl, and to 63&middot;5
parts of the liquid acid of specific gravity 1&middot;20.</p>

<p>The properties of pure hydrochloric acid gas are as follows:&mdash;Specific
gravity 1&middot;262, consisting of equal volumes of hydrogen and chlorine,
united without condensation. 100 cubic inches must therefore have a
weight of 39&middot;36 grains. The gas was liquefied by Faraday by means of
a pressure of 40 atmospheres at 10&deg;; it was colourless, and had a less
refractive index than water.</p>

<p>Water absorbs the gas with avidity, 100 volumes of water absorbing
48,000 volumes of the gas, and becoming 142 volumes. The solution has
all the properties of strong hydrochloric acid, specific gravity 1&middot;21. The
dilute hydrochloric acid of the Pharmacop&#339;ia should have a specific
gravity of 1&middot;052, and be equivalent to 10&middot;58 per cent. of <span class="chemform">HCl</span>.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_71" id="Sect_71"></a>&sect; 71. <b>Amount of Free Acid in the Gastric Juice.</b>&mdash;Hydrochloric acid
exists in the gastric juice. This was first ascertained by Prout<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> in 1824;
he separated it by distillation. The observation was afterwards confirmed
by Gmelin,<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Children,<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> and Braconnot.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> On the other hand, Lehmann<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
pointed out that, as the stomach secretion contained, without doubt,
lactic acid, the act of distillation, in the presence of this lactic acid,
would set free hydrochloric acid from any alkaline chlorides. Blondlot
and Cl. Bernard also showed that the gastric juice possessed no acid which
would dissolve oxalate of lime, or develop hydrogen when treated with
iron filings; hence there could not be free hydrochloric acid which, even
in a diluted state, would respond to both these tests. Then followed the
researches of C. Schmidt,<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> who showed that the gastric secretion of men,
of sheep, and of dogs contained more hydrochloric acid than would satisfy
the bases present; and he propounded the view that the gastric juice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
does not contain absolutely free hydrochloric acid, but that it is in loose
combination with the pepsin.</p>

<p>The amount of acid in the stomach varies from moment to moment,
and therefore it is not possible to say what the average acidity of gastric
juice is. It has been shown that in the total absence of <i>free</i> hydrochloric
acid digestion may take place, because hydrochloric acid forms a compound
with pepsin which acts as a solvent on the food. The amount of
physiologically active acid varies with the food taken. It is smallest
when carbohydrates are consumed, greatest with meat. The maximum
amount that Jaksch found in his researches, when meat was ingested,
was &middot;09 per cent. of hydrochloric acid. It is probable that anything
above 0&middot;2 per cent. of hydrochloric acid is either abnormal or owing to
the recent ingestion of hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_72" id="Sect_72"></a>&sect; 72. <b>Influence of Hydrochloric Acid on Vegetation.</b>&mdash;Hydrochloric
acid fumes, if emitted from works on a large scale, injure vegetation
much. In former years, before any legal obligations were placed upon
manufacturers for the condensing of the volatile products, the nuisance
from this cause was great. In 1823, the duty on salt being repealed by
the Government, an extraordinary impetus was given to the manufacture
of hydrochloric acid, and since all the volatile products at that time
escaped through short chimneys into the air, a considerable area of land
round the works was rendered quite unfit for growing plants. The
present law on the subject is, that the maximum quantity of acid escaping
shall not exceed 2 grains per cubic foot of the air, smoke, or chimney
gases; and, according to the reports of the alkali inspectors, the condensation
by the improved appliances is well within the Act, and about as
perfect as can be devised.</p>

<p>It appears from the reports of the Belgian Commission in 1855, when
virtually no precautions were taken, that the gases are liable to injure
vegetation to the extent of 2000 metres (2187 yards) around any active
works; the more watery vapour the air contains, the quicker is the gas
precipitated and carried to the earth. If the action of the vapour is considerable,
the leaves of plants dry and wither; the chlorophyll becomes
modified, and no longer gives the normal spectrum, while a thickening of
the rind of trees has also been noticed. The cereals suffer much; they
increase in stalk, but produce little grain. The leguminos&aelig; become
spotted, and have an air of dryness and want of vigour; while the
potato, among plants utilised for food, appears to have the strongest
resistance. Vines are very sensitive to the gas. Among trees, the alder
seems most sensitive; then come fruit-trees, and last, the hardy forest-trees&mdash;the
poplar, the ash, the lime, the elm, the maple, the birch, and
the oak.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

cloth the acid produces a green stain, which is not moist and shows no
corrosion. On most matters the stain is more or less reddish; after a
little time no free acid may be detected, by simply moistening the spot;
but if the stain is cut out and boiled with water, there may be some
evidence of free acid. The absence of moisture and corrosion distinguishes
the stain from that produced by sulphuric acid.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_74" id="Sect_74"></a>&sect; 74. <b>Poisonous Effects of Hydrochloric Acid Gas.</b>&mdash;Eulenberg<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
has studied the effects of the vapour of this acid on rabbits and pigeons.
One of these experiments may be cited in detail. Hydrochloric acid gas,
prepared by heating together common salt and sulphuric acid, was passed
into a glass shade supported on a plate, and a rabbit was placed in the
transparent chamber thus formed. On the entrance of the vapour, there
was immediate blinking of the eyes, rubbing of the paws against the
nostrils, and emission of white fumes with the expired breath, while the
respiration was irregular (40 to the minute). After the lapse of ten
minutes, the gas was again introduced, until the atmosphere was quite
thick; the symptoms were similar to those detailed above, but more
violent; and in fourteen minutes from the commencement, the rabbit
sank down on its right side (respirations 32). When twenty-two minutes
had elapsed, the gas was again allowed to enter. The rabbit now lay
quiet, with closed eyes and laboured respiration, and, finally, after half-an-hour
of intermittent exposure to the gas, the animal was removed.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>The cornea were opalescent, and the eyes filled with water; there was
frequent shaking of the head and working of the forepaws. After three
minutes&#8217; exposure to the air, the respirations were found to be 128 per
minute; this quickened respiration lasted for an hour, then gave place to
a shorter and more superficial breathing. On the second day after the
experiment, the rabbit suffered from laboured respiration (28 to the
minute) and pain, and there was a rattling in the bronchial tubes. The
animal died on the third day, death being preceded by slow respiration
(12 to the minute).</p>

<p>The appearances twenty-four hours after death were as follows:&mdash;The
eyes were coated with a thick slime, and both cornea were opalescent;
there was strong rigidity of the body. The pia mater covering the brain
was everywhere hyper&aelig;mic, and at the hinder border of both hemispheres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
appeared a small clot, surrounded by a thin layer of bloody fluid.
The <i>plex. venos spin.</i> was filled with coagulated blood, and there was also
a thin extravasation of blood covering the medulla and pons. The lungs
were mottled bright brown-red; the middle lobe of the right lung was
dark brown, solid, and sank in water; the lower lobe of the same lung
and the upper lobe of the left lung were nearly in a similar condition,
but the edges were of a bright red. The parenchyma in the darker places
on section did not crepitate. On the cut surface was a little dark, fluid,
weakly-acid blood; the tracheal mucous membrane was injected. The
heart was filled with thick coagulated blood; the liver was congested, of
a reddish-brown colour, and rich in dark, fluid blood: in the vena cava
inferior was coagulated blood. The kidneys were not hyper&aelig;mic; the
intestines were superficially congested.</p>

<p>I think there can be little doubt that the symptoms during life, and
the appearances after death, in this case are perfectly consistent with the
following view:&mdash;The vapour acts first as a direct irritant, and is capable
of exciting inflammation in the lung and bronchial tissues; but besides
this, there is a secondary effect, only occurring when the gas is in sufficient
quantity, and the action sufficiently prolonged&mdash;viz., a direct coagulation
of the blood in certain points of the living vessels of the lungs. The
consequence of this is a more or less general backward engorgement, the
right side of the heart becomes distended with blood, and the ultimate
cause of death is partly mechanical. The hyper&aelig;mia of the brain membranes,
and even the h&aelig;morrhages, are quite consistent with this view,
and occur in cases where the obstruction to the circulation is of a coarser
and more obvious character, and can therefore be better appreciated.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_75" id="Sect_75"></a>&sect; 75. <b>Effects of the Liquid Acid.</b>&mdash;There is one distinction between
poisoning by hydrochloric and the other mineral acids&mdash;namely, the
absence of corrosion of the skin. Ad. Lesser<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> has established, by direct
experiment, that it is not possible to make any permanent mark on the
skin by the application even of the strongest commercial acid (40 per
cent.). Hence, in any case of suspected poisoning by acid, should there
be stains on the lips and face as from an acid, the presumption will be
rather against hydrochloric. The symptoms themselves differ very little
from those produced by sulphuric acid. The pathological appearances
also are not essentially different, but hydrochloric is a weaker acid, and
the extensive disorganisation, solution, and perforation of the viscera,
noticed occasionally with sulphuric acid, have never been found in hydrochloric
acid poisoning. We may quote here the following case:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>A woman, under the influence of great and sudden grief&mdash;not unmixed

quickly. She immediately uttered a cry, writhed, and vomited a yellow-green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
fluid. The abdomen also became enlarged. Milk was given her,
but she could not swallow it, and death took place, in convulsions, two
hours after the drinking of the poison.</p>

<p>The <i>post-mortem</i> appearances were briefly as follows:&mdash;Mouth and
tongue free from textural change: much gas in the abdomen, more
especially in the stomach; the membranes of the brain congested; the lungs
filled with blood. The stomach was strongly pressed forward, of a dark
brown-red, and exhibited many irregular blackish spots, varying from
two lines to half an inch in diameter (the spots were drier and harder
than the rest of the stomach); the mucous membrane, internally, was
generally blackened, and changed to a carbonised, shaggy, slimy mass,
while the organ was filled with a blackish homogeneous pulp, which had
no odour. The gullet was also blackened. A considerable quantity of
hydrochloric acid was separated from the stomach.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>The termination in this instance was unusually rapid. In a case
detailed by Casper,<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> in which a boy drank an unknown quantity of acid,
death took place in seven hours. In Guy&#8217;s Hospital museum, the duodenum
and stomach are preserved of a patient who is said to have died
in nine and a half hours from half an ounce of the acid. The same
quantity, in a case related by Taylor, caused death in eighteen hours.
From these and other instances, it may be presumed that death from
acute poisoning by hydrochloric acid will probably take place within
twenty-four hours. From the secondary effects, of course, death may
take place at a remote period, <i>e.g.</i>, in a case recorded by Dr. Duncan
(<i>Lancet</i>, April 12, 1890), a man drank about 1 oz. of <span class="chemform">HCl</span> accidentally,
was admitted to Charing Cross Hospital the same day, and treated with
small quantities of sodium carbonate, and fed by the rectum. On the
eighth day he brought up 34 oz. of blood; in a month he left apparently
perfectly well, but was admitted again in about six weeks, and died of
contraction of the stomach and stricture of the pylorus on the ninety-fourth
day.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p><a name="Sect_76" id="Sect_76"></a>&sect; 76. <b>Post-mortem Appearances.</b>&mdash;The pathological appearances are
very similar to those found in the case already detailed; though the
skin of the face may not be eroded in any way by the acid, yet the more
delicate mucous membrane of the mouth, gullet, &amp;c., appears mostly to
be changed, and is usually white or whitish-brown. There is, however,
in the museum of the Royal College of Surgeons the stomach and gullet
(No. 2386c.) of an infant thirteen months old; the infant drank a tea-cupful
of strong hydrochloric acid, and died nine hours after the dose. The
pharynx and the upper end of the gullet is quite normal, the corrosive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
action commencing at the lower end, so that, although the acid was concentrated,
not the slightest effect was produced on the delicate mucous
membrane of the throat and upper part of the gullet. The lower end of
the gullet and the whole of the stomach were intensely congested; the
rug&aelig; of the latter were ecchymosed and blackened by the action of
the acid. There were also small h&aelig;morrhages in the lungs, which were
ascribed to the action of the acid on the blood. Perforation of the
stomach has not been noticed in hydrochloric acid poisoning.</p>

<p>In Guy&#8217;s Hospital museum (prep. 1799<sup>10</sup>), the stomach and duodenum
of the case mentioned exhibit the mucous membrane considerably injected,
with extravasations of blood, which, at the time when the preparation
was first arranged, were of various hues, but are now somewhat altered,
through long keeping in spirit. In St. George&#8217;s Hospital museum (ser.
x. 43, d. 200) are preserved the stomach and part of the duodenum of a
person who died from hydrochloric acid. The case is detailed in the
<i>Medical Times and Gazette</i> for 1853, vol. ii. p. 513. The whole inner
surface appears to be in a sloughing state, and the larynx and lung were
also inflamed.</p>

<p>A preparation, presented by Mr. Bowman to King&#8217;s College Hospital
museum, exhibits the effects of a very large dose of hydrochloric acid.
The gullet has a shrivelled and worm-eaten appearance; the stomach is
injected with black blood, and was filled with an acid, grumous matter.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>Looking at these and other museum preparations illustrating the effects
of sulphuric and hydrochloric acids, I was unable (in default of the
history of the cases) to distinguish between the two, by the naked eye
appearances, save in those cases in which the disorganisation was so
excessive as to render hydrochloric acid improbable. On the other hand,
the changes produced by nitric acid are so distinctive, that it is impossible
to mistake its action for that of any other acid. The nitric acid
pathological preparations may be picked out at a glance.</p>

<h4>Detection and Estimation of Free Hydrochloric Acid.</h4>

<p><a name="Sect_77" id="Sect_77"></a>&sect; 77. (1) <b>Detection.</b>&mdash;A large number of colouring reagents have been
proposed as tests for the presence of free mineral acid; among the best
is <i>methyl-aniline violet</i> decolorised by a large amount of hydrochloric acid;
the violet turns to green with a moderate quantity, and to blue with a
small quantity.</p>

<p><b>Trop&aelig;olin</b> (00), in the presence of free mineral acid, strikes a ruby-red
to a dark brown-red.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Congo-red</b> is used in the form of paper dyed with the material; large
amounts of free hydrochloric acid strike blue-black, small quantities
blue.</p>

<p><b>G&uuml;nzburg&#8217;s test</b> is 2 parts phloroglucin and 1 part vanillin, dissolved
in 100 parts of alcohol. Fine red crystals are precipitated on the addition
of hydrochloric acid. To test the stomach contents for free
hydrochloric acid by means of this reagent, equal parts of the fluid and
the test are evaporated to dryness in the water-bath in a porcelain dish.
If free hydrochloric acid be present, the evaporated residue shows a red
colour; 1 mgrm. of acid can by this test be detected. The reaction is
not interfered with by organic acids, peptones, or albumin.</p>

<p>Jaksch speaks highly of <i>benzopurpurin</i> as a test. Filter-paper is soaked
in a saturated aqueous solution of benzopurpurin 6 B (the variety 1 or
4 B is not so sensitive), and the filter-paper thus prepared allowed to
dry. On testing the contents of the stomach with the reagent, if there
is more than 4 parts per 1000 of hydrochloric acid the paper is stained
intensely blue-black; but if the colour is brown-black, this is from
butyric or lactic acids, or from a mixture of these acids with hydrochloric
acid. If the paper is washed with pure ether, and the colour was due only
to organic acids, the original hue of the paper is restored; if the colour
produced was due to a mixture of mineral and organic acids, the brown-black
colour is weakened; and, lastly, if due to hydrochloric acid alone,
the colour is not altered by washing with ether. Acid salts have no
action, nor is the test interfered with by large amounts of albumins and
peptones.</p>

<p>A. Villiers and M. Favolle<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> have published a sensitive test for hydrochloric
acid. The test consists of a saturated aqueous solution of colourless
aniline, 4 parts; glacial acetic acid, 1 part; 0&middot;1 mgrm. of hydrochloric
acid strikes with this reagent a blue colour, 1 mgrm. a black colour.
The liquid under examination is brought by evaporation, or by the
addition of water, to 10 c.c. and placed in a flask; to this is added 5 c.c.
of a mixture of equal parts of sulphuric acid and water, then 10 c.c. of a
saturated solution of potassic permanganate, and heated gently, conveying
the gases into 3 to 5 c.c. of the reagent contained in a test-tube
immersed in water. If, however, bromine or iodine (one or both)
should be present, the process is modified as follows:&mdash;The hydracids
are precipitated by silver nitrate; the precipitate is washed, transferred
to a small flask, and treated with 10 c.c. of water and 1 c.c.
of pure ammonia. With this strength of ammonia the chloride of
silver is dissolved easily, the iodide not at all, and the bromide but
slightly. The ammoniacal solution is filtered, boiled, and treated
with <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>; the excess of <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span> is expelled by boiling, the liquid filtered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
reduced to 10 c.c. by boiling or evaporation, sulphuric acid and
permanganate added as before, and the gases passed into the aniline.
The process is inapplicable to the detection of chlorides or hydrochloric
acid if cyanides are present, and it is more adapted for traces
of hydrochloric acid than for the quantities likely to be met with
in a toxicological inquiry.</p>

<p>(2) <b>Quantitative estimation of Free Hydrochloric Acid.</b>&mdash;The contents
of the stomach are diluted to a known volume, say 250 or 500 c.c.
A fractional portion is taken, say 10 c.c., coloured with litmus or phenol-phthalein,
and a decinormal solution of soda added drop by drop until the
colour changes; this gives total acidity. Another 10 c.c. is shaken with
double its volume of ether three times, the fluid separated from ether and
titrated in the same way; this last titration will give the acidity due
to mineral acids and acid salts;<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> if the only mineral acid present is
hydrochloric acid the results will be near the truth if reckoned as such,
and this method, although not exact for physiological research, is usually
sufficient for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of hydrochloric acid
or other mineral acids in a case of poisoning. It depends on the fact that
ether extracts free organic acids, such as butyric and lactic acids, but does
not extract mineral acids.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_99" id="Footnote_99"></a><a href="#FNanchor_99"><span class="label">[99]</span></a> To distinguish between acidity due to free acid and acid salts, or
to acidity due to the combined action of acid salts and free acids, the
method of Leo and Uffelmann is useful. A fractional portion of the
contents of the stomach is triturated with pure calcium carbonate; if
all the acidity is due to free acid, the fluid in a short time becomes
neutral to litmus; if, on the other hand, the acidity is due entirely to
acid salts, the fluid remains acid; or, if due to both acid and acid
salts, there is a proportionate diminution of acidity due to the
decomposition of the lime carbonate by the free acid. A quantitative
method has been devised upon these principles. See Leo, <i>Diagnostik der
Krankheiten der Verdauungsorgane</i>, Hirschwald, Berlin, 1890.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>The free mineral acid, after extracting the organic acid by ether, can
also be saturated with cinchonine; this hydrochlorate of cinchonine is
extracted by chloroform, evaporated to dryness, and the residue dissolved
in water acidified by nitric acid and precipitated by silver nitrate; the
silver chloride produced is collected on a small filter, washed, and the
filter, with its contents, dried and ignited in a porcelain crucible; the
silver chloride, multiplied by 0&middot;25426, equals <span class="chemform">HCl</span>.</p>

<p>The best method of estimating free hydrochloric acid in the stomach
is that of Sjokvist as modified by v. Jaksch;<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> it has the disadvantage
of its accuracy being interfered with by phosphates; it also does not
distinguish between actual free <span class="chemform">HCl</span> and the loosely bound <span class="chemform">HCl</span> with
albuminous matters,&mdash;this in a toxicological case is of small importance,
because the quantities of <span class="chemform">HCl</span> found are likely to be large.</p>

<p>The method is based upon the fact that if carbonate of baryta be
added to the contents of the stomach, the organic acids will decompose
the barium carbonate, forming butyrate, acetate, lactate, &amp;c., of barium;
and the mineral acids, such as hydrochloric acid, will combine, forming
salts of barium.</p>

<p>On ignition, chloride of barium will be unaffected, while the organic
salts of barium will be converted into carbonate of barium, practically
insoluble in carbonic acid free water.</p>

<p>The contents of the stomach are coloured with litmus, and barium
carbonate added until the fluid is no longer acid (as shown by the disappearance
of the red colour); then the contents are evaporated to
dryness in a platinum dish, and ignited at a dull red heat; complete
burning to an ash is not necessary. After cooling, the burnt mass is
repeatedly exhausted with boiling water and filtered; the chloride of
barium is precipitated from the filtrate by means of dilute sulphuric
acid; the barium sulphate filtered off, washed, dried, and, after ignition,
weighed; 233 parts of barium sulphate equal 73 parts of <span class="chemform">HCl</span>.</p>

<p>A method somewhat quicker, but depending on the same principles,
has been suggested by Braun.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> A fractional part, say 10 c.c., of
the fluid contents is coloured by litmus and titrated with decinormal
soda. To the same quantity is added 2 or 3 more c.c. of decinormal
soda than the quantity used in the first titration; this alkaline
liquid is evaporated to dryness and ultimately ignited. To the ash
is now added exactly the quantity of decinormal sulphuric acid
as the decinormal soda last used to make it alkaline&mdash;that is to say,
if the total acidity was equal to 3&middot;6 d.n. soda, and 5&middot;0 d.n. soda was added
to the 10 c.c. evaporated to dryness and burned, then 5&middot;6 c.c. of d.n.
sulphuric acid is added to the ash. The solution is now warmed to get
rid of carbon dioxide, and, after addition of a little phenolphthalein,
titrated with d.n. soda solution until the change of colour shows saturation,
the number of c.c. used, multiplied by 0&middot;00365, equals the HCl.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_78" id="Sect_78"></a>&sect; 78. In investigating the stains from hydrochloric acid on fabrics, or
the leaves of plants, any free hydrochloric acid may be separated by
boiling with water, and then investigating the aqueous extract. Should,
however, the stain be old, all free acid may have disappeared, and yet
some of the chlorine remain in organic combination with the tissue, or in
combination with bases. Dr. Angus Smith has found weighed portions
of leaves, &amp;c., which had been exposed to the action of hydrochloric
acid fumes, richer in chlorides than similar parts of the plants not thus
exposed.</p>

<p>The most accurate method of investigation for the purpose of separating
chlorine from combination with organic matters is to cut out the stained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
portions, weigh them, and burn them up in a combustion-tube, the front
portion of the tube being filled with caustic lime known to be free from
chlorides; a similar experiment must be made with the unstained portions.
In this way a considerable difference may often be found; and it is not
impossible, in some instances, to thus detect, after the lapse of many
years, that certain stains have been produced by a chlorine-holding
substance.</p>

<p>By surrounding the receiver with a freezing mixture, the acid is condensed
in crystals, which dissolve in water, with emission of much heat,
forming nitric acid. Sometimes the crystals, though kept in sealed tubes,
decompose, and the tube, from the pressure of the liberated gases, bursts
with a dangerous explosion.</p>

<p>Pure nitric acid has a specific gravity of 1&middot;52, and boils at 98&deg;. Dr.
Ure examined the boiling point and other properties of nitric acid very
fully. An acid of 1&middot;5 specific gravity boils at 98&middot;8&deg;; of specific gravity
1&middot;45, at 115&middot;5&deg;; specific gravity 1&middot;40, at 118&middot;8&deg;; of specific gravity 1&middot;42, at
122&middot;8&deg;. The acid of specific gravity 1&middot;42 is the standard acid of the
British Pharmacop&#339;ia. It can always be obtained by distilling either
strong or moderately weak nitric acid; for, on the one hand, the acid on
distillation gets weaker until the gravity of 1&middot;42 is reached, or, on the
other, it becomes stronger.</p>

<p>There is little doubt that acid of 1&middot;42 gravity is a definite hydrate,
consisting of 1 atom of dry acid and 4 atoms of water; it corresponds to
75 per cent.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> of the liquid acid <span class="chemform">HNO<sub>3</sub></span>. There are also at least two other

specific gravity of 1&middot;33 to 1&middot;34 (66&deg; to 68&deg; Twad.), that is, strength from
56 to 58 per cent. of <span class="chemform">HNO<sub>3</sub></span>. <i>Engravers&#8217;</i> acid is stronger; being of 1&middot;40
specific gravity (80&deg; Twad.); and contains 70 per cent. of <span class="chemform">HNO<sub>3</sub></span>.
Although the <i>pure</i> acid of commerce is (and should be) almost colourless,
most commercial specimens are of hues from yellow up to deep red. An
acid saturated with red oxides of nitrogen is often known as &#8220;fuming
nitric acid.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="Sect_80" id="Sect_80"></a>&sect; 80. <b>Use in the Arts.</b>&mdash;Nitric acid is employed very extensively in
the arts and manufactures. The dyer uses it as a solvent for tin in the
preparation of valuable mordants for calico and other fabrics; the
engraver uses it for etching copper. It is an indispensable agent in the
manufacture of gun-cotton, nitro-glycerin, picric acid, and sulphuric
acid; it is also used in the manufacture of tallow, in preparing the felt
for hats, and in the gilding trades. It is said to be utilised to make
yellowish or fawn-coloured spots on cigar leaves, so as to give them the
appearance of age and quality. It is also used as a medicine.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_81" id="Sect_81"></a>&sect; 81. <b>Statistics of Poisoning by Nitric Acid.</b>&mdash;In the ten years
1883-1892 no case of murder was ascribed to nitric acid, but it caused
accidentally 25 deaths, and was used in 27 cases of suicide.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_82" id="Sect_82"></a>&sect; 82. <b>Fatal Dose.</b>&mdash;The dose which causes death has not been ascertained
with any exactness. As in the case of sulphuric acid, we may go
so far as to say that it is possible for a few drops of the strong acid to be
fatal, for if brought into contact with the vocal apparatus, fatal spasm
of the glottis might be excited. The smallest dose on record is 7&middot;7 grms.
(2 drachms), which killed a child aged 13.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_83" id="Sect_83"></a>&sect; 83. <b>Action of Nitric Acid on Vegetation.</b>&mdash;Nitric acid acts on
plants injuriously in a two-fold manner&mdash;viz., by direct corrosive action,
and also by decomposing the chlorides which all plants contain, thus
setting free chlorine, which decomposes and bleaches the chlorophyll.
The action is most intense on soft and delicate leaves, such as those of
clover, the cabbage, and all the crucifer&aelig;. The tobacco plant is particularly
injured by nitric acid. Next to all herbaceous plants, trees, such
as the apple, pear, and fruit trees, generally suffer. The conifer&aelig;,
whether from their impregnation with resin, or from some other cause,
possess a considerable resisting-power against nitric acid vapours, and
the same is true as regards the cereals; in the latter case, their siliceous
armour acts as a preserving agent.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_84" id="Sect_84"></a>&sect; 84. <b>Nitric Acid Vapour.</b>&mdash;The action of nitric acid in a state of
vapour, as evolved by warming potassic nitrate and sulphuric acid
together, has been studied by Eulenberg. A rabbit was placed under a
shade into which 63 grains of nitric acid in a state of vapour were introduced.
From the conditions of the experiment, some nitric peroxide
must also have been present. Irritation of the external mucous membranes
and embarrassment in breathing were observed. The animal in
forty-five minutes was removed, and suffered afterwards from a croupous
bronchitis, from which, however, it completely recovered in eleven days.
A second experiment with the same animal was followed by death. On
inspection, there was found strong injection of the cerebral membranes,
with small extravasations of blood; the lungs were excessively congested;
the right middle lobe especially was of a liver-brown colour, and
empty of air: it sank in water.</p>

<p>O. Lassar<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> has also made a series of researches on the influence of
nitric acid vapour, from which he concludes that the acid is not absorbed
by the blood, but acts only by its mechanical irritation, for he could not
trace, by means of an examination of the urine, any evidence of such
absorption.</p>

<p>There are a few instances on record of the vapour having been fatal
to men; for example, the well-known case of Mr. Haywood, a chemist of
Sheffield, may be cited. In pouring a mixture of nitric and sulphuric
acids from a carboy of sixty pounds capacity, the vessel broke, and for
a few minutes he inhaled the mixed fumes. He died eleven hours after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the accident, although for the first three hours there were scarcely any
symptoms of an injurious effect having been produced. On inspection,
there was found intense congestion of the windpipe and bronchial tubes,
with effusion of blood in the latter. The lining membrane of the heart
and aorta was inflamed; unfortunately, the larynx was not examined.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

to wipe up the acid from the floor. The one died ten hours after the
accident, the other in less than twenty-four hours. The symptoms were
mainly those of difficult breathing, and it is probable that death was
produced from suffocation. Dr. Taylor relates also, that having accidentally
inhaled the vapour in preparing gun-cotton, he suffered from severe
constriction of the throat, tightness in the chest, and cough, for more
than a week.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p><a name="Sect_85" id="Sect_85"></a>&sect; 85. <b>Effects of Liquid Nitric Acid.</b>&mdash;Poisoning by nitric acid, though
still rare, is naturally more frequent than formerly. At the beginning
of this century, Tartra<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> wrote a most excellent monograph on the subject,
and collated all the cases he could find, from the first recorded
instances related by Bembo<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> in Venetian history, down to his own time.
The number of deaths in those 400 years was but fifty-five, while, in our
century, at least fifty can be numbered. Most of these (74 per cent.) are
suicidal, a very few homicidal, the rest accidental. In one of Tartra&#8217;s
cases, some nitric acid was placed in the wine of a drunken woman, with
fatal effect. Osenbr&uuml;ggen<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> relates the case of a father murdering his six
children by means of nitric acid; and C. A. B&uuml;chner<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> that of a soldier
who poured acid into the mouth of his illegitimate infant. A curious
case is one in which a man poisoned his drunken wife by pouring the
acid into her right ear; she died after six weeks&#8217; illness. All these
instances prove again, if necessary, that the acid is only likely to be used
with murderous intent in the case of young children, or of sleeping,
drunken, or otherwise helpless people.</p>

<p>As an example of the way in which accidents are brought about by
heedlessness, may be cited the recent case of a woman who bought a
small quantity of aqua fortis for the purpose of allaying toothache by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
local application. She attempted to pour the acid direct from the bottle
into the cavity of the tooth; the acid went down her throat, and the
usual symptoms followed. She threw up a very perfect cast of the
gullet (preserved in University College museum), and rapidly died.
Nitric acid has been mistaken for various liquids, and has also been used
by injection as an abortive, in every respect having a toxicological history
similar to that of sulphuric acid.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_86" id="Sect_86"></a>&sect; 86. <b>Local Action.</b>&mdash;When strong nitric acid comes in contact with
organic matters, there is almost constantly a development of gas. The
tissue is first bleached, and then becomes of a more or less intense yellow
colour. Nitric acid spots on the skin are not removed by ammonia, but
become of an orange-red when moistened with potash and a solution of
cyanide of potassium. The yellow colour seems to show that picric acid
is one of the constant products of the reaction; sulphide of ammonium
forms a sort of soap with the epidermis thus attacked, and detaches it.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_87" id="Sect_87"></a>&sect; 87. <b>Symptoms.</b>&mdash;The symptoms and course of nitric acid poisoning
differ in a few details only from those of sulphuric acid. There
is the same instant pain and frequent vomiting, destruction of the
mucous membranes, and, in the less severe cases, after-contraction of
the gullet, &amp;c.</p>

<p>One of the differences in the action of nitric and sulphuric acids is the
constant development of gas with the former. This, without doubt,
adds to the suffering. Tartra made several experiments on dead bodies,
and showed that very considerable distension of the intestinal canal, by
gaseous products, was the constant result; the tissues were corroded and
almost dissolved, being transformed, ultimately, into a sort of greasy
paste. The vomited matters are of a yellow colour, unless mixed with
blood, when they are of a dirty-brown hue, with shreds of yellow
mucus, and have the strong acid reaction and smell of nitric acid. The
teeth may be partially attacked from the solvent action of the acid on
the enamel. The fauces and tongue, at first blanched, soon acquire a
citron-yellow, or even a brown colour; the whole cavity may swell and
inflame, rendering the swallowing of liquids difficult, painful, and sometimes
impossible. The air passages may also become affected, and in one
case tracheotomy was performed for the relief of the breathing.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> The
stomach rejects all remedies; there are symptoms of collapse; quick,
weak pulse, frequent shivering, obstinate constipation, and death (often
preceded by a kind of stupor) in from eighteen to twenty-four hours.
The intellectual faculties remain clear, save in a few rare instances.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>C. A. Wunderlich has recorded an unusual case, in which the symptoms
were those of dysentery, and the large intestine was found acutely
inflamed, while the small one was little affected. The kidneys had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
same appearance as in Bright&#8217;s disease.<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> The smallest fatal dose given
by Taylor is from 2 drachms, which killed a child aged 13 years.
Should the dose of nitric acid be insufficient to kill at once, or, what
amounts to the same thing, should the acid be immediately diluted with
water, or in some way be neutralised, the patient, as in the case of
sulphuric acid, may yet die at a variable future time from stenosis of the
gullet, impaired digestion, &amp;c. For example, in an interesting case
related by Tartra,<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> a woman, who had swallowed 42 grms. (1&middot;5 oz.) of
nitric acid, feeling acute pain, took immediately a quantity of water, and
three hours afterwards was admitted into hospital, where she received
appropriate treatment. At the end of a month she left, believing herself
cured; but in a little while returned, and was re-admitted, suffering from
marasmus, extreme weakness, and constant vomiting; ultimately she
died. The <i>post-mortem</i> examination revealed extreme contraction of the
intestinal canal throughout. The lumen would hardly admit a penholder.
The stomach was no larger than an ordinary intestine, and adherent to
adjacent organs; on its internal surface there were spots, probably
cicatrices; there were also changes in the gullet, but not so marked. A
somewhat similar case is related by the same author in his thirteenth
observation. In the Middlesex Hospital there is preserved the stomach
(No. 1363) of a man who died forty days after swallowing 2 ozs. of
nitric acid diluted in a tumbler of water. The stomach is contracted,
the mucous membrane of the lower part of the gullet, the lesser curvature,
and the pyloric end of the stomach is extensively corroded, showing
ulcerated patches commencing to cicatrize.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_88" id="Sect_88"></a>&sect; 88. <b>Post-mortem Appearances.</b>&mdash;The pathological changes in the
tongue, gullet, and stomach can be readily studied from the preparations
in the different museums. The staining by the nitric acid appears
unchanged to the naked eye for many years; hence, most of the nitric
acid preparations are in an excellent state of preservation. A very good
example of the pathological changes is to be found in Nos. 1049 and
1050, University College museum.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>No. 1049 presents the tongue, pharynx, and larynx of a man who had swallowed
a tea-cupful of nitric acid. The epithelium of the &#339;sophagus is for the most part
wanting, and hangs in shreds; the dorsum of the tongue, in front of the circumvallate
papill&aelig;, is excavated, and over its central part superficially ulcerated; in
other places the tongue is encrusted with a thick, loose, fawn-coloured layer, formed
probably of desquamated epithelium. The whole of the mucous surface is stained of
a dirty yellow.</p>

<p>No. 1050 is a preparation showing the tongue, gullet, and stomach of a person
who died from the effects of nitric acid. The tongue in places is smooth and glazed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"><span class="fsize110">[108]</span></a></span>
in others, slightly depressed and excavated. On the anterior wall and lower portion
of the gullet two large sloughs exist.</p>

<p>Although perforation of the stomach is not so common with nitric as with sulphuric
acid, such an accident may occur, as shown in a preparation at Guy&#8217;s Hospital,
in which there is a perforation at the cardiac end. All the mucous membrane
has disappeared, and the inner surface is for the most part covered with
flocculent shreds. Three ounces of nitric acid are said to have been swallowed, and
the patient lived seventeen hours. There is the usual staining. There is also in
the Middlesex Hospital (No. 1364) the &#339;sophagus and stomach of a woman aged 30,
who died six hours after swallowing 2 to 3 ozs. of strong nitric acid. The inner coats
of the mucous membrane of the gullet and stomach are in part converted into opaque
yellow and black eschars, and in part to a shreddy pulpy condition. At the most
depending part of the stomach is a large ragged perforation, with pulpy margins,
which allowed the contents of the stomach to escape into the peritoneal cavity.</p>

<p>In St. Bartholomew&#8217;s museum, there is a very good specimen (No. 1870) of the
appearances in the gullet and stomach after poisoning by nitric acid. The case is
detailed in <i>St. Bartholomew&#8217;s Hospital Reports</i>, vol. v. p. 247. A male died in
fifteen hours after swallowing 1 oz. of nitric acid. The whole mucous membrane
is wrinkled, or rather ploughed, into longitudinal furrows, the yellow discoloration
stops abruptly, with an irregular border, at the commencement of the
stomach, the epithelial and mucous coats of which are wanting&mdash;its surface being
rough and of a brownish-red colour.</p>

<p>The following preparations are to be found in the museum of the London Hospital:&mdash;A.
b. 1. and A. b. 8.&mdash;A. b. 1. shows the pharynx, &#339;sophagus, larynx, and stomach
of a young woman, who, after taking half an ounce of nitric acid, died in eight hours.
The staining is very intense; as an unusual feature, it may be noted that the larynx
is almost as yellow as the &#339;sophagus. The abrasion or solution of the epithelium
on the dorsum of the tongue has dissected out the circumvallate and fungiform
papill&aelig;, so that they project with unusual distinctness. The lining membrane of
the gullet throughout is divided into minute squares by longitudinal and transverse
furrows. The mucous membrane of the stomach appears wholly destroyed, and
presents a woolly appearance.</p>

<p>A. b. 8. shows a very perfect cast of the &#339;sophagus. The case was that of a
woman, aged 35, who swallowed half an ounce of nitric acid. The symptoms for the
first four days were the usual pain in the throat and stomach, which might be
expected; the bowels were freely open, and the stools dark and offensive. On the
sixth day, there was constant vomiting with offensive breath; on the ninth, the
appearance of the patient was critical, and she threw up the cast preserved. She died
on the tenth day after the taking of the acid. The gullet, stomach, trachea, and
larynx were found after death much inflamed.</p>

<p>The following preparations are in St. Thomas&#8217; Hospital:&mdash;P. 5.&mdash;a stomach with
gullet attached. The stomach is covered with yellowish-green patches of false membrane
and deposit; the gullet has the usual longitudinal furrows so characteristic of
corrosive fluids.</p>

<p>P. 6. is also from a case of nitric acid poisoning. It shows the lining membrane
of the stomach partly destroyed and shreddy, yet but little discoloured, the hue
being a sort of delicate fawn.</p>

<p>To these may be added a case described and figured by Lesser; to a baby, a
few days old, an unknown quantity of fuming nitric acid was given; the child
made a gurgling, choking sound, and died in a few minutes. The corpse, nine
days after death, showed no signs of decomposition. The tongue and gums were
yellow, the gullet less so, the stomach still less, and the small intestine had
no yellow tint; the whole of the mouth, gullet, and stomach showed the corrosive
action of the acid. The graduation of tint, Lesser remarks, is what is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"><span class="fsize110">[109]</span></a></span>
seen when the yellow colour is due to poisoning by chromic acid or by strong
solution of ferric perchloride; in such cases, wherever the liquid has gone, there is a
yellowness.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize110">[114]</span></a></p>

<p><a name="Sect_89" id="Sect_89"></a>&sect; 89. <b>Detection and Estimation of Nitric Acid.</b>&mdash;The detection
either of free nitric acid or of its salts is not difficult. Free nitric acid,
after preliminary estimation of the total acidity by decinormal soda, may
be separated by the cinchonine process given at <a href="#Page_100">p. 100</a>. On precipitation
by ammonia or soda solution, the nitrate of ammonia or soda (and,
it may be, other similarly combined acids) remain in solution. If free
nitric acid is present in small quantity only, it may be necessary to
evaporate the filtrate from the quinine nearly to dryness, and to test the
concentrated liquid for nitric acid. The ordinary tests are as follows:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1.) Nitrates, treated with mercury or copper and strong sulphuric
acid, develop nitric oxide, recognised by red fumes, if mixed with air or
oxygen.</p>

<p>(2.) A nitrate dissolved in a small quantity of water, with the addition
of a crystal of ferrous sulphate (allowed to partially dissolve), and then
of strong sulphuric acid&mdash;poured through a funnel with a long tube
dipping to the bottom of the test-tube, so as to form a layer at the
bottom&mdash;strikes a brown colour at the junction of the liquid. When
the test is properly performed, there will be three layers&mdash;the uppermost
being the nitrate solution, the middle ferrous sulphate, and the
lowest sulphuric acid; the middle layer becomes of a smoky or black
hue if a nitrate is present. Organic matter interferes much with the
reaction.</p>

<p>(3.) Nitrates in solution, treated in the cold with a zinc copper couple,
are decomposed first into nitrites, and then into ammonia. The nitrites
may be detected by a solution of metaphenyldiamine, which strikes
a red colour with an infinitesimal quantity. Hence, a solution which
gives no red colour with metaphenyldiamine, when submitted to the
action of a zinc copper couple, and tested from time to time, cannot
contain nitrites; therefore, no nitrates were originally present.</p>

<p>(4.) Nitrates, on being treated with strong sulphuric acid, and then
a solution of indigo carmine dropped in, decolorise the indigo; this
is a useful test&mdash;not conclusive in itself, but readily applied, and
if the cinchonine method of separation has been resorted to, with few

<p>There is a process of separating nitric acid direct from any organic
tissue, which may sometimes be useful:&mdash;Place the substance in a strong,
wide-mouthed flask, closed by a caoutchouc cork, and in the flask put a
small, short test-tube, charged with a strong solution of ferrous chloride
in hydrochloric acid. The flask is connected to the mercury pump (see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
fig. <a href="#Page_47">p. 47</a>), and made perfectly vacuous by raising and lowering the reservoir.
When this is effected, the tube SS&#8242;P is adjusted so as to deliver
any gas evolved into a eudiometer, or other gas-measuring apparatus.
By a suitable movement of the flask, the acid ferrous chloride is allowed
to come in contact with the tissue, a gentle heat applied to the flask, and
gases are evolved. These may be carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and nitric
oxide. On the evolution of gas ceasing, the carbon dioxide is absorbed
by passing up under the mercury a little caustic potash. When absorption
is complete, the gas, consisting of nitrogen and nitric oxide, may be
measured. A bubble or two of oxygen is now passed into the eudiometer;
if nitric oxide is present, red fumes at once develop. On absorbing
the excess of oxygen and the nitric peroxide by alkaline pyrogallate,
and measuring the residual gas, it is easy to calculate how much nitric
oxide was originally present, according to the principles laid down in
&#8220;Foods,&#8221; p. 587.</p>

<p>It is also obvious that, by treating nitric oxide with oxygen, and
absorbing the nitric peroxide present by an alkaline liquid of known
strength and free from nitrates or ammonia, the resulting solution may
be dealt with by a zinc copper couple, and the ammonia developed
by the action of the couple directly estimated by titration by a decinormal
hydrochloric acid, if large in quantity, or by &#8220;<i>nesslerising</i>,&#8221;
if small in quantity. Crum&#8217;s method of estimating nitrates (&#8220;Foods,&#8221; p.
568) in the cases of minute stains on fabrics, &amp;c., with a little modification,
may be occasionally applicable.</p>

<h3>IV.&mdash;Acetic Acid.</h3>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><a name="Sect_90" id="Sect_90"></a>&sect; 90. In the ten years ending 1893 nine deaths (four males and five females)
occurred in England and Wales from drinking, by mistake or design, strong acetic
acid.</p>

<p>A few cases only have been recorded in medical literature although there have
been many experiments on animals.</p>

<p>The symptoms in the human subject consist of pain, vomiting, and convulsions.</p>

<p>In animals it causes colic, paralysis of the extremities, bloody urine, and &#339;dema
of the lungs. The lethal dose for plant-eating animals is about 0&middot;49 gramme per kilo.</p>

<p>There should be no difficulty in recognising acetic acid; the odour alone is, in
most cases, strong and unmistakable. Traces are detected by distilling, neutralising
the distillate by soda, evaporating to dryness, and treating the residue as follows:&mdash;A
portion warmed with alcohol and sulphuric acid gives a smell of acetic ether.
Another portion is heated in a small tube of hard glass with arsenious acid; if
acetic acid is present, or an acetate, a smell of kakodyl is produced.</p>

<h3>V.&mdash;Ammonia.</h3>

<p><a name="Sect_91" id="Sect_91"></a>&sect; 91. Ammonia, (<span class="chemform">NH<sub>3</sub></span>), is met with either as a vapour or gas, or as
a solution of the pure gas in water.</p>

<p><b>Properties.</b>&mdash;Pure ammonia gas is colourless, with a strong, irritating,
pungent odour, forming white fumes of ammonic chloride, if exposed to
hydric chloride vapour, and turning red moist litmus-paper strongly blue.
By intense cold, or by a pressure of 6<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> atmospheres at the ordinary temperature,
the gas is readily liquefied; the liquid ammonia boils at 38&deg;;
its observed specific gravity is &middot;731; it freezes at -57&middot;1&deg;. Ammonia
is readily absorbed by water; at 0&deg; water will take up 1000 times
its own volume, and at ordinary temperatures about 600 times its
volume. Alcohol also absorbs about 10 per cent. Ammonia is a strong
base, and forms a number of salts. Ammonia is one of the constant
products of the putrefaction of nitrogenous substances; it exists in the
atmosphere in small proportions, and in everything that contains water.
Indeed, water is the only compound equal to it in its universality of
diffusion. The minute quantities of ammonia thus diffused throughout
nature are probably never in the free state, but combinations of ammonia
with hydric nitrate, carbon dioxide, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_93" id="Sect_93"></a>&sect; 93. <b>Statistics.</b>&mdash;Falck has found throughout literature notices of
thirty cases of poisoning by ammonia, or some of its preparations. In
two of these it was used as a poison for the purpose of murder, and in
eight with suicidal intent; the remainder were all accidental. The two
criminal cases were those of children, who both died. Six out of eight
of the suicidal, and twelve of the twenty accidental cases also terminated
fatally.</p>

<p>Ammonia was the cause of 64 deaths (39 male, 25 female) by accident
and of 34 (18 male, 16 female) by suicide, making a total of 98 during
the ten years 1883-1892 in England and Wales. At present it occupies
the seventh place among poisons as a cause of accident, the ninth as a
means of suicide.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_94" id="Sect_94"></a>&sect; 94. <b>Poisoning by Ammonia Vapour.</b>&mdash;Strong ammoniacal vapour is
fatal to both animal and vegetable life. There are, however, but few
instances of poisoning by ammonia vapour; these few cases have been,
without exception, the result of accident. Two cases of death are recorded,
due to an attempt to rouse epileptics from stupor, by an injudicious
use of strong ammonia applied to the nostrils. In another case, when
hydrocyanic acid had been taken, there was the same result. An instance
is also on record of poisonous effects from the breaking of a bottle of
ammonia, and the sudden evolution in this way of an enormous volume
of the caustic gas. Lastly, a man employed in the manufacture of ice,
by means of the liquefaction of ammonia (Carr&eacute;&#8217;s process), breathed the
vapour, and had a narrow escape for his life.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_95" id="Sect_95"></a>&sect; 95. <b>Symptoms.</b>&mdash;The symptoms observed in the last case may well
serve as a type of what may be expected to occur after breathing ammonia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
vapour. The man remained from five to ten minutes in the stream of
gas; he then experienced a feeling of anxiety, and a sense of constriction
in the epigastrium, burning in the throat, and giddiness. He vomited.
The pulse was small and frequent, the face pale, the mouth and throat
strongly reddened, with increased secretion. Auscultation and percussion
of the chest elicited nothing abnormal, although during the course of four
days he had from time to time symptoms of suffocation, which were
relieved by emetics. He recovered by the eighth day.<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>In experiments on animals, very similar symptoms are produced. There
is increased secretion of the eyes, nose, and mouth, with redness. The
cry of cats becomes remarkably hoarse, and they generally vomit. Great
difficulty in breathing and tetanic convulsions are present. When the
animal is confined in a small closed chamber, death takes place in about
a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p><i>On section</i>, the bronchial tubes, to the finest ramifications, are found to
be filled with a tenacious mucus, and the air passages, from the glottis
throughout, reddened. The lungs are emphysematous, but have not
always any special colour; the heart contains but little coagulated blood;
the blood has a dark-red colour.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_96" id="Sect_96"></a>&sect; 96. The chronic effects of the gas, as shown in workmen engaged in
manufactures in which the fumes of ammonia are frequent, appear to be
an inflammation of the eyes and an affection of the skin. The latter is
thought to be due to the ammonia uniting to form a soap with the oil of
the lubricating skin glands. Some observers have also noticed deafness,
and a peculiar colour of the skin of the nose and forehead, among those
who work in guano manufactories. Its usual action on the body appears
to be a diminution of the healthy oxidation changes, and a general
lowering of bodily strength, with evident an&aelig;mia.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_97" id="Sect_97"></a>&sect; 97. <b>Ammonia in Solution.&mdash;Action on Plants.</b>&mdash;Solutions of
strong ammonia, or solutions of the carbonate, act injuriously on vegetable
life, while the neutral salts of ammonia are, on the contrary, excellent
manures. A 30 per cent. solution of ammonic carbonate kills most
plants within an hour, and it is indifferent whether the whole plant is
watered with this solution, or whether it is applied only to the leaves.
If, after this watering of the plant with ammonic carbonate water, the
injurious salt is washed out as far as possible by distilled water, or by
a weakly acidulated fluid, then the plant may recover, after having
shed more or less of its leaves. These facts sufficiently explain the
injurious effects noticed when urine is applied direct to plants, for
urine in a very short time becomes essentially a solution of ammonic
carbonate.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_98" id="Sect_98"></a>&sect; 98. <b>Action on Human Beings and Animal Life.</b>&mdash;The violence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
of the action of caustic solutions of ammonia almost entirely depends on
the state of concentration.</p>

<p>The local action of the strong solution appears to be mainly the
extraction of water and the saponifying of fat, making a soluble soap.
On delicate tissues it has, therefore, a destructive action; but S. Samuel<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
has shown that ammonia, when applied to the unbroken epidermis, does
not have the same intense action as potash or soda, nor does it coagulate
albumen. Blood, whether exposed to ammonia gas, or mixed with solution
of ammonia, becomes immediately dark-red; then, later, through
destruction of the blood corpuscles, very dark, even black; lastly, a dirty
brown-red. The oxygen is expelled, the h&aelig;moglobin destroyed, and the
blood corpuscles dissolved.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>The albumen of the blood is changed to alkali-albuminate, and the
blood itself will not coagulate. A more or less fluid condition of the
blood has always been noticed in the bodies of those poisoned by
ammonia.</p>

<p>Blood exposed to ammonia, when viewed by the spectroscope, shows
the spectra of alkaline h&aelig;matin, a weak absorption-band, in the neighbourhood
of D; but if the blood has been acted on for some time by
ammonia, then all absorption-bands vanish. These spectra, however, are
not peculiar to ammonia, the action of caustic potash or soda being
similar. The muscles are excited by ammonia, the functions of the nerves
are destroyed.</p>

<p>When a solution of strong ammonia is swallowed, there are two main
effects&mdash;(1) the action of the ammonia itself on the tissues it comes into
contact with, and (2) the effects of the vapour on the air-passages.
There are, therefore, immediate irritation, redness, and swelling of the
tongue and pharynx, a burning pain reaching from the mouth to the
stomach, with vomiting, and, it may be, nervous symptoms. The saliva
is notably increased. In a case reported by Fonssagrives,<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> no less than
3 litres were expelled in the twenty-four hours. Often the glands
under the jaw and the lymphatics of the neck are swollen.</p>

<p>Doses of from 5 to 30 grammes of the strong solution of ammonia may
kill as quickly as prussic acid. In a case recorded by Christison,<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> death
occurred in four minutes from a large dose, doubtless partly by suffocation.
As sudden a result is also recorded by Plenk: a man, bitten
by a rabid dog, took a mouthful of spirits of ammonia, and died in four
minutes.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>If death does not occur rapidly, there may be other symptoms&mdash;dependent
not upon its merely local action, but upon its more remote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
effects. These mainly consist in an excitation of the brain and spinal
cord, and, later, convulsive movements deepening into loss of consciousness.
It has been noticed that, with great relaxation of the muscular system,
the patients complain of every movement causing pain. With these
general symptoms added to the local injury, death may follow many days
after the swallowing of the fatal dose.</p>

<p>Death may also occur simply from the local injury done to the throat and
larynx, and the patient may linger some time. Thus, in a case quoted by
Taylor,<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> in which none of the poison appears actually to have been swallowed,
the man died nineteen days after taking the poison from inflammation
of the throat and larynx. As with the strong acids, so with
ammonia and the alkalies generally, death may also be caused many
weeks and even months afterwards from the effects of contraction of the
gullet, or from the impaired nutrition consequent upon the destruction,
more or less, of portions of the stomach or intestinal canal.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<div class="footnote">

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p><a name="Sect_99" id="Sect_99"></a>&sect; 99. <b>Post-mortem Appearances.</b>&mdash;In recent cases there is an
intense redness of the intestinal canal, from the mouth to the stomach,
and even beyond, with here and there destruction of the mucous membrane,
and even perforation. A wax preparation in the museum of
University College (No. 2378) shows the effects on the stomach produced
by swallowing strong ammonia; it is ashen-gray in colour, and most of
the mucous membrane is, as it were, dissolved away; the cardiac end is
much congested.</p>

<p>The contents of the stomach are usually coloured with blood; the
bronchial tubes and glottis are almost constantly found inflamed&mdash;even a
croup-like (or diphtheritic) condition has been seen. &#338;dema of the glottis
should also be looked for: in one case this alone seems to have accounted
for death. The blood is of a clear-red colour, and fluid. A smell of
ammonia may be present.</p>

<p>If a sufficient time has elapsed for secondary effects to take place, then
there may be other appearances. Thus, in the case of a girl who, falling
into a fainting fit, was treated with a draught of undiluted spirits of
ammonia, and lived four weeks afterwards, the stomach (preserved in
St. George&#8217;s Hospital museum, 43 b, ser. ix.) is seen to be much dilated
and covered with cicatrices, and the pylorus is so contracted as hardly to
admit a small bougie. It has also been noticed that there is generally a
fatty degeneration of both the kidneys and liver.</p>

<p>It need scarcely be observed that, in such cases, no free ammonia will
be found, and the question of the cause of death must necessarily be
wholly medical and pathological.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_100" id="Sect_100"></a>&sect; 100. <b>Separation of Ammonia.</b>&mdash;Ammonia is separated in all cases
by distillation, and if the organic or other liquid is already alkaline,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
it is at once placed in a retort and distilled. If neutral or acid, a little
burnt magnesia may be added until the reaction is alkaline. It is generally
laid down that the contents of the stomach in a putrid condition
cannot be examined for ammonia, because ammonia is already present as
a product of decomposition; but even under these circumstances it is
possible to give an opinion whether ammonia <i>in excess</i> is present. For
if, after carefully mixing the whole contents of the stomach, and then
drying a portion and reckoning from that weight the total nitrogen
(considering, for this purpose, the contents to consist wholly of albumen,
which yields about 16 per cent. of nitrogen)&mdash;under these conditions, the
contents of the stomach yield more than 16 per cent. of nitrogen as
ammonia reckoned on the dry substance, it is tolerably certain that
ammonia not derived from the food or the tissues is present.</p>

<p>If, also, there is a sufficient evolution of ammonia to cause white fumes,
when a rod moistened with hydrochloric acid is brought near to the
liquid, this is an effect never noticed with a normal decomposition, and
renders the presence of extrinsic ammonia probable.</p>

<p>An alkaline-reacting distillate, which gives a brown colour with the
&#8220;nessler&#8221; reagent, and which, when carefully neutralised with sulphuric
acid, on evaporation to dryness by the careful heat of a water-bath,
leaves a crystalline mass that gives a copious precipitate with
platinic chloride, but is hardly at all soluble in absolute alcohol, can
be no other substance than ammonia.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_101" id="Sect_101"></a>&sect; 101. <b>Estimation.</b>&mdash;Ammonia is most quickly estimated by distilling,
receiving the distillate in decinormal acid, and then titrating back.
It may also be estimated as the double chloride of ammonium and platinum
<span class="chemform">(NH<sub>4</sub>Cl)<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>4</sub></span>. The distillate is exactly neutralised by <span class="chemform">HCl</span>,
evaporated to near dryness, and an alcoholic solution of platinic chloride
added in sufficient quantity to be always in slight excess, as shown by
the yellow colour of the supernatant fluid. The precipitate is collected,
washed with a little alcohol, dried, and weighed on a tared filter; 100
parts of the salt are equal to 7&middot;6 of <span class="chemform">NH<sub>3</sub></span>.</p>

<h3>VI.&mdash;Caustic Potash and Soda.</h3>

<p><a name="Sect_102" id="Sect_102"></a>&sect; 102. There is so little difference in the local effects produced by
potash and soda respectively, that it will be convenient to treat them
together.</p>

<p><b>Potash</b> (<b>potassa caustica</b>).&mdash;Hydrate of potassium (<span class="chemform">KHO</span>), atomic
weight 56, specific gravity 2&middot;1.</p>

<p><b>Properties.</b>&mdash;Pure hydrate of potassium is a compact, white solid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
usually met with in the form of sticks. When heated to a temperature
a little under redness, it melts to a nearly colourless liquid; in this state
it is intensely corrosive. It rapidly absorbs moisture from the air, and
moist potash also absorbs with great avidity carbon dioxide; it is powerfully
alkaline, changing red litmus to blue. It is soluble in half its
weight of cold water, great heat being evolved during solution; it forms
two definite hydrates&mdash;one, <span class="chemform">KHO</span> + <span class="chemform">H<sub>2</sub>O</span>; the other, <span class="chemform">KHO</span> + <span class="chemform">2H<sub>2</sub>O</span>. It
is sparingly soluble in ether, but is dissolved by alcohol, wood-spirit, fusel
oil, and glycerin.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_103" id="Sect_103"></a>&sect; 103. <b>Pharmaceutical Preparations.</b>&mdash;Potassium hydrate, as well as
the solution of potash, is officinal in all pharmacop&#339;ias. The <i>liquor
potass&aelig;</i>, or solution of potash, of the British Pharmacop&#339;ia, is a strongly
alkaline, caustic liquid, of 1&middot;058 specific gravity, and containing
5&middot;84 per cent. by weight of <span class="chemform">KHO</span>. It should, theoretically, not effervesce,
when treated with an acid, but its affinity for <span class="chemform">CO<sub>2</sub></span> is so great that all
solutions of potash, which have been in any way exposed to air, contain
a little carbonate. Caustic sticks of potash and lime used to be officinal
in the British Pharmacop&#339;ia. Filho&#8217;s caustic is still in commerce, and is
made by melting together two parts of potassium hydrate and one part
of lime in an iron ladle or vessel; the melted mass is now moulded by
pouring it into leaden moulds. Vienna paste is composed of equal
weights of potash and lime made into a paste with rectified spirit or
glycerin.</p>

form of small white crystalline grains, alkaline in taste and reaction,
and rapidly deliquescing when exposed to moist air; it gives all the
chemical reactions of potassium oxide, and carbon dioxide. Carbonate of
potash, under the name of <i>salt of tartar</i>, or potashes, is sold by oilmen
for cleansing purposes. They supply it either in a fairly pure state, or as
a darkish moist mass containing many impurities.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_105" id="Sect_105"></a>&sect; 105. <b>Bicarbonate of Potash</b> (<span class="chemform">KHCO<sub>3</sub></span>) is in the form of large
transparent rhombic prisms, and is not deliquescent. The effervescing
solution of potash (<i>liquor potass&aelig; effervescens</i>) consists of 30 grains of
<span class="chemform">KHCO<sub>3</sub></span> in a pint of water (3&middot;45 grms. per litre), and as much <span class="chemform">CO<sub>2</sub></span> as the
water will take up under a pressure of seven atmospheres.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_106" id="Sect_106"></a>&sect; 106. <b>Caustic Soda&mdash;Sodium Hydrate</b> (<span class="chemform">NaHO</span>).&mdash;This substance
is a white solid, very similar in appearance to potassium hydrate;
it absorbs moisture from the air, and afterwards carbon dioxide, becoming
solid again, for the carbonate is not deliquescent. In this respect,
then, there is a great difference between potash and soda, for the former
is deliquescent both as hydrate and carbonate; a stick of potash in a semi-liquid
state, by exposure to the air, continues liquid, although saturated
with carbon dioxide. Pure sodium hydrate has a specific gravity of 2&middot;0;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
it dissolves in water with evolution of heat, and the solution gives all the
reactions of sodium hydrate, and absorbs carbon dioxide as readily as the

contain 4&middot;1 per cent. of <span class="chemform">NaHO</span>.</p>

pure carbonate of soda for medicinal use is in colourless and transparent
rhombic octahedrons; when exposed to air, the crystals effloresce
and crumble. The <i>sod&aelig; carbonas exsiccata</i>, or dried carbonate of soda, is
simply the ordinary carbonate, deprived of its water of crystallisation,
which amounts to 62&middot;93 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_108" id="Sect_108"></a>&sect; 108. <b>Bicarbonate of Soda</b> (<span class="chemform">NaHCO<sub>3</sub></span>) occurs in the form of minute
crystals, or, more commonly, as a white powder. The <i>liquor sod&aelig; effervescens</i>
of the B.P. is a solution of the bicarbonate, 30 grains of the
salt in 20 ozs. of water (3&middot;45 grms. per litre), the water being charged
with as much carbonic acid as it will hold under a pressure of seven
atmospheres. <i>The bicarbonate of soda lozenges</i> (<i>trochisci sod&aelig; bicarbonatis</i>)
contain in each lozenge 5 grains (327 mgrms.) of the bicarbonate. The
carbonate of soda sold for household purposes is of two kinds&mdash;the one,
&#8220;seconds,&#8221; of a dirty white colour and somewhat impure; the other,
&#8220;best,&#8221; is a white mass of much greater purity. <i>Javelle water</i> (<i>Eau de
Javelle</i>) is a solution of hypochlorite of soda; its action is poisonous, more
from the caustic alkali than from the chlorine, and may, therefore, be
here included.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_109" id="Sect_109"></a>&sect; 109. <b>Statistics.</b>&mdash;Poisoning by the fixed alkalies is not so frequent
as poisoning by ammonia. Falck has collected, from medical literature,
27 cases, 2 of which were the criminal administering of <i>Eau de Javelle</i>,
and 5 were suicidal; 22, or 81&middot;5 per cent., died&mdash;in 1 of the cases after
twenty-four hours; in the others, life was prolonged for days, weeks,
or months&mdash;in 1 case for twenty-seven months. In the ten years
1883-1892, in England and Wales, there were 27 deaths from poisoning
by the fixed alkalies; 2 were suicidal (1 from potash, the other from
soda); the remaining 25 were due to accident; of these, 7 (3 males and
4 females) were from caustic soda, and 18 (8 males and 10 females)
from caustic potash.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_110" id="Sect_110"></a>&sect; 110. <b>Effects on Animal and Vegetable Life.</b>&mdash;The fixed alkalies
destroy all vegetable life, if applied in strong solution or in substance,
by dehydrating and dissolving the tissues. The effects on animal
tissues are, in part, due also to the affinity of the alkalies for water.
They extract water from the tissues with which they come in contact, and
also attack the albuminous constituents, forming alkali-albuminate, which
swells on the addition of water, and, in a large quantity, even dissolves.
Cartilaginous and horny tissues are also acted upon, and strong alkalies
will dissolve hair, silk, &amp;c. The action of the alkali is by no means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
restricted to the part first touched, but has a remarkable faculty of
spreading in all directions.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_111" id="Sect_111"></a>&sect; 111. <b>Local Effects.</b>&mdash;The effects of strong alkali applied to the epidermis
are similar to, but not identical with, those produced by strong
acids. S. Samuel<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> has studied this experimentally on the ear of the
rabbit; a drop of a strong solution of caustic alkali, placed on the ear of
a white rabbit, caused stasis in the arteries and veins, with first a greenish,
then a black colour of the blood; the epidermis was bleached, the hair
loosened, and there quickly followed a greenish coloration on the back of
the ear, opposite to the place of application. Around the burned spot
appeared a circle of anastomising vessels, a blister rose, and a slough separated
in a few days. The whole thickness of the ear was coloured
yellowish-green, and, later, the spot became of a rusty brown.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_112" id="Sect_112"></a>&sect; 112. <b>Symptoms.</b>&mdash;The symptoms observed when a person has
swallowed a dangerous dose of caustic (fixed) alkali are very similar to
those noticed with ammonia, with the important exception that there is
no respiratory trouble, unless the liquid has come into contact with the
glottis; nor has there been hitherto remarked the rapid death which
has taken place in a few ammonia poisonings, the shortest time hitherto
recorded being three hours, as related by Taylor, in a case in which a boy
had swallowed 3 ozs. of a strong solution of carbonate of potash.</p>

<p>There is instant pain, extending from the mouth to the stomach, and
a persistent and unpleasant taste; if the individual is not a determined
suicide, and the poison (as is mostly the case) has been taken accidentally,
the liquid is immediately ejected as much as possible, and water, or other
liquid at hand, drunk freely. Shock may at once occur, and the patient
die from collapse; but this, even with frightful destruction of tissue,
appears to be rare. Vomiting supervenes; what is ejected is strongly
alkaline, and streaked with blood, and has a soapy, frothy appearance.
There may be diarrh&#339;a, great tenderness of the abdomen, and quick
pulse and fever. With caustic potash, there may be also noticed its
toxic effects (apart from local action) on the heart; the pulse, in that
case, is slow and weak, and loss of consciousness and convulsions are not
uncommon. If the collapse and after-inflammation are recovered from,
then, as in the case of the mineral acids, there is all the horrid sequence
of symptoms pointing to contractions and strictures of the gullet or
pylorus, and the subsequent dyspepsia, difficulty of swallowing, and not
unfrequently actual starvation.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_113" id="Sect_113"></a>&sect; 113. <b>Post-mortem Appearances.</b>&mdash;In cases of recent poisoning, spots
on the cheeks, lips, clothing, &amp;c., giving evidence of the contact of the
alkali, should be looked for; but this evidence, in the case of persons who
have lived a few days, may be wanting. The mucous membrane of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
mouth, throat, gullet, and stomach is generally more or less white&mdash;here
and there denuded, and will be found in various stages of inflammation
and erosion, according to the amount taken, and the concentration of the
alkali. Where there is erosion, the base of the eroded parts is not brown-yellow,
but, as a rule, pale red. The gullet is most affected at its lower
part, and it is this part which is mostly subject to stricture. Thus B&ouml;hm<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
found that in 18 cases of contraction of the gullet, collected by him, 10 of
the 18 showed the contraction at the lower third.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>The changes which the stomach may present if the patient has lived
some time, are well illustrated by a preparation in St. George&#8217;s museum
(43 a. 264, ser. ix.). It is the stomach of a woman, aged 44, who had
swallowed a concentrated solution of carbonate of potash. She vomited
immediately after taking it, and lived about two months, during the
latter part of which she had to be nourished by injections. She died
mainly from starvation. The gullet in its lower part is seen to be much
contracted, its lining membrane destroyed, and the muscular coats exposed.
The coats of the stomach are thickened, but what chiefly arrests the
attention is a dense cicatrix at the pylorus, with an aperture so small as
only to admit a probe.</p>

<p>The colour of the stomach is generally bright red, but in that of a child,
preserved in Guy&#8217;s Hospital museum (No. 1798<sup>24</sup>), the mucous membrane
is obliterated, the rug&aelig; destroyed, and a dark-brown stain is a noticeable
feature. The stomach is not, however, necessarily affected. In a preparation
in the same museum (No. 1798<sup>20</sup>) the mucous membrane of the
stomach of a child who swallowed soap-lees is seen to be almost healthy,
but the gullet is much discoloured. The action on the blood is to
change it into a gelatinous mass; the blood corpuscles are destroyed,
and the whole colour becomes of a dirty blackish-red; the spectroscopic
appearances are identical with those already described (see <a href="#Page_114">p. 114</a>).</p>

<p>The question as to the effects of chronic poisoning by the alkalies
or their carbonates may arise. Little or nothing is, however, known
of the action of considerable quantities of alkalies taken daily. In
a case related by Dr. Tunstall,<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> a man for eighteen years had taken
daily 2 ozs. of bicarbonate of soda for the purpose of relieving
indigestion. He died suddenly, and the stomach was found extensively
diseased; but since the man, before taking the alkali, had
complained of pain, &amp;c., it is hardly well, from this one case, to draw
any conclusion.</p>

<p>It is important to observe that the contents of the stomach may be
acid, although the death has been produced by caustic alkali. A child,
aged 4, drank from a cup some 14 per cent. soda lye. He vomited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
frequently, and died in fifteen hours. The stomach contained 80 c.c. of
sour-smelling turbid fluid, the reaction of which was acid. There were
h&aelig;morrhagic patches in the stomach, and signs of catarrhal inflammation;
there was also a similarly inflamed condition of the duodenum.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p><a name="Sect_114" id="Sect_114"></a>&sect; 114. <b>Chemical Analysis.</b>&mdash;The tests for potassium or sodium are
too well known to need more than enumeration. The intense yellow
flame produced when a sodium salt is submitted to a Bunsen flame, and
the bright sodium-line at D when viewed by the spectroscope, is a delicate
test; while potassium gives a dull red band in the red, and a faint but
very distinct line in the violet. Potassium salts are precipitated by tartaric
acid, while sodium salts do not yield this precipitate; potassium
salts also give a precipitate with platinic chloride insoluble in strong
alcohol, while the compound salt with sodium is rapidly dissolved by
alcohol or water. This fact is utilised in the separation and estimation
of the two alkalies.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_115" id="Sect_115"></a>&sect; 115. <b>Estimation of the Fixed Alkalies.</b>&mdash;To detect a fixed
alkali in the contents of the stomach, a convenient process is to proceed
by dialysis, and after twenty-four hours, to concentrate the outer liquid
by boiling, and then, if it is not too much coloured, to titrate directly
with a decinormal sulphuric acid. After exact neutralisation, the liquid
is evaporated to dryness, carbonised, the alkaline salts lixiviated out with
water, the sulphuric acid exactly precipitated by baric chloride, and then,
after separation of the sulphate, the liquid treated with milk of lime.
The filtrate is treated with a current of <span class="chemform">CO<sub>2</sub></span> gas, boiled, and any precipitate
filtered off; the final filtrate will contain only alkalies. The
liquid may now be evaporated to dryness with either hydrochloric or
sulphuric acids, and the total alkalies weighed as sulphates or chlorides.
Should it be desirable to know exactly the proportion of potassium to
sodium, it is best to convert the alkalies into chlorides&mdash;dry gently,
ignite, and weigh; then dissolve in the least possible quantity of water,
and precipitate by platinic chloride, which should be added so as to be a
little in excess, but not much. The liquid thus treated is evaporated
nearly to dryness, and then extracted with alcohol of 80 per cent., which
dissolves out any of the double chloride of platinum and sodium. Finally,
the precipitate is collected on a tared filter and weighed, after drying at
100&deg;. In this way the analyst both distinguishes between the salts of
sodium and potassium, and estimates the relative quantities of each. It
is hardly necessary to observe that, if the double chloride is wholly
soluble in water or alcohol, sodium alone is present. This, however, will
never occur in operating on organic tissues and fluids, for both alkalies
are invariably present. A correction must be made when complex organic
fluids are in this way treated for alkalies which may be naturally in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
fluid. Here the analyst will be guided by his preliminary titration,
which gives the total free alkalinity. In cases where the alkali has been
neutralised by acids, of course no free alkali will be found, but the corresponding
salt.</p>

<h3>VII.&mdash;Neutral Sodium, Potassium, and Ammonium Salts.</h3>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><a name="Sect_116" id="Sect_116"></a>&sect; 116. The neutral salts of the alkalies are poisonous, if administered in sufficient
doses, and the poisonous effect of the sulphate, chloride, bromide, iodide, tartrate,
and citrate appears to depend on the specific action of the alkali metal, rather than
on the acid, or halogen in combination. According to the researches of Dr. Ringer
and Dr. Harrington Sainsbury,<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize110">[126]</span></a> with regard to the relative toxicity of the three, as
shown by their effect on the heart of a frog&mdash;first, the potassium salts were found to
exert the most poisonous action, next come the ammonium, and, lastly, the sodium
salts. The highest estimate would be that sodium salts are only one-tenth as
poisonous as those of ammonium or potassium; the lowest, that the sodium salts
are one-fifth: although the experiments mainly throw light upon the action of the
alkalies on one organ only, yet the indications obtained probably hold good for the
organism as a whole, and are pretty well borne out by clinical experience.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>There appear to be four cases on record of poisoning by the above neutral salts;
none of them belong to recent times, but lie between the years 1837-1856. Hence,
the main knowledge which we possess of the poisonous action of the potassium salts
is derived from experiments on animals.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_117" id="Sect_117"></a>&sect; 117. <b>Sodium Salts.</b>&mdash;Common salt in such enormous quantity as half a pound
to a pound has destroyed human life, but these cases are so exceptional that the
poisonous action of sodium salts is of scientific rather than practical interest.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_118" id="Sect_118"></a>&sect; 118. <b>Potassium Salts.</b>&mdash;Leaving for future consideration the nitrate and the
chlorate of potassium, potassic sulphate and tartrate are substances which have
destroyed human life.</p>

<p><b>Potassic Sulphate</b> (<span class="chemform">K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub></span>) is in the form of colourless rhombic crystals, of bitter
saline taste. It is soluble in 10 parts of water.</p>

<p><b>Hydropotassic Tartrate</b> (<span class="chemform">KHC<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub></span>), when pure, is in the form of rhombic
crystals, tasting feebly acid. It is soluble in 210 parts of water at 17&deg;.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_119" id="Sect_119"></a>&sect; 119. <b>Action on the Frog&#8217;s Heart.</b>&mdash;Both excitability and contractility are
affected to a powerful degree. There is a remarkable slowing of the pulsations,
irregularity, and, lastly, cessation of pulsation altogether.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_120" id="Sect_120"></a>&sect; 120. <b>Action on Warm-Blooded Animals.</b>&mdash;If a sufficient quantity of a
solution of a potassic salt is injected into the blood-vessels of an animal, there is
almost immediate death from arrest of the heart&#8217;s action. Smaller doses, subcutaneously
applied, produce slowing of the pulse, dyspn&#339;a, and convulsions, ending
in death. Small doses produce a transitory diminution of the force of arterial
pressure, which quickly passes, and the blood-pressure rises. There is at first, for
a few seconds, increase in the number of pulsations, but later a remarkable slowing
of the pulse. The rise in the blood-pressure occurs even after section of the spinal
cord. Somewhat larger doses cause rapid lowering of the blood-pressure, and apparent
cessation of the heart&#8217;s action; but if the thorax be then opened, the heart is seen
to be contracting regularly, making some 120-160 rhythmic movements in the
minute. If the respiration be now artificially maintained, and suitable pressure
made on the walls of the chest, so as to empty the heart of blood, the blood-pressure
quickly rises, and natural respiration may follow. An animal which lay thirty-six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"><span class="fsize110">[123]</span></a></span>
minutes apparently dead was in this way brought to life again (<i>B&ouml;hm</i>). The action
of the salts of potassium on the blood is the same as that of sodium salts. The blood
is coloured a brighter red, and the form of the corpuscles changed; they become
shrivelled through loss of water. Voluntary muscle loses quickly its contractility
when a solution of potash is injected into its vessels. Nerves also, when treated
with a 1 per cent. solution of potassic chloride, become inexcitable.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_121" id="Sect_121"></a>&sect; 121. <b>Elimination.</b>&mdash;The potassium salts appear to leave the body through the
kidneys, but are excreted much more slowly than the corresponding sodium salts.
Thus, after injection of 4 grms. of potassic chloride&mdash;in the first sixteen hours
&middot;748 grm. of <span class="chemform">KCl</span> was excreted in the urine, and in the following twenty-four hours
2&middot;677 grms.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_122" id="Sect_122"></a>&sect; 122. <b>Nitrate of Potash</b> (<span class="chemform">KNO<sub>3</sub></span>).&mdash;Pure potassic nitrate crystallises in large anhydrous
hexagonal prisms with dihedral summits; it does not absorb water, and does
not deliquesce. Its fusing point is about 340&deg;; when melted it forms a transparent
liquid, and loses a little of its oxygen, but this is for the most part retained by the
liquid given off when the salt solidifies. At a red-heat it evolves oxygen, and
is reduced first to nitrite; if the heat is continued, potassic oxide remains. The
specific gravity of the fused salt is 2&middot;06. It is not very soluble in cold water, 100
parts dissolving only 26 at 15&middot;6&deg;; but boiling water dissolves it freely, 100 parts
dissolving 240 of the salt.</p>

<p>A solution of nitrate of potash, when treated with a zinc couple (see &#8220;Foods,&#8221;
p. 566), is decomposed, the nitrate being first reduced to nitrite, as shown by its
striking a red colour with metaphenylene-diamine, and then the nitrite farther
decomposing, and ammonia appearing in the liquid. If the solution is alkalised,
and treated with aluminium foil, hydrogen is evolved, and the same effect produced.
As with all nitrates, potassic nitrate, on being heated in a test-tube with
a little water, some copper filings, and sulphuric acid, evolves red fumes of nitric
peroxide.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_123" id="Sect_123"></a>&sect; 123. <b>Statistics.</b>&mdash;Potassic nitrate, under the popular name of &#8220;<i>nitre</i>,&#8221; is a
very common domestic remedy, and is also largely used as a medicine for cattle.
There appear to be twenty cases of potassic nitrate poisoning on record&mdash;of these,
eight were caused by the salts having been accidentally mistaken for magnesic
sulphate, sodic sulphate, or other purgative salt; two cases were due to a similar
mistake for common salt. In one instance, the nitrate was used in strong solution
as an enema, but most of the cases were due to the taking of too large an internal
dose.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_124" id="Sect_124"></a>&sect; 124. <b>Uses in the Arts</b>, &amp;c.&mdash;Both sodic and potassic nitrates are called &#8220;nitre&#8221;
by the public indiscriminately. Sodic nitrate is imported in large quantities
from the rainless districts of Peru as a manure. Potassic nitrate is much used
in the manufacture of gunpowder, in the preservation of animal substances, in the
manufacture of gun cotton, of sulphuric and nitric acids, &amp;c. The maximum medicinal
dose of potassium nitrate is usually stated to be 30 grains (1&middot;9 grm.).</p>

<p><a name="Sect_125" id="Sect_125"></a>&sect; 125. <b>Action of Nitrates of Sodium and Potassium.</b>&mdash;Both of these salts
are poisonous. Potassic nitrate has been taken with fatal result by man; the
poisonous nature of sodic nitrate is established by experiments on animals. The
action of the nitrates of the alkalies is separated from that of the other neutral salts
of potassium, &amp;c., because in this case the toxic action of the combined nitric acid
plays no insignificant part. Large doses, 3-5 grms. (46&middot;3-77&middot;2 grains), of potassic
nitrate cause considerable uneasiness in the stomach and bowels; the digestion is
disturbed; there may be vomiting and diarrh&#339;a, and there is generally present a
desire to urinate frequently. Still larger doses, 15-30 grms. (231&middot;5-463 grains),
rapidly produce all the symptoms of acute gastro-enteritis&mdash;great pain, frequent
vomiting (the ejected matters being often bloody), with irregularity and slowing of
the pulse; weakness, cold sweats, painful cramps in single muscles (especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"><span class="fsize110">[124]</span></a></span>
in the calves of the legs); and, later, convulsions, aphonia, quick collapse, and
death.</p>

<p>In the case of a pregnant woman, a handful of &#8220;nitre&#8221; taken in mistake for
Glauber&#8217;s salts produced abortion after half-an-hour. The woman recovered. Sodic
nitrate subcutaneously applied to frogs kills them, in doses of &middot;026 grm. (&middot;4 grain),
in about two hours; there are fibrillar twitchings of single groups of muscles and
narcosis. The heart dies last, but after ceasing to beat may, by a stimulus, be made
again to contract. Rabbits, poisoned similarly by sodic nitrate, exhibit also narcotic
symptoms; they lose consciousness, lie upon their side, and respond only to the
sharpest stimuli. The breathing, as well as the heart, is &#8220;slowed,&#8221; and death
follows after a few spasmodic inspirations.</p>

<p><b>Sodic nitrite</b> was found by Barth to be a more powerful poison, less than 6
mgrms. (&middot;1 grain) being sufficient to kill a rabbit of 455&middot;5 grms. (7028 grains) weight,
when subcutaneously injected. The symptoms were very similar to those produced
by the nitrate.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_126" id="Sect_126"></a>&sect; 126. The <i>post-mortem</i> appearances from potassic nitrate are as follows:&mdash;An
inflamed condition of the stomach, with the mucous membrane dark in colour, and
readily tearing; the contents of the stomach are often mixed with blood. In a case
related by Orfila, there was even a small perforation by a large dose of potassic
nitrate, and a remarkable preservation of the body was noted.</p>

<p>It is believed that the action of the nitrates is to be partly explained by a reduction
to nitrites, circulating in the blood as such. To detect nitrites in the blood,
the best method is to place the blood in a dialyser, the outer liquid being alcohol.
The alcoholic solution may be evaporated to dryness, extracted with water, and then
tested by metaphenylene-diamine.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_127" id="Sect_127"></a>&sect; 127. <b>Potassic Chlorate</b> (<span class="chemform">KClO<sub>3</sub></span>).&mdash;Potassic chlorate is in the form of colourless,
tabular crystals with four or six sides. About 6 parts of the salt are dissolved
by 100 of water at 15&deg;, the solubility increasing with the temperature, so that at
100&deg; nearly 60 parts dissolve; if strong sulphuric acid be dropped on the crystals,
peroxide of chlorine is evolved; when rubbed with sulphur in a mortar, potassic
chlorate detonates. When the salt is heated strongly, it first melts, and then
decomposes, yielding oxygen gas, and is transformed into the perchlorate. If the
heat is continued, this also is decomposed, and the final result is potassic chloride.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_128" id="Sect_128"></a>&sect; 128. <b>Uses.</b>&mdash;Potassic chlorate is largely used as an oxidiser in calico printing,
and in dyeing, especially in the preparation of aniline black. A considerable
quantity is consumed in the manufacture of lucifer matches and fireworks; it is also
a convenient source of oxygen. Detonators for exploding dynamite are mixtures of
fulminate of mercury and potassic chlorate. It is employed as a medicine both as
an application to inflamed mucous membranes, and for internal administration;
about 2000 tons of the salt for these various purposes are manufactured yearly in the
United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_129" id="Sect_129"></a>&sect; 129. <b>Poisonous Properties.</b>&mdash;The facility with which potassic chlorate parts
with its oxygen by the aid of heat, led to its very extensive employment in
medicine. No drug, indeed, has been given more recklessly, or on a less scientific
basis. Wherever there were sloughing wounds, low fevers, and malignant sore
throats, especially those of a diphtheritic character, the practitioner administered
potassic chlorate in colossal doses. If the patient died, it was ascribed to the
malignity of the disease&mdash;if he recovered, to the oxygen of the salt; and it is
possible, from the light which of recent years has been thrown on the action of
potassic chlorate, that its too reckless use has led to many unrecorded accidents.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_130" id="Sect_130"></a>&sect; 130. <b>Experiments on Animals.</b>&mdash;F. Marchand<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize110">[127]</span></a> has studied the effects of
potassic chlorate on animals, and on blood. If either potassic chlorate or sodic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"><span class="fsize110">[125]</span></a></span>
chlorate is mixed with fresh blood, it shows after a little while peculiar changes;
the clear red colour at first produced passes, within a few hours, into a dark red-brown,
which gradually becomes pure brown. This change is produced by a 1 per
cent. solution, in from fifteen to sixteen hours; and a 4 per cent. solution at 15&deg;
destroys every trace of oxyh&aelig;moglobin within four hours. Soon the blood takes a
syrupy consistence, and, with a 2-4 per cent. solution of the salt, passes into a jelly-like
mass. The jelly has much permanence, and resists putrefactive changes for a
long time.</p>

<p>Marchand fed a dog of 17 kilos. in weight with 5 grms. of potassic chlorate for a
week. As there were no apparent symptoms, the dose was doubled for two days;
and as there was still no visible effect, lastly, 50 grms. of sodic chlorate were given in
5 doses. In the following night the dog died. The blood was found after death to
be of a sepia-brown colour, and remained unaltered when exposed to the air. The
organs were generally of an unnatural brown colour; the spleen was enormously
enlarged; the kidneys were swollen, and of a dark chocolate brown&mdash;on section,
almost black-brown, the colour being nearly equal, both in the substance and in the
capsule. A microscopical examination of the kidney showed the canaliculi to be
filled with brownish cylinders consisting of altered blood. A spectroscopic examination
of the blood showed weak h&aelig;moglobin bands, and a narrow band in the red.
With farther dilution, the h&aelig;moglobin bands vanished, but the band in the red
remained. The diluted blood, when exposed to the light, still remained of a
coffee-brown colour; and on shaking, a white-brown froth was produced on the
surface.</p>

<p>A second experiment in which a hound of from 7-8 kilos. in weight was given 3-5
grm. doses of potassic chlorate in sixteen hours, and killed by bleeding seven to
eight hours after the last dose, showed very similar appearances. The kidneys were

five and a half hours after taking the first dose; there were vomiting and diarrh&#339;a.
Cousin took the medicine in seven hours; the symptoms also commenced after the
last spoonful, and the death took place eight and a half hours from the first spoonful.
The symptoms were mainly those of great depression; the lips were blue, the pulse
feeble, there was no vomiting, no diarrh&#339;a. Salmont took the medicine in nine
hours, and died in twelve. There was some diarrh&#339;a, the stools were of a green
colour. Gu&eacute;rin took the whole in two hours, the symptoms commenced in four
hours; the lips were very pale, the gums blue. Death took place in four days.</p>

<p>There was an autopsy in the case of David only. The stomach showed a large
ecchymosis on its mucous membrane, as if it had been burnt by an acid; the spleen
was gorged with blood, and its tissue friable; the kidneys do not seem to have been
thoroughly examined, but are said to have been tumefied.  Potassic chlorate was
discovered by dialysis. In the cases of the children just detailed, the symptoms
appear to be a mixture of the depressing action of the potassium, and irritant action
of the chlorate.</p>

fatal is one in which an infant three years old was killed by 3 grms. (46&middot;3 grains).</p>

out of the body unchanged, and, lately, Isambert, in conjunction with Hirne,<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize110">[130]</span></a>

and a half afterwards. At that time 17&middot;23 per cent. of the salt had been excreted,
and, by the end of eleven hours, 93&middot;8 per cent. was recovered. It is then difficult
to believe that the salt gives any oxygen to the tissues, for though it is true that in
all the investigations a small percentage remains to be accounted for, and also that

the chlorate is rapidly reduced, and is no longer recognisable as chlorate&mdash;yet it
may be affirmed that potassic chlorate is recovered from the urine as completely as
anything which is ever excreted by the body, and that deductions drawn from the
changes undergone by the salt in solutions of fibrin, &amp;c., have only an indirect bearing
on the question.</p>

change in the blood, acting on the colouring matter and corpuscles; the latter lose
their property as oxygen carriers; the h&aelig;moglobin is in part destroyed; the corpuscles
dissolved. The decomposed and altered blood-corpuscles are crowded into
the kidneys, spleen, &amp;c.; they block up the uriniferous canaliculi, and thus the

<h4>Detection and Estimation of Potassic Chlorate.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><a name="Sect_135" id="Sect_135"></a>&sect; 135. Organic fluids are best submitted to dialysis; the dialysed fluid should
then be concentrated and qualitative tests applied. One of the best tests for the
presence of a chlorate is, without doubt, that recommended by Fresenius. The fluid
to be tested is acidulated with a few drops of sulphuric acid; sulphate of indigo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"><span class="fsize110">[127]</span></a></span>
added sufficient to colour the solution blue, and finally a few drops of sulphurous
acid. In presence of potassic or sodic chlorate, the blue colour immediately vanishes.
This method is capable of detecting 1 part in 128,000; provided the solution is not
originally coloured, and but little organic matter is present.</p>

<p>The urine can be examined direct, but if it contain albumen, the blue colour may
disappear and yet chlorate be present; if too much sulphurous acid be also added,
the test may give erroneous results. These are but trivial objections, however, for
if the analyst obtains a response to the test, he will naturally confirm or disprove it
by the following process:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The liquid under examination, organic or otherwise, is divided into two equal
parts. In the one, all the chlorine present is precipitated as chloride by silver
nitrate in the usual way, and the chloride of silver collected and weighed. In the
other, the liquid is evaporated to dryness and well charred by a dull red heat, the
ash dissolved in weak nitric acid, and the chlorides estimated as in the first case. If
chlorates were present, there will be a difference between the two estimations, proportionate
to the amount of chlorates which have been converted into chlorides by
the carbonisation, and the first silver chloride subtracted from the second will give
an argentic chloride which is to be referred to chlorate. In this way also the amount
present may be quantitatively estimated, 100 parts of silver chloride equalling 85&middot;4
of potassic chlorate.</p>

<h4>Toxicological Detection of Alkali Salts.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">(See also <i>ante</i>, <a href="#Page_121">p. 121</a>.)</p>

<p><a name="Sect_136" id="Sect_136"></a>&sect; 136. Sodium, in combination, especially with chlorine, and also with sulphuric,
carbonic, and phosphoric acids, is found in the plasma of the blood, in the urinary
secretion, in the pancreatic juice, in human bile, and in serous transudations, &amp;c.
Potassium, in combination, is especially found in the red blood-corpuscles, in the
muscles, in the nervous tissues, and in milk. Ammonia, in combination with acids,
is naturally found in the stomach, in the contents of the intestine; it is also a
natural constituent of the blood in small traces, and in a corpse is copiously evolved
from putrefactive changes.</p>

<p>It hence follows, that mere qualitative tests for these elements in the tissues or
fluids of the body are of not the slightest use, for they are always present during the
life of the healthiest individual, and can be found after death in persons dying from
any malady whatever. To establish the fact of a person having taken an unusual
dose of any of the alkali salts, by simply chemical evidence, it must be proved that
the alkalies are present in unusual quantities or in an abnormal state of combination.</p>

<p>In cases of rapid death, caused by sodic or potassic salts, they will be found in
such quantity in the contents of the stomach, or in matters vomited, that there will
probably be no difficulty in coming to a direct conclusion; but if some time has
elapsed, the analyst may not find a sufficient ground for giving a decided judgment,
the excretion of the alkali salts being very rapid.</p>

<p>In most cases, it will be well to proceed as follows:&mdash;The contents of the stomach
are, if necessary, diluted with distilled water, and divided into three parts, one of
which is submitted to dialysis, and then the dialysed liquid evaporated to a small
bulk and examined qualitatively, in order to ascertain whether a large amount of
the alkaline salts is present, and in what form. In this way, the presence or absence
of nitrate of potassium or sodium may be proved, or the iodide, bromide, sulphate,
and chlorate detected.</p>

<p>To find, in this way, nitrate of potassium, a coarse test is preferable to the finer
tests dependent upon conversion of the nitrate into nitrites or into ammonia, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
these tests are so delicate, that nitrates may be detected in traces; whereas, in this
examination, to find traces is of no value. Hence, the old-fashioned test of treating
the concentrated liquid in a test-tube with copper filings and then with sulphuric
acid, and looking for the red fumes, is best, and will act very well, even should, as
is commonly the case, some organic matters have passed through the dialyser.</p>

<p>Chlorates are indicated if the liquid is divided into two parts and tested in the
manner recommended at <a href="#Page_127">p. 127</a>. If present in any quantity, chlorates or nitrates
may be indicated by the brilliant combustion of the organic matter when heated to
redness, as also by the action of strong sulphuric acid on the solid substances&mdash;in
the one case, yellow vapours of peroxide of chlorine being evolved&mdash;in the other, the
red fumes already mentioned of nitric peroxide.</p>

<p>With regard to a substance such as the hydro-potassic tartrate, its insolubility in
water renders it not easy of detection by dialysis; but its very insolubility will aid
the analyst, for the contents of the stomach may be treated with water, and thus all
soluble salts of the alkalies extracted. On now microscopically examining the
insoluble residue, crystals of bitartrate, if present, will be readily seen. They may
be picked up on a clean platinum wire and heated to redness in a Bunsen flame, and
spectroscopically examined. After heating, the melted mass will have an alkaline
reaction, and give a precipitate with platinic chloride. All other organic salts of
potassium are soluble, and a white crystal giving such reaction must be hydro-potassic
tartrate.</p>

<p><b>Ammonium Salts.</b>&mdash;If the body is fresh, and yet the salts of ammonium present
in large amount, it is safe to conclude that they have an external origin; but there
might be some considerable difficulty in criminal poisoning by a neutral salt of
ammonium, and search for it in a highly putrid corpse. Probably, in such an exceptional
case, there would be other evidence. With regard to the quantitative separation
and estimation of the fixed alkalies in the ash of organic substances, the reader
is referred to the processes given in &#8220;Foods,&#8221; p. 99, <i>et seq.</i>, and in the present work,

into England, the original substance having previously undergone more or
less rectification. The lighter and more volatile portions are known under the name
of cymogene, rhigolene, gasolene, and naphtha.</p>

specific gravity varies from &middot;69 to &middot;74. It is very inflammable, and is used in sponge
lamps, and also as a solvent for gutta-percha, naphthalene, paraffin, wax, and many
other bodies. By the practical chemist it is much employed.</p>

<p>The similarity of the terms <i>benzoline</i> and <i>benzene</i> has caused benzoline to be often

and was extremely poisonous, the vapour killing a rabbit in a short time, with
previous insensibility and convulsions. The autopsy showed a thin extravasation of
blood on the surface of each of the bulbi, much coagulated blood in the heart, congested
lungs, and a bloody mucus covering the tracheal mucous membrane. An
experiment made on a cat with the lighter petroleum (which had no excess of
sulphur) in the state of vapour, showed that it was an an&aelig;sthetic, the an&aelig;sthesia

may pass on to insensibility, convulsions, and death. It often occasions a condition
of the voluntary muscles similar to that induced by drunkenness, and on recovery
the patient is troubled by singing in the ears and noises in the head. The smell

of petroleum, There followed a slight pain in the stomach, and a little febrile disturbance,
and a powerful smell of petroleum remained about the body for six days;
but she completely recovered. In August 1870 a sea-captain drank a quantity of
paraffin, that is, lighting petroleum, and died in a few hours in an unconscious state.
A child, 2 years old, was brought to King&#8217;s College Hospital within ten minutes
after taking a teaspoonful of paraffin. It was semi-comatose and pale, with contracted
pupils; there was no vomiting or purging. Emetics of sulphate of zinc were
administered, and the child recovered in twenty-four hours. In another case treated
at the same hospital, a child had swallowed an unknown quantity of paraffin. It
fell into a comatose state, which simulated tubercular meningitis, and lasted for
nearly three weeks.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize110">[137]</span></a> In a case recorded by Mr Robert Smith,<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> a child, 4 years of
age, had swallowed an unknown quantity of paraffin. A few minutes afterwards,
the symptoms commenced; they were those of suffocation, with a constant cough;
there was no expectoration; the tongue, gums, and cheeks were blanched and
swollen where the fluid touched them; recovery followed. A woman, aged 32,
who had taken a quarter of a pint of paraffin, was found unconscious and very cold;
the stomach-pump was used, and she recovered.<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize110">[139]</span></a> Hence it is tolerably certain, from
the above instances, that should a case of petroleum poisoning occur, the expert will
not have to deal with infinitesimal quantities; but while the odour of the oil will
probably be distinctly perceptible, there will be also a sufficient amount obtained
either from matters vomited, or the contents of the stomach, &amp;c., so that no difficulty
will be experienced in identifying it.</p>

<h5>DETECTION AND SEPARATION OF BENZENE.</h5>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><a name="Sect_149" id="Sect_149"></a>&sect; 149. Benzene is separated from liquids by distillation, and may be recognised
by its odour, and by the properties described at <a href="#Page_130">p. 130</a>. The best process of identification,
perhaps, is to purify and convert it into nitro-benzene, and then into aniline,
in the following manner:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1.  <b>Purification.</b>&mdash;The liquid is agitated with a solution of caustic soda; this dissolves
out of the benzene any bodies of an acid character, such as phenol, &amp;c. The
purified liquid should again be distilled, collecting that portion of the distillate
which passes over between 65&deg; and 100&deg;; directly the thermometer attains nearly the
100&deg;, the distillation should be stopped. The distillate, which contains all the benzene
present, is next shaken with concentrated sulphuric acid in the cold; this will
dissolve out all the hydrocarbons of the ethylene and acetylene series. On removing
the layer of benzene from the acid, it must be again shaken up with dilute soda,
so as to remove any trace of acid. The benzene is, by this rather complicated series
of operations, obtained in a very fair state of purity, and may be converted into
nitro-benzene, as follows:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>2.  <b>Conversion into Nitro-Benzene.</b>&mdash;The oily liquid is placed in a flask, and
treated with four times its volume of fuming nitric acid. The flask must be
furnished with an upright condenser; a vigorous action mostly takes place without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"><span class="fsize110">[133]</span></a></span>
the application of heat, but if this does not occur, the flask may be warmed for a few
minutes.</p>

<p>After the conversion is over, the liquid, while still warm, must be transferred into
a burette furnished with a glass tap, or to a separating funnel, and all, except
the top layer, run into cold water; if benzene was originally present, either oily
drops of nitro-benzene will fall, or if the benzene was only in small quantity, a fine
precipitate will gradually settle down to the bottom of the vessel, and a distinct
bitter-almond smell be observed; but, if there be no benzene in the original liquid,
and, consequently, no nitro-benzene formed, no such appearance will be observed.</p>

<p>3. <b>Conversion into Aniline.</b>&mdash;The nitro-benzene may itself be identified by collecting
it on a wet filter, dissolving it off the filter by alcohol, acidifying the alcoholic
solution by hydrochloric acid, and then boiling it for some time with metallic zinc.
In this way aniline is formed by reduction. On neutralising and diluting the liquid,
and cautiously adding a little clear solution of bleaching-powder, a blue or purple
colour passing to brown is in a little time produced.</p>

<h4>3. TERPENES&mdash;ESSENTIAL OILS&mdash;OIL OF TURPENTINE.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><a name="Sect_150" id="Sect_150"></a>&sect; 150. The terpenes are hydrocarbons of the general formula <span class="chemform">C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n-4</sub></span>. The
natural terpenes are divided into three classes:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. <b>The true terpenes</b>, <i>formula</i> (<span class="chemform">C<sub>10</sub>;H<sub>16</sub></span>)&mdash;a large number of essential oils, such as
those of turpentine, orange peel, nutmeg, caraway, anise, thyme, &amp;c., are mainly
composed of terpenes.</p>

<p>2. <b>The cedrenes</b>, <i>formula</i> (<span class="chemform">C<sub>15</sub>H<sub>24</sub></span>)&mdash;the essential oil of cloves, rosewood, cubebs,
calamus, cascarilla, and patchouli belong to this class.</p>

<p>3. <b>The colophene hydrocarbons</b>, <i>formula</i> (<span class="chemform">C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>32</sub></span>), represented by colophony.</p>

<p>Of all these, oil of turpentine alone has any toxicological significance; it is, however,
true that all the essential oils, if taken in considerable doses, are poisonous,
and cause, for the most part, vascular excitement and complex nervous phenomena,
but their action has not been very completely studied. They may all be separated
by distillation, but a more convenient process for recovering an essential oil from a
liquid is to shake it up with petroleum ether, separating the petroleum and evaporating
spontaneously; by this means the oil is left in a fair state of purity.</p>

</div><!--blockquote-->

<h4>4. OIL OF TURPENTINE&mdash;SPIRIT OF TURPENTINE&mdash;&#8220;TURPS.&#8221;</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><a name="Sect_151" id="Sect_151"></a>&sect; 151. Various species of pine yield a crude turpentine, holding in solution more
or less resin. The turpentine may be obtained from this exudation by distillation,
and when the first portion of the distillate is treated with alkali, and then redistilled,
the final product is known under the name of &#8220;rectified oil of turpentine,&#8221; and is
sometimes called &#8220;camphene.&#8221; It mainly consists of terebenthene.  Terebenthene
obtained from French turpentine differs in some respects from that obtained from
English or American turpentine. They are both mobile, colourless liquids, having
the well-known odour of turpentine and highly refractive; but the French terebenthene
turns a ray of polarised light to the left -40&middot;3&deg; for the sodium ray, and
the English to the right +21&middot;5&deg;; the latter terebenthene is known scientifically as
austra-terebenthene.  This action on polarised light is retained in the various
compounds and polymers of the two turpentine oils.</p>

<p>The specific gravity of turpentine oil is &middot;864; its boiling point, when consisting of
pure terebenthene, 156&deg;, but impurities may raise it up to 160&deg;; it is combustible
and burns with a smoky flame. Oil of turpentine is very soluble in ether, petroleum
ether, carbon disulphide, chloroform, benzene, fixed and essential oils, and by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"><span class="fsize110">[134]</span></a></span>
use of these solvents it is conveniently separated from the contents of the stomach.
It is insoluble in water, glycerin, and dilute alkaline and acid solutions; and very
soluble in absolute alcohol, from which it may be precipitated by the addition of
water.</p>

<p>It is polymerised by the action of strong sulphuric acid, the polymer, of course,
boiling at a higher temperature than the original oil. With water it forms a crystalline
hydrate (<span class="chemform">C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>20</sub>O<sub>2</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O</span>). On passing nitrosyl chloride gas into the oil,
either pure or diluted with chloroform or alcohol, the mixture being cooled by ice,
a white crystalline body is deposited, of the formula <span class="chemform">C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub>(NOCl)</span>. By treating
this compound with alcoholic potash, the substitution product (<span class="chemform">C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub>NO</span>) is
obtained.  By treating turpentine with an equal bulk of warm water, and shaking
it in a large bottle with air, camphoric acid and peroxide of hydrogen are formed.
When turpentine oil is left in contact with concentrated hydrochloric acid, there is
formed terebenthene dihydrochloride (<span class="chemform">C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub>2HCl</span>), which forms rhombic plates,
insoluble in water, and decomposable by boiling alcoholic potash, with formation of
terpinol, <span class="chemform">(C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>17</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O</span>.  The dihydrochloride gives a colour-reaction with ferric chloride.
This is an excellent test&mdash;not, it is true, confined to oil of turpentine&mdash;but common
to the dihydrochlorides of all the terpenes. A few drops of the oil are stirred in a
porcelain capsule with a drop of hydrochloric acid, and one of ferric chloride solution;
on gently heating, there is produced first a rose colour, then a violet-red, and
lastly a blue.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_152" id="Sect_152"></a>&sect; 152. <b>Effects of the Administration of Turpentine.</b>&mdash;L. W. Liersch<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize110">[143]</span></a> exposed
animals to the vapour of turpentine, and found that a cat and a rabbit died within
half an hour.  There was observed uneasiness, reeling, want of power in the limbs
(more especially in the hinder extremities), convulsions partial, or general, difficulty
of respiration; and the heart&#8217;s action was quickened. Death took place, in part,
from asphyxia, and in part was attributable to a direct action on the nervous centres.
The autopsy showed congestion of the lungs, ecchymoses of the kidney, and much
blood in the liver and spleen. Small doses of turpentine-vapour cause (according to
Sir B. W. Richardson)<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize110">[144]</span></a> giddiness, deficient appetite, and an&aelig;mia. From half an
ounce to an ounce is frequently prescribed in the country as a remedy for tape-worm;
in smaller quantities it is found to be a useful medicine in a great variety of ailments.
The larger doses produce a kind of intoxication with giddiness, followed often by
purging and strangury, not unfrequently blood and albumen (or both) is found in the
urine.  When in medical practice I have given the oil, and seen it given by others, in
large doses for tape-worm to adults, in perhaps 40 cases, but in no one instance
were the symptoms severe; the slight intoxication subsided quickly, and in a few
hours the patients recovered completely. Nevertheless it has been known to destroy
the lives of children, and cause most serious symptoms in adults. Two fatal cases
are mentioned by Taylor; one was that of a child who died fifteen hours after taking
half an ounce of the oil; in another an infant, five months old, died rapidly from a
teaspoonful.  The symptoms in these fatal cases were profound coma and slight
convulsions; the pupils were contracted, and there was slow and irregular breathing.
Turpentine is eliminated in a changed form by the kidneys, and imparts an odour of
violet to the urine; but the nature of the odoriferous principle has not yet been
investigated.</p>

<h3>II.&mdash;Camphor.</h3>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><a name="Sect_153" id="Sect_153"></a>&sect; 153. A great many essential oils deposit, after exposure to air, camphors produced
by oxidation of their terpenes. Ordinary camphor is imported in the rough
state from China and Japan, and is prepared by distilling with water the wood of
<i>Camphora officinarum</i>; it is resublimed in England. The formula of camphor is
<span class="chemform">C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O</span>; it has a density of &middot;986 to &middot;996; melts at 175&deg;, and boils at 205&deg;. It is
readily sublimed, especially in a vacuum, and is indeed so volatile at all temperatures,
that a lump of camphor exposed to the air wastes away. It is somewhat
insoluble in water (about 1 part in 1000), but this is enough to impart a distinct
taste to the water; it is insoluble in chloroform, ether, acetone, acetic acid, carbon
disulphide, and oils. It has a fragrant odour and a burning taste. A 10 per cent.
solution in alcohol turns a ray of polarised light to the right +42&middot;8&deg;.  By distillation
with zinc chloride, cymene and other products are produced. By prolonged treatment
with nitric acid, camphor is oxidised to camphoric acid (<span class="chemform">C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub>O<sub>4</sub></span>). Camphor
unites with bromine to form a crystalline, unstable dibromide, which splits up on
distillation into hydrobromic acid and monobrom-camphor (<span class="chemform">C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>15</sub>BrO</span>).  The latter
is used in medicine; it crystallises in prisms fusible at 76&deg;, and is readily soluble in
alcohol.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_154" id="Sect_154"></a>&sect; 154. <b>Pharmaceutical Preparations.</b>&mdash;The preparations officinal in the British
Pharmacop&#339;ia are <i>camphor water</i>&mdash;water saturated with camphor, containing about
one part per thousand.</p>

<p><b>Camphor Liniment.</b>&mdash;A solution of camphor in olive oil, strength 25 per cent.</p>

<p><b>Compound Camphor Liniment.</b>&mdash;Composed of camphor, oil of lavender, strong
solution of ammonia and alcohol; strength in camphor about 11 per cent.</p>

<p><b>Spirit of Camphor.</b>&mdash;A solution of camphor in spirit; strength, 10 per cent.</p>

<p>Camphor is also a constituent of the <i>compound tincture of camphor</i>; but in this
case it may be considered only a flavouring agent. There is a hom&#339;opathic solution
of camphor in spirit (Rubini&#8217;s Essence of Camphor). The solution is made by saturating
alcohol with camphor; it is, therefore, very strong&mdash;about half the bulk
consisting of camphor. Camphor is used in veterinary medicine, both externally and
internally.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_155" id="Sect_155"></a>&sect; 155. <b>Symptoms.</b>&mdash;Camphor acts energetically on the brain and nervous system,
especially if it is given in strong alcoholic solution, and thus placed under conditions
favouring absorption.  Some years ago, Dr. G. Johnson<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize110">[145]</span></a> published a series of cases

to 40 drops of Rubini&#8217;s hom&#339;opathic camphor taken for colds, sore throat, &amp;c.,
having produced coma, foaming at the mouth, convulsions, and partial paralysis.
All the patients recovered, but their condition was for a little time alarming.</p>

with the appropriate tests, in &#8220;Foods,&#8221; pp. 369-384, and the reader is
also referred to the same volume for the composition and strength of
the various alcoholic drinks.</p>

<p><b>Statistics.</b>&mdash;If we were to include in one list the deaths indirectly
due to chronic, as well as acute poisoning by alcohol, it would stand first
of all poisons in order of frequency, but the taking of doses so large as to
cause death in a few hours is rare. The deaths from alcohol are included
by the English registrar-general under two heads, viz., those returned as
dying from <i>delirium tremens</i>, and those certified as due directly to intemperance.</p>

<p>During the twenty-five years, from 1868 to 1892, 30,219 deaths have
been registered as due to intemperance, which gives an average of 1209
per year. The rate per million has varied during the period from 29 to
71; and the figures taken as a whole show that deaths from intemperance
appear to be increasing; the increase may be only apparent, not real, for
it is a significant circumstance that deaths registered under liver diseases
show a corresponding decrease; it is, therefore, not unlikely that deaths
which formerly would be ascribed to liver disease, are more often now
stated to be the effects of intemperance.</p>

<p>Deaths directly due to large doses of alcohol are not uncommon;
during the ten years ending 1892, 105 deaths (81 males and 24 females)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
were ascribed under the head of &#8220;accident or negligence&#8221; directly to
alcohol.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_159" id="Sect_159"></a>&sect; 159. <b>Criminal or Accidental Alcoholic Poisoning.</b>&mdash;Suicide by
alcohol, in the common acceptation of the term, is rare, and murder
still rarer, though not unknown. In the ten years ending 1892, only
three deaths from alcohol (1 male and 2 females) are recorded as suicidal.
Perhaps the most common cause of fatal acute poisoning by alcohol is
either a foolish wager, by which a man bets that he can drink so many
glasses of spirits without bad effect; or else the drugging of a person
already drunk by his companions in a sportive spirit.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_160" id="Sect_160"></a>&sect; 160. <b>Fatal Dose.</b>&mdash;It is difficult to say what would be likely to
prove a lethal dose of alcohol, for a great deal depends, without doubt,
on the dilution of the spirit, since the mere local action of strong alcohol
on the mucous membranes of the stomach, &amp;c., is severe (one may almost
say corrosive), and would aid the more remote effects. In Maschka&#8217;s
case,<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> a boy of nine years and a girl of five, died from about two and a
half ounces of spirit of 67 per cent. strength, or 48&middot;2 c.c. (1&middot;7 oz.) of
absolute alcohol.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_149" id="Footnote_149"></a><a href="#FNanchor_149"><span class="label">[149]</span></a> Recorded by Maschka (<i>Gutachten der Prager Facult&auml;t</i>, iv. 239; see
also Maschka&#8217;s <i>Handbuch der gericht. Medicin</i>, Band. ii. p. 384). The
following is a brief summary:&mdash;Franz. Z., nine years old, and Caroline
Z., eight years old, were poisoned by their stepfather with spirit of 67
per cent. strength taken in small quantities by each&mdash;at first by
persuasion, and the remainder administered by force. About one-eighth of
a pint is said to have been given to each child. Both vomited somewhat,
then lying down, stertorous breathing at once came on, and they quickly
died. The autopsy, three days after death, showed dilatation of the
pupils; <i>rigor mortis</i> present in the boy, not in the girl; and the
membranes of the brain filled with dark fluid blood. The smell of
alcohol was perceptible on opening the chest; the mucous membrane of the
bronchial tubes and gullet was normal, both lungs &#339;dematous, the fine
tubes gorged with a bloody frothy fluid, and the mucous membrane of the
whole intestinal canal was reddened. The stomach was not, unfortunately,
examined, being reserved for chemical analysis. The heart was healthy;
the pericardium contained some straw-coloured fluid. Chemical analysis
gave an entirely negative result, which must have been from insufficient
material having been submitted to the analyst, for I cannot see how the
vapours of alcohol could have been detected by the smell, and yet have
evaded chemical processes.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>In a case related by Taylor, a child, seven years old, died from some
quantity of brandy, probably about 113&middot;4 c.c. (4 ozs.), which would be
equal to at least 56&middot;7 c.c. (2 ozs.) of absolute alcohol. From other cases
in which the quantity of absolute alcohol can be, with some approximation
to the truth, valued, it is evident that, for any child below ten or
twelve, quantities of from 28&middot;3 to 56&middot;6 c.c. (1-2 ozs.) of absolute alcohol
contained in brandy, gin, &amp;c., would be a highly dangerous and probably
fatal dose; while the toxic dose for adults is somewhere between 71&middot;8-141&middot;7
c.c. (2&middot;5-5 ozs.).</p>

<p><a name="Sect_161" id="Sect_161"></a>&sect; 161. <b>Symptoms.</b>&mdash;In the cases of rapid poisoning by a large dose of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
alcohol, which alone concern us, the preliminary, and too familiar
excitement of the drunkard, may be hardly observable; but the second
stage, that of depression, rapidly sets in; the unhappy victim sinks
down to the ground helpless, the face pale, the eyes injected and staring,
the pupils dilated, acting sluggishly to light, and the skin remarkably
cold. Fr&auml;ntzel<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> found, in a case in which the patient survived, a
temperature of only 24&middot;6&deg; in the rectum, and in that of another person
who died, a temperature of 23&middot;8&deg;. The mucous membranes are of a
peculiar dusky blue; the pulse, which at first is quick, soon becomes
slow and small; the respiration is also slowed, intermittent, and
stertorous; there is complete loss of consciousness and motion; the
breath smells strongly of the alcoholic drink, and if the coma continues
there may be vomiting and involuntary passing of excreta. Death
ultimately occurs through paralysis of the respiratory centres. Convulsions
in adults are rare, in children frequent. Death has more than
once been immediately caused, not by the poison, but by accidents
dependent upon loss of consciousness. Thus food has been sucked into
the air-tubes, or the person has fallen, so that the face was buried in
water, ordure, or mud; here suffocation has been induced by mechanical
causes.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>A remarkable course not known with any other narcotic is that in
which the symptoms remit, the person wakes up, as it were, moves about
and does one or more rational acts, and then suddenly dies. In this case
also, the death is not directly due to alcohol, but indirectly&mdash;the alcohol
having developed &#339;dema, pneumonia, or other affection of the lungs,
which causes the sudden termination when the first effect of the poison
has gone off. The time that may elapse from the commencement of
coma till death varies from a few minutes to days; death has occurred
after a quarter of an hour, half an hour, and an hour. It has also been
prolonged to three, four, and six days, during the whole of which the
coma has continued. The average period may, however, be put at from
six to ten hours.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_162" id="Sect_162"></a>&sect; 162. <b>Post-mortem Appearances.</b>&mdash;Cadaveric rigidity lasts tolerably
long. Casper has seen it still existing nine days after death, and Seidel<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
seven days (in February). Putrefaction is retarded in those cases in
which a very large dose has been taken, but this is not a very noticeable
or constant characteristic. The pupils are mostly dilated. The smell of
alcohol should be watched for; sometimes it is only present in cases where
but a short time has elapsed between the taking of the poison and
death; putrefaction may also conceal it, but under favourable circumstances,
especially if the weather is cold, the alcoholic smell may remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
a long time. Alcohol may cause the most intense redness and congestion
of the stomach. The most inflamed stomach I ever saw, short of inflammation
by the corrosive poisons, was that of a sailor, who died suddenly
after a twenty-four hours&#8217; drinking bout: all the organs of the body were
fairly healthy, the man had suffered from no disease; analysis could
detect no poison but alcohol; and the history of the case, moreover,
proved clearly that it was a pure case of alcoholic poisoning.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>In a case related by Taylor, in which a child drank 4 ozs. of
brandy and died, the mucous membrane of the stomach presented patches
of intense redness, and in several places was thickened and softened,
some portions being actually detached and hanging loose, and there were
evident signs of extravasations of blood. The effect may not be confined
to the stomach, but extend to the duodenum and even to the whole
intestinal canal. The blood is generally dark and fluid, and usually the
contents of the skull are markedly hyper&aelig;mic, the pia very full of blood,
the sinuses and plexus gorged; occasionally, the brain-substance shows
signs of unusual congestion; serum is often found in the ventricles.
The great veins of the neck, the lungs, and the right side of the heart,
are very often found full of blood, and the left side empty. &#338;dema of
the lungs also occurs with tolerable frequency. The great veins of the
abdomen are also filled with blood, and if the coma has been prolonged,
the bladder will be distended with urine. A rare phenomenon has also
been noticed&mdash;namely, the occurrence of blebs on the extremities, &amp;c.,
just as if the part affected had been burnt or scalded. Lastly, with the
changes directly due to the fatal dose may be included all those degenerations
met with in the chronic drinker, provided the case had a history
of previous intemperance.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_163" id="Sect_163"></a>&sect; 163. <b>Excretion of Alcohol.</b>&mdash;Alcohol, in the diluted form, is quickly
absorbed by the blood-vessels of the stomach, &amp;c., and circulates in the
blood; but what becomes of it afterwards is by no means settled. I
think there can be little doubt that the lungs are the main channels
through which it is eliminated; with persons given up to habits of
intemperance, the breath has constantly a very peculiar ethereal odour,
probably dependent upon some highly volatile oxidised product of
alcohol.</p>

<p>Alcohol is eliminated in small proportion only by the kidneys.
Thudichum, in an experiment<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> by which 4000 grms. of absolute alcohol
were consumed by thirty-three men, could only find in the collected
urine 10 grms. of alcohol. The numerous experiments by Dupr&eacute; also
establish the same truth, that but a fraction of the total alcohol absorbed
is excreted by the kidneys. According to Lallemand, Perrin, and Duroy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the content of the brain in alcohol is more than that of the other organs.
I have found also that the brain after death has a wonderful attraction
for alcohol, and yields it up at a water-heat very slowly and with
difficulty. In one experiment, in which a finely-divided portion of brain,
which had been soaking in alcohol for many weeks, was submitted to a
steam heat of 100&deg;, twenty-four hours&#8217; consecutive heating failed to expel
every trace of spirit.</p>

both his own and Dr. Dupr&eacute;&#8217;s experiments are summarised.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>It is probable that true alcoholates of the chemical constituents of the
brain are formed. In the case of vegetable colloidal bodies, such, for
example, as the pulp of cherries, a similar attraction has been observed,
the fruit condensing, as it were, the alcohol in its own tissues, and the
outer liquid being of less alcoholic strength than that which can be
expressed from the steeped cherries. Alcohol is also excreted by the
sweat, and minute fractions have been found in the f&aelig;ces.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_164" id="Sect_164"></a>&sect; 164. <b>Toxicological Detection of Alcohol</b> (see &#8220;Foods,&#8221; pp. 406-419).&mdash;The
living cells of the body produce minute quantities of alcohol, as also
some of the bacteria normally inhabiting the small intestine produce
small quantities of alcohol, and it is often found in traces in putrefying
fluids. Hence, mere qualitative proofs of the presence of alcohol are
insufficient on which to base an opinion as to whether alcohol had been
taken during life or not, and it will be necessary to estimate the quantity
accurately by some of the processes detailed in &#8220;Foods,&#8221; p. 409, <i>et seq.</i> In
those cases in which alcohol is found in quantity in the stomach, there
can, of course, be no difficulty; in others, the whole of the alcohol may
have been absorbed, and chemical evidence, unless extremely definite,
must be supplemented by other facts.</p>

<p>Richardson, as the result of his investigations, considers that amyl alcohol
when breathed sets up quite a peculiar class of symptoms which last for many hours,
and are of such a character, that it might be thought impossible for the animal to
recover, although they have not been known to prove fatal. There is muscular
paralysis with paroxysms of tremulous convulsions; the spasms are excited by touching
the animal, breathing upon it, or otherwise subjecting it to trifling excitation.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_167" id="Sect_167"></a>&sect; 167. Hitherto, neither the impure fusel oil, nor the purer chemical preparation,
has had any toxicological importance. Should it be necessary at any time to recover
small quantities from organic liquids, the easiest way is to shake the liquid up with
chloroform, which readily dissolves amylic alcohol, and on evaporation leaves it in a
state pure enough to be identified. Amyl alcohol is identified by the following
tests:&mdash;(1) Its physical properties; (2) if warmed with twice its volume of strong
sulphuric acid, a rose or red colour is produced; (3) heated with an acetate and
strong sulphuric acid, <i>amyl acetate</i>, which has the odour of the jargonelle pear, is
formed; (4) heated with sulphuric acid and potassic dichromate, valeric aldehyde is
first produced, and then valeric acid is formed; the latter has a most peculiar and
strong odour.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_168" id="Sect_168"></a>&sect; 168. <b>Amyl Nitrite, Iso-amyl Ester Nitrite</b> (<span class="chemform">C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>11</sub>NO<sub>2</sub></span>).&mdash;Boiling point 97&deg; to
99&deg;, specific gravity &middot;877. Amyl nitrite is a limpid, and, generally, slightly yellow
liquid; it has a peculiar and characteristic odour. On heating with alcoholic potash,
the products are nitrite of potash and amylic alcohol; the amylic alcohol may be
distilled off and identified. The presence of a nitrite in the alkaline solution is readily
shown by the colour produced, by adding a few drops of a solution of meta-phenylenediamine.</p>

<p>Sir B. W. Richardson and others have investigated the action of amyl nitrite, as
well as that of the acetate and iodide; they all act in a similar manner, the nitrite
being most potent. After absorption, the effects of amyl nitrite are especially seen
on the heart and circulation: the heart acts violently, there is first dilatation of the
capillaries, then this is followed by diminished action of the heart and contraction
of the capillaries.</p>

<p>According to Richardson, it suspends the animation of frogs. No other substance
known will thus suspend a frog&#8217;s animation for so long a time without killing
it. Under favourable circumstances, the animal will remain apparently dead for
many days, and yet recover. Warm-blooded animals may be thrown by amyl
nitrite into a cataleptic condition. It is not an an&aelig;sthetic, and by its use consciousness
is not destroyed, unless a condition approaching death be first produced. When
this occurs there is rarely recovery, the animal passes into actual death.</p>

<p><b>Post-Mortem Appearances.</b>&mdash;If administered quickly, the lungs and all the other
organs are found blanched and free from blood, the right side of the heart gorged
with blood, the left empty, the brain being free from congestion. If administered
slowly, the brain is found congested, and there is blood both on the left and right
sides of the heart.</p>

<h3>IV.&mdash;Ether.</h3>

<p><a name="Sect_169" id="Sect_169"></a>&sect; 169. <b>Ether, Ethylic Ether, Ethyl Oxide,</b> <span class="chemform">(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O</span>.&mdash;Ethylic ether
is a highly mobile liquid of peculiar penetrating odour and sweetish
pungent taste. It is perfectly colourless, and evaporates so rapidly, that
when applied in the form of spray to the skin, the latter becomes frozen,
and is thus deprived of sensibility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Pure ether has a density of &middot;713, its boiling-point is 35&deg;, but commercial
samples, which often contain water (1 part of water is soluble in
35 of ether), may have a higher gravity, and also a higher boiling-point.
The readiest way to know whether an ether is anhydrous or not,
is to shake it up with a little carbon disulphide. If it is hydrous, the
mixture is milky. Methylated ether is largely used in commerce; its
disagreeable odour is due to contamination by methylated compounds;
otherwise the ether made from methylated spirit is ethylic ether, for
methylic ether is a gas which escapes during the process. Hence the
term &#8220;methylated&#8221; ether is misleading, for it contains no methylic
ether, but is essentially a somewhat impure ethylic ether.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_170" id="Sect_170"></a>&sect; 170. <b>Ether as a Poison.</b>&mdash;Ether has but little toxicological
importance. There are a few cases of death from its use as an
an&aelig;sthetic, and a few cases of suicide. Ether is used by some people as
a stimulant, but ether drinkers are uncommon. It causes an intoxication
very similar to that of alcohol, but of brief duration. In a case of
chronic ether-taking recorded by Martin,<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> in which a woman took daily
doses of ether for the purpose of allaying a gastric trouble, the patient
suffered from shivering or trembling of the hands and feet, muscular
weakness, cramp in the calves of the legs, pain in the breast and back,
intermittent headaches, palpitation, singing in the ears, vomitings, and
wakefulness; the ether being discontinued, the patient recovered. In
one of Orfila&#8217;s experiments, half an ounce of ether was administered to a
dog. The animal died insensible in three hours. The mucous membrane
of the stomach was found highly inflamed, the inflammation
extending somewhat into the duodenum; the rest of the canal was
healthy. The lungs were gorged with fluid blood.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p><a name="Sect_171" id="Sect_171"></a>&sect; 171. <b>Fatal Dose.</b>&mdash;The fatal dose of ether, when taken as a liquid,
is not known. 4 grms. (1&middot;28 drms.) cause toxic symptoms, but the effect
soon passes. Buchanan has seen a brandy-drinker consume 25 grms.
(7 drms.) and yet survive. It is probable that most adults would be
killed by a fluid ounce (28&middot;4 c.c.).</p>

<p><a name="Sect_172" id="Sect_172"></a>&sect; 172. <b>Ether as an An&aelig;sthetic.</b>&mdash;Ether is now much used as an
an&aelig;sthetic, and generally in conjunction with chloroform. An&aelig;sthesia
by ether is said to compare favourably with that produced by chloroform.
In 92,000 cases of operations performed under ether, the proportion
dying from the effects of the an&aelig;sthetic was only &middot;3 per 10,000 (Morgan),
while chloroform gives a higher number (see <a href="#Page_149">p. 149</a>). The mortality in
America, again, from a mixture of chloroform and ether in 11,000 cases
is reckoned at 1&middot;7 per 10,000; but this proportion is rather above some
of the calculations relative to the mortality from pure chloroform, so that
the question can hardly be considered settled. The symptoms of ether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
narcosis are very similar to those produced by chloroform. The chief
point of difference appears to be its action on the heart. Ether, when
first breathed, stimulates the heart&#8217;s action, and the after-depression that
follows never reaches so high a grade as with chloroform. Ether is said
to kill by paralysing the respiration, and in cases which end fatally the
breathing is seen to stop suddenly: convulsions have not been noticed.
The <i>post-mortem</i> appearances, as in the case of chloroform, are not
characteristic.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_173" id="Sect_173"></a>&sect; 173. <b>Separation of Ether from Organic Fluids, &amp;c.</b>&mdash;Despite the
low boiling-point of ether, it is by no means easy to separate it from
organic substances <i>so as to recover the whole of the ether present</i>. The
best way is to place the matters in a flask connected with an ordinary
Liebig&#8217;s condenser, the tube of the latter at its farther end fitting closely
into the doubly perforated cork of a flask. Into the second perforation
is adapted an upright tube about 2 feet long, which may be of small
diameter, and must be surrounded by a freezing mixture of ice and salt.
The upper end of this tube is closed by a thistle-head funnel with
syphon, and in the bend of the syphon a little mercury serves as a valve.
Heat is now applied to the flask by means of a water-bath, and continued
for several hours; the liquid which has distilled over is then treated with
dry calcic chloride and redistilled exactly in the same way. To this
distillate again a similar process may be used, substituting dry potassic
carbonate for the calcic chloride. It is only by operating on these principles
that the expert can recover in an approximate state of anhydrous
purity such a volatile liquid. Having thus obtained it pure, it may be
identified (1) by its smell, (2) by its boiling-point, (3) by its inflammability,
and (4) by its reducing chromic acid. The latter test may be
applied to the vapour. An asbestos fibre is soaked in a mixture of strong
sulphuric acid and potassic dichromate, and then placed in the tube
connected with the flask&mdash;the ethereal (or alcoholic) vapour passing over
the fibre, immediately reduces the chromic acid to chromic oxide, with
the production of a green colour.</p>

<h3>V.&mdash;Chloroform.</h3>

<p class="center">CHLOROFORM, TRICHLOROMETHANE OR METHENYL CHLORIDE
(<span class="chemform">CHCl<sub>3</sub></span>).</p>

<p><a name="Sect_174" id="Sect_174"></a>&sect; 174. Chloroform appears to have been discovered independently by
Soubeiran and Liebig, about 1830. It was first employed in medicine
by Simpson, of Edinburgh, as an an&aelig;sthetic. Pure chloroform has a
density of 1&middot;491 at 17&deg;, and boils at 60&middot;8&deg;; but commercial samples have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
gravities of from 1&middot;47 to 1&middot;491. It is a colourless liquid, strongly
refracting light; it cannot be ignited by itself, but, when mixed with
alcohol, burns with a smoky flame edged with green. Its odour is
heavy, but rather pleasant; the taste is sweet and burning.</p>

<p>Chloroform sinks in water, and is only slightly soluble in that fluid
(&middot;44 in 100 c.c.), it is perfectly neutral in reaction, and very volatile.
When rubbed on the skin, it should completely evaporate, leaving no
odour. Pure absolute chloroform gives an opaline mixture if mixed
with from 1 to 5 volumes of alcohol, but with any quantity above
5 volumes the mixture is clear; it mixes in all proportions with ether.
Chloroform coagulates albumen, and is an excellent solvent for most
organic bases&mdash;camphor, caoutchouc, amber, opal, and all common resins.
It dissolves phosphorus and sulphur slightly&mdash;more freely iodine and
bromine. It floats on hydric sulphate, which only attacks it at a boiling
heat.</p>

<p>Chloroform is frequently impure from faulty manufacture or decomposition.
The impurities to be sought are alcohol, methylated chloroform,<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
dichloride of ethylene (<span class="chemform">C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub></span>), chloride of ethyl (<span class="chemform">C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>Cl</span>),
aldehyde, chlorine, hydrochloric, hypochlorous, and traces of sulphuric
acid: there have also been found chlorinated oils. One of the best tests
for contamination by alcohol, wood spirit, or ether, is that known as
Roussin&#8217;s; dinitrosulphide of iron<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> is added to chloroform. If it contain
any of these impurities, it acquires a dark colour, but if pure, remains
bright and colourless.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_158" id="Footnote_158"></a><a href="#FNanchor_158"><span class="label">[158]</span></a> Methylated chloroform is that which is prepared from methylated
spirit. It is liable to more impurities than that made from pure
alcohol, but, of course, its composition is the same, and it has
recently been manufactured from this source almost chemically pure.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_159" id="Footnote_159"></a><a href="#FNanchor_159"><span class="label">[159]</span></a> Made by slowly adding ferric sulphate to a boiling solution of
ammonic sulphide and potassic nitrite, as long as the precipitate
continues to redissolve, and then filtering the solution.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>The presence of alcohol or ether, or both, may also be discovered by
the bichromate test, which is best applied as follows:&mdash;A few milligrammes
of potassic bichromate are placed at the bottom of a test-tube
with four or five drops of sulphuric acid, which liberates the chromic
acid; next, a very little water is added to dissolve the chromic acid; and
lastly, the chloroform. The whole is now shaken, and allowed to separate.
If the chloroform is pure, the mass is hardly tinged a greenish-yellow,
and no layer separates. If, however, there is anything like 5 per
cent. of alcohol or ether present, the deep green of chromium chloride
appears, and there is a distinct layer at the bottom of the tube.</p>

<p>Another way to detect alcohol in chloroform, and also to make an
approximate estimation of its quantity, is to place 20 c.c. of chloroform
in a burette, and then add 80 c.c. of water. On shaking violently, pure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
chloroform will sink to the bottom in clear globules, and the measurement
will be as nearly as possible the original quantity; but if anything like a
percentage of alcohol be present, the chloroform is seen to be diminished
in quantity, and its surface is opalescent, the diminution being caused by
the water dissolving out the alcohol. The addition of a few drops of
potash solution destroys the meniscus, and allows of a close reading of
the volume. The supernatant water may be utilised for the detection of
other impurities, and tested for sulphuric acid by baric chloride, for free
chlorine and hypochlorous acid by starch and potassic iodide, and for
hydrochloric acid by silver nitrate.<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Fuchsine, proposed by St&#339;deler, is
also a delicate reagent for the presence of alcohol in chloroform, the
sample becoming red in the presence of alcohol, and the tint being
proportionate to the quantity present. The most delicate test for alcohol
is, however, the iodoform test fully described in &#8220;Foods,&#8221; p. 375.<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
Dichloride of ethylene is detected by shaking up the chloroform with dry
potassic carbonate, and then adding metallic potassium. This does not
act on pure chloroform, but only in presence of ethylene dichloride, when
the gaseous chlor-ethylene (<span class="chemform">C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>Cl</span>) is evolved. Ethyl-chloride is detected
by distilling the chloroform and collecting the first portions of the distillate;
it will have a distinct odour of ethyl-chloride should it be present.
Methyl compounds and empyreumatic oils are roughly detected by
allowing the chloroform to evaporate on a cloth. If present, the cloth,
when the chloroform has evaporated, will have a peculiar disagreeable
odour. Aldehyde is recognised by its reducing action on argentic
nitrate; the mineral acids by the reddening of litmus paper, and the
appropriate tests. Hypochlorous acid first reddens, and then bleaches,
litmus-paper.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_160" id="Footnote_160"></a><a href="#FNanchor_160"><span class="label">[160]</span></a> Neither an alcoholic nor an aqueous solution of silver nitrate
causes the slightest change in pure chloroform.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_161" id="Footnote_161"></a><a href="#FNanchor_161"><span class="label">[161]</span></a> An attempt has been made by Besnou to estimate the amount of
alcohol by the specific gravity. He found that a chloroform of 1&middot;4945
gravity, mixed with 5 per cent. of alcohol, gave a specific gravity of
1&middot;4772; 10 per cent., 1&middot;4602; 20 per cent., 1&middot;4262; and 25 per cent.,
1&middot;4090. It would, therefore, seem that every percentage of alcohol
lowers the gravity by &middot;0034.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>Dr. Dott, <i>Pharm. Journ.</i>, 1894, p. 629, gives the following tests:&mdash;Specific
gravity, 1&middot;490 to 1&middot;495. On allowing <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> fluid drm. to evaporate
from a clean surface, no foreign odour is perceptible at any stage of the
evaporation. When 1 fluid drm. is agitated with an equal volume of
solution of silver nitrate, no precipitate or turbidity is produced after
standing for five minutes. On shaking up the chloroform with half its
volume of distilled water, the water should not redden litmus-paper.
When shaken with an equal volume of sulphuric acid, little or no colour
should be imparted to the acid.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_175" id="Sect_175"></a>&sect; 175. The ordinary method of manufacturing chloroform is by distilling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
alcohol with chlorinated lime; but another mode is now much in use&mdash;viz.,
the decomposition of chloral hydrate. By distilling it with a weak
alkali, this process yields such a pure chloroform, that, for medicinal
purposes, it should supersede every other.</p>

<h4>Poisonous Effects of Chloroform.</h4>

<h5>1. AS A LIQUID.</h5>

<p><a name="Sect_176" id="Sect_176"></a>&sect; 176. <b>Statistics.</b>&mdash;Falck finds recorded in medical literature 27
cases of poisoning by chloroform having been swallowed&mdash;of these
15 were men, 9 were women, and 3 children. Eighteen of the cases
were suicidal, and 10 of the 18 died; the remainder took the liquid by
mistake.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_177" id="Sect_177"></a>&sect; 177. <b>Local Action of Chloroform.</b>&mdash;When applied to the skin or
mucous membranes in such a way that the fluid cannot evaporate&mdash;as,
for example, by means of a cloth steeped in chloroform laid on the bare
skin, and covered over with some impervious material&mdash;there is a burning
sensation, which soon ceases, and leaves the part an&aelig;sthetised, while the
skin, at the same time, is reddened and sometimes even blistered.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_178" id="Sect_178"></a>&sect; 178. Chloroform added to blood, or passed through it in the state of
vapour, causes it to assume a peculiar brownish colour owing to destruction
of the red corpuscles and solution of the h&aelig;moglobin in the plasma.
The change does not require the presence of atmospheric air, but takes
place equally in an atmosphere of hydrogen. It has been shown by
Schmiedeberg that the chloroform enters in some way into a state of
combination with the blood-corpuscles, for the entire quantity cannot be
recovered by distillation; whereas the plasma, similarly treated, yields
the entire quantity which has in the first place been added. Schmiedeberg
also asserts that the oxygen is in firmer combination with the
chloroformised blood than usual, as shown by its slow extraction by
stannous oxide. Muscle, exposed to chloroform liquid by arterial injection,
quickly loses excitability and becomes rigid. Nerves are first
stimulated, and then their function for the time is annihilated; but on
evaporation of the chloroform, the function is restored.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_179" id="Sect_179"></a>&sect; 179. <b>General Effects of the Liquid.</b>&mdash;However poisonous in a state
of vapour, chloroform cannot be considered an extremely active poison
when taken into the stomach as a liquid, for enormous quantities,
relatively, have been drunk without fatal effect. Thus, there is the case
recorded by Taylor, in which a man, who had swallowed 113&middot;4 grms.
(4 ozs.), walked a considerable distance after taking the dose. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
subsequently fell into a state of coma, with dilated pupils, stertorous
breathing, and imperceptible pulse. These symptoms were followed by
convulsions, but the patient recovered in five days.</p>

<p>In a case related by Burkart,<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> a woman desired to kill herself with
chloroform, and procured for that purpose 50 grms. (a little less than
one ounce and a half); she drank some of it, but the burning taste and
the sense of heat in the mouth, throat, and stomach, prevented her
from taking the whole at once. After a few moments, the pain passing
off, she essayed to drink the remainder, and did swallow the greater
portion of it, but was again prevented by the suffering it caused.
Finally, she poured what remained on a cloth, and placing it over her
face, soon sank into a deep narcosis. She was found lying on the bed
very pale, with blue lips, and foaming a little at the mouth; the head
was rigidly bent backwards, the extremities were lax, the eyes were
turned upwards and inwards, the pupils dilated and inactive, the face
and extremities were cold, the body somewhat warmer, there was no
pulse at the wrist, the carotids beat feebly, the breathing was deep and
rattling, and after five or six inspirations ceased. By the aid of artificial
respiration, &amp;c., she recovered in an hour.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>A still larger dose has been recovered from in the case of a young
man, aged 23,<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> who had swallowed no less than 75 grms. (2&middot;6 ozs.)
of chloroform, but yet, in a few hours, awoke from the stupor. He
complained of a burning pain in the stomach; on the following day he
suffered from vomiting, and on the third day symptoms of jaundice
appeared,&mdash;a feature which has been several times noticed as an effect of
chloroform.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>On the other hand, even small doses have been known to destroy life.
In a case related by Taylor, a boy, aged 4, swallowed 3&middot;8 grms.
(1 drm.) of chloroform and died in three hours, notwithstanding that
every effort was used for his recovery.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_180" id="Sect_180"></a>&sect; 180. The smallest dose that has proved fatal <i>to an adult</i> is 15 grms.
(a little over 4 drms.).</p>

<p>From twenty-two cases in which the quantity taken had been ascertained
with some degree of accuracy, Falck draws the following conclusions:&mdash;In
eight of the cases the dose was between 4 and 30 grms.,
and one death resulted from 15 grms. As for the other fourteen persons,
the doses varied from 35 to 380 grms., and eight of these patients died&mdash;two
after 40, two after 45, one after 60, 90, 120, and 180 grms. respectively.
Hence, under conditions favouring the action of the poison,
15 grms. (4&middot;3 drms.) may be fatal to an adult, while doses of 40 grms.
(11&middot;3 drms.) and upwards will almost certainly kill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Sect_181" id="Sect_181"></a>&sect; 181. <b>Symptoms.</b>&mdash;The symptoms can be well gathered from the
cases quoted. They commence shortly after the taking of the poison;
and, indeed, the local action of the liquid immediately causes first a
burning sensation, followed by numbness.</p>

<p>Often after a few minutes, precisely as when the vapour is administered,
a peculiar, excited condition supervenes, accompanied, it may be,
by delirium. The next stage is narcosis, and the patient lies with pale
face and livid lips, &amp;c., as described at <a href="#Page_147">p. 147</a>; the end of the scene
is often preceded by convulsions. Sometimes, however, consciousness
returns, and the irritation of the mucous membranes of the gastro-intestinal
canal is shown by bloody vomiting and bloody stools, with
considerable pain and general suffering. In this way, a person may
linger several days after the ingestion of the poison. In a case observed
by Pomeroy, the fatal malady was prolonged for eight days. Among
those who recover, a common <i>sequela</i>, as before mentioned, is jaundice.</p>

<p>A third form of symptoms has been occasionally observed, viz.:&mdash;The
person awakes from the coma, the breathing and pulse become again
natural, and all danger seems to have passed, when suddenly, after a
longer or shorter time, without warning, a state of general depression and
collapse supervenes, and death occurs.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_182" id="Sect_182"></a>&sect; 182. <b>Post-mortem Appearances.</b>&mdash;The <i>post-mortem</i> appearances from
a fatal dose of liquid chloroform mainly resolve themselves into redness
of the mucous membrane of the stomach, though occasionally, as in
Pomeroy&#8217;s case, there may be an ulceration. In a case recorded by
Hoffman,<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> a woman, aged 30, drank 35 to 40 grms. of chloroform
and died within the hour. Almost the whole of the chloroform taken
was found in the stomach, as a heavy fluid, coloured green, through the
bile. The epithelium of the pharynx, epiglottis, and gullet was of a
dirty colour, partly detached, whitened, softened, and easily stripped off.
The mucous membrane of the stomach was much altered in colour and
consistence, and, with the duodenum, was covered with a tenacious grey
slime. There was no ecchymosis.</p>

<h5>2. THE VAPOUR OF CHLOROFORM.</h5>

<p><a name="Sect_183" id="Sect_183"></a>&sect; 183. <b>Statistics.</b>&mdash;Accidents occur far more frequently in the use of
chloroform vapour for an&aelig;sthetic purposes than in the use of the liquid.</p>

<p>Most of the cases of death through chloroform vapour, are those caused
accidentally in surgical and medical practice. A smaller number are
suicidal, while for criminal purposes, its use is extremely infrequent.</p>

<p>The percentage of deaths caused by chloroform administered during
operations is unaccountably different in different years, times, and places.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
The diversity of opinion on the subject is partly (though not entirely)
explicable, by the degrees of purity in the an&aelig;sthetic administered, the
different modes of administration, the varying lengths of time of the
an&aelig;sthesia, and the varying severity of the operations.</p>

<p>During the Crimean War, according to Baudens and Quesnoy, 30,000
operations were done under chloroform, but only one death occurred
attributable to the an&aelig;sthetic. Sansom<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> puts the average mortality at
&middot;75 per 10,000, Nussbaum at 1&middot;3, Richardson at 2&middot;8,<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Morgan<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> at 3&middot;4.
In the American war of secession, in 11,000 operations, there were seven
deaths&mdash;that is, 6&middot;3 per 10,000, the highest number on a large scale which
appears to be on record. In the ten years 1883-1892, 103 deaths are
attributed to chloroform in England and Wales, viz., 88 deaths (57 males,
31 females) from accidents (no doubt in its use as a general an&aelig;sthetic), 14
(9 males, 5 females) from suicide, and a solitary case of murder.</p>

resolved to commit suicide by chloroform, a commencing amaurosis
having preyed upon his mind, and his choice having been determined
by witnessing an accidental death by this agent. He accordingly
plugged his nostrils, fitted on to the face an appropriate mask, and
fastened it by strips of adhesive plaster. In such an instance, there
could be no doubt of the suicidal intent, and the question of accident
would be entirely out of the question.</p>

<p>There is a vulgar idea that it is possible, by holding a cloth saturated
with chloroform to the mouth of a sleeping person (or one, indeed, perfectly
awake), to produce <i>sudden</i> insensibility; but such an occurrence
is against all experimental and clinical evidence. It is true that a
nervous person might, under such circumstances, faint and become
insensible by mere nervous shock; but a true sudden narcosis is
impossible.</p>

<p>Dolbeau has made some interesting experiments in order to ascertain
whether, under any circumstances, a sleeping person might be an&aelig;sthetised.
The main result appears to answer the question in the affirmative, at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
with certain persons; but even with these, it can only be done by using
the greatest skill and care, first allowing the sleeper to breathe very dilute
chloroform vapour, and then gradually exhibiting stronger doses, and
taking the cloth or inhaler away on the slightest symptom of approaching
wakefulness. In 75 per cent. of the cases, however, the individuals
awoke almost immediately on being exposed to the vapour. This cautious
and scientific narcosis, then, is not likely to be used by the criminal class,
or, if used, to be successful.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_185" id="Sect_185"></a>&sect; 185. <b>Physiological Effects.</b>&mdash;Chloroform is a protoplasmic poison.
According to Jumelle, plants can even be narcotised, ceasing to assimilate
and no longer being sensitive to the stimulus of light. Isolated animal
cells, like leucocytes, lose through chloroform vapour their power of spontaneous
movement, and many bacteria cease to multiply if in contact
with chloroform water. According to Binx, chloroform narcosis in man
is to be explained through its producing a weak coagulation of the cerebral
ganglion cells. As already mentioned, chloroform has an affinity for
the red blood-corpuscles. Chloroform stimulates the peripheral ends of
the nerves of sensation, so that it causes irritation of the skin or mucous
membranes when locally applied. Flourens considers that chloroform
first affects the cerebrum, then the cerebellum, and finally the spinal cord;
the action is at first stimulating, afterwards paralysing. Most an&aelig;sthetics
diminish equally the excitability of the grey and the white nervous substance
of the brain, and this is the case with chloroform, ether, and morphine;
but apparently this is not the case with chloral hydrate, which
only diminishes the conductivity of the cortical substance of the brain,
and leaves the grey substance intact. Corresponding to the cerebral paralysis,
the blood pressure sinks, and the heart beats slower and weaker.<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>
The Hyderabad Commission made 735 researches on dogs and monkeys,
and found that in fatal narcosis, so far as these animals are concerned,
the respiration ceased before the heart, and this may be considered the
normal mode of death; but it is probably going too far to say that it is
the exclusive form of death in man, for there have been published cases
in which the heart failed first.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p><a name="Sect_186" id="Sect_186"></a>&sect; 186. <b>Symptoms.</b>&mdash;There is but little outward difference between
man and animals, in regard to the symptoms caused by breathing chloroform;
in the former we have the advantage that the sensations preceding
narcosis can be described by the individual.</p>

<p>The action of chloroform is usually divided into three more or less
distinct stages. In the <i>first</i> there is a &#8220;drunken&#8221; condition, changes
in the sense of smell and taste, and it may be hallucinations of vision
and hearing; there are also often curious creeping sensations about the
skin, and sometimes excessive muscular action, causing violent struggles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
I have also seen epileptiform convulsions, and delirium is almost always
present. The face during this stage is generally flushed, covered with
perspiration, and the pupils contracted. The first stage may last from
one minute to several, and passes into the <i>second stage</i>, or that of depression.
Spontaneous movements cease, sensibility to all external stimuli
vanishes, the patient falls into a deep sleep, the consciousness is entirely
lost, and reflex movements are more and more annihilated. The temperature
is less than normal, the respirations are slow, and the pulse is full
and slow. The pupils in this stage are usually dilated, all the muscles
are relaxed, and the limbs can be bent about in any direction. If now
the inhalation of chloroform is intermitted, the patient wakes within a
period which is usually from twenty to forty minutes, but may be several
hours, after the last inhalation.</p>

<p>The <i>third stage</i> is that of paralysis; the pulse becomes irregular, the
respirations superficial, there is a cyanotic colouring of the lips and skin,
while the pupils become widely dilated. Death follows quickly through
paralysis of the respiratory centre, the respirations first ceasing, then the
pulse; in a few cases, the heart ceases first to beat.</p>

<p>According to Sansom&#8217;s facts,<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> in 100 cases of death by chloroform,
44&middot;6 per cent. occurred before the full narcosis had been attained, that is
in the first stage, 34&middot;7 during the second stage, and 20&middot;6 shortly after.
So, also, Kappeler has recorded that in 101 cases of death from chloroform,
47&middot;7 per cent. occurred before the full effect, and 52&middot;2 during the
full effect. This confirms the dictum of Billroth, that in all stages of
an&aelig;sthesia by chloroform, death may occur. The <i>quantity</i> of chloroform,
which, when inhaled in a given time, will produce death, is unknown;
for all depends upon the greater or less admixture of air, and probably
on other conditions. It has been laid down, that the inhalation of
chloroform should be so managed as to insure that the air breathed shall
never contain more than 3&middot;9 per cent. of chloroform. Fifteen drops
have caused death, but Taylor, on the other hand, records a case of
tetanus, treated at Guy&#8217;s Hospital, in which no less a quantity than 700
grms. (22&middot;5 ozs.) was inhaled in twenty-four hours. Frequent breathing
of chloroform in no way renders the individual safe from fatal accident.
A lady<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> having repeatedly taken chloroform, was an&aelig;sthetised by the
same agent merely for the purpose of having a tooth extracted. About
6 grms. (1&middot;5 drm.) were poured on a cloth, and after nine to ten inspirations,
dangerous symptoms began&mdash;rattling breathing and convulsive
movements&mdash;and, despite all remedies, she died.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_189" id="Sect_189"></a>&sect; 189. <b>The detection and estimation of chloroform</b> from organic
substances is not difficult, its low boiling-point causing it to distil readily.
Accordingly (whatever may be the ultimate modifications, as suggested
by different experimenters), the first step is to bring the substances, unless
fluid, into a pulp with water, and submit this pulp to distillation by
the heat of a water-bath. If the liquid operated upon possesses no
particular odour, the chloroform may in this way be recognised in the
distillate, which, if necessary, may be redistilled in the same manner,
so as to concentrate the volatile matters in a small compass.</p>

<p>There are four chief tests for the identification of chloroform:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1.) The final distillate is tested with a little aniline, and an alcoholic
solution of soda or potash lye; either immediately, or upon gently
warming the liquid, there is a peculiar and penetrating odour of phenylcarbylamine,
<span class="chemform">C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NC</span>; it is produced by the following reaction:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="chemreact">CHCl<sub>3</sub> + 3KOH + C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NH<sub>2</sub> = C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NC + 3KCl + 3H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

<p>Chloral, trichloracetic acid, bromoform and iodoform also give the same
reaction; on the other hand, ethylidene chloride does not yield under
these circumstances any carbylamine (isonitrile).</p>

<p>(2.) Chloroform reduces Fehling&#8217;s alkaline copper solution, <i>when applied
to a distillate</i>, thus excluding a host of more fixed bodies which have
the same reaction; it is a very excellent test, and may be made quantitative.
The reaction is as follows:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="chemreact">CHCl<sub>3</sub> + 5KHO + 2CuO = Cu<sub>2</sub>O + K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + 3KCl + 3H<sub>2</sub>O;</p>

<p>thus, every 100 parts of cuprous oxide equals 83&middot;75 of chloroform.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>(3.) The fluid to be tested (which, if acid, should be neutralised), is
distilled in a slow current of hydrogen, and the vapour conducted
through a short bit of red-hot combustion-tube containing platinum
gauze. Under these circumstances, the chloroform is decomposed and
hydrochloric acid formed; hence, the issuing vapour has an acid reaction
to test-paper, and if led into a solution of silver nitrate, gives the
usual precipitate of argentic chloride. Every 100 parts of silver chloride
equal 27&middot;758 of chloroform.</p>

<p>(4.) The fluid is mixed with a little thymol and potash; if chloroform
be present, a reddish-violet colour is developed, becoming more distinct
on the application of heat.<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

by Schmiedeberg<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> is, however, the best. A combustion-tube of
24 to 26 cm. long, and 10 to 12 mm. in diameter, open at both ends, is
furnished at the one end with a plug of asbestos, while the middle
part, to within 5-6 cm. of the other end, is filled with pieces of
caustic lime, from the size of a lentil to that of half a pea. The
lime must be pure, and is made by heating a carbonate which has
been precipitated from calcic nitrate. The other end of the tube is
closed by a cork, carrying a silver tube, 16-18 cm. long, and 4 mm.
thick. The end containing the asbestos plug is fitted by a cork to a
glass tube. The combustion-tube thus prepared is placed in the ordinary
combustion-furnace; the flask containing the chloroform is adapted,
and the distillation slowly proceeded with. It is best to add a tube,
bent at right angles and going to the bottom of the flask, to draw air
continuously through the apparatus. During the whole process, the tube
containing the lime is kept at a red heat. The chloroform is decomposed,
and the chlorine combines with the lime. The resulting calcic chloride,
mixed with much unchanged lime, is, at the end of the operation, cooled,
dissolved in dilute nitric acid, and precipitated with silver nitrate. Any
silver chloride is collected and weighed and calculated into chloroform.<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

clean copper wire. Since any chloroform is burnt up in the hydrogen
flame to hydrochloric acid, the chloride of copper immediately
volatilises and colours the flame green.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>Chloral hydrate completely volatilises, and can be distilled in a vacuum
without change. If, however, boiled in air, it undergoes slow decomposition,
the first portions of the distillate being overhydrated, the last
underhydrated; the boiling-point, therefore, undergoes a continuous
rise. The amount of hydration of a commercial sample is of practical
importance; if too much water is present, the chloral deliquesces, especially
in warm weather; if too little, it may become acid, and in part
insoluble from the formation of meta-chloral (<span class="chemform">C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>3</sub>Cl<sub>9</sub>O<sub>3</sub></span>). Chloral
hydrate, by the action of the volatile or fixed alkalies, is decomposed, an
alkaline formiate and chloroform resulting thus<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="chemreact">C<sub>2</sub>HCl<sub>3</sub>O,H<sub>2</sub>O + NaHO = NaCHO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + CHCl<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>Trichlor-acetic acid is decomposed in a similar manner.</p>

<p><b>Statistics.</b>&mdash;Chloral caused, during the ten years 1883-1892 in
England and Wales, 127 deaths&mdash;viz., 111 (89 males, 22 females)
accidentally, 15 (14 males, 1 female) from suicide, and a case in which
chloral was the agent of murder.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_196" id="Sect_196"></a>&sect; 196. <b>Detection.</b>&mdash;It is, of course, obvious that after splitting up
chloral into chloroform, the latter can be detected by distillation and
applying the tests given at <a href="#Page_152">p. 152</a> and <i>seq.</i> Chloral hydrate is soluble
in one and a half times its weight of water; the solution should be
perfectly neutral to litmus. It is also soluble in ether, in alcohol, and
in carbon disulphide. It may be extracted from its solution by shaking
out with ether. There should be no cloudiness when a solution is tested
with silver nitrate in the cold; if, however, to a boiling solution nitrate
of silver and a little ammonia are added, there is a mirror of reduced
silver.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_197" id="Sect_197"></a>&sect; 197. The assay of chloral hydrate in solutions is best effected by
distilling the solution with slaked lime; the distillate is received in
water contained in a graduated tube kept at a low temperature. The
chloroform sinks to the bottom, and is directly read off; the number of
c.c. multiplied by 2&middot;064 equals the weight of the chloral hydrate
present.</p>

<p>Another method, accurate but only applicable to the fairly pure substance,
is to dissolve 1 to 2 grms. in water, remove any free acid by baric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
carbonate, and then treat the liquid thus purified by a known volume of
standard soda. The soda is now titrated
back, using litmus as an indicator, each c.c.
of normal alkali neutralised by the sample
corresponds to 0&middot;1655 grm. of chloral hydrate.
Small quantities of chloral hydrate
may be conveniently recovered from complex
liquids by shaking them up with ether,
and removing the ethereal layer, in the
tube represented in the <a href="#Fig_191">figure</a>.<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> The ether
must be allowed to evaporate spontaneously;
but there is in this way much loss of
chloral. The best method of estimating
minute quantities is to alkalise the liquid,
and slowly distil the vapour through a red-hot
combustion-tube charged with pure
lime, as in the process described at <a href="#Page_153">p. 153</a>.
A dilute solution of chloral may also be
treated with a zinc-copper couple, the
nascent hydrogen breaks the molecule up,
and the resulting chloride may be titrated,
as in water analyses, by silver nitrate and
potassic chromate.</p>

repeated:&mdash;A is a tube of any dimensions most convenient to the analyst.
Ordinary burette size will perhaps be the most suitable for routine
work; the tube is furnished with a stopcock and is bent at B, the tube
at K having a very small but not quite capillary bore. The lower end is
attached to a length of pressure-tubing, and is connected with a small
reservoir of mercury, moving up and down by means of a pulley. To use
the apparatus: Fill the tube with mercury by opening the clamp at H, and
the stopcock at B, and raising the reservoir until the mercury, if
allowed, would flow out of the beak. Now, the beak is dipped into the
liquid to be extracted with the solvent, and by lowering the reservoir,
a strong vacuum is created, which draws the liquid into the tube; in the
same way the ether is made to follow. Should the liquid be so thick that
it is not possible to get it in by means of suction, the lower end of
the tube is disconnected, and the syrupy mass worked in through the wide
end. When the ether has been sucked into the apparatus, it is emptied of
mercury by lowering the reservoir, and then firmly clamped at H, and the
stopcock also closed. The tube may now be shaken, and then allowed to
stand for the liquids to separate. When there is a good line of
demarcation, by raising the reservoir after opening the clamp and
stopcock, the whole of the light solvent can be run out of the tube into
a flask or beaker, and recovered by distillation. For heavy solvents
(such as chloroform), which sink to the bottom, a simple burette, with a
fine exit tube is preferable; but for petroleum ether, ordinary ether,
&amp;c., the apparatus figured is extremely useful.</p>

Animals.</b>&mdash;Experiments on animals have taught us all that is known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
of the physiological action of chloral. It has been shown that the drug
influences very considerably the circulation, at first exciting the heart&#8217;s
action, and then paralysing the automatic centre. The heart, as in
animals poisoned by atropine, stops in diastole, and the blood-pressure
sinks in proportion to the progressive paralysis of the cardiac centre. At
the same time, the respiration is slowed and finally ceases, while the
heart continues to beat. The body temperature of the warm-blooded
animals is very remarkably depressed, according to Falck, even to 7&middot;6&deg;.
Vomiting has been rather frequently observed with dogs and cats, even
when the drug has been taken into the system by subcutaneous injection.</p>

<p>The secretion of milk, according to R&ouml;hrig, is also diminished. Reflex
actions through small doses are intensified; through large, much
diminished. &middot;025-&middot;05 grm. (&middot;4-&middot;7 grain), injected subcutaneously into
frogs, causes a slowing of the respiration, a diminution of reflex excitability,
and lastly, its complete cessation; this condition lasts several
hours; at length the animal returns to its normal state. If the dose is
raised to &middot;1 grm. (1&middot;5 grain) after the cessation of reflex movements, the
heart is paralysed&mdash;and a paralysis not due to any central action of the
vagus, but to a direct action on the cardiac ganglia. Rabbits of the
ordinary weight of 2 kilos. are fully narcotised by the subcutaneous
injection of 1 grm.; the sleep is very profound, and lasts several hours;
the animal wakes up spontaneously, and is apparently none the worse.
If 2 grms. are administered, the narcotic effects, rapidly developed, are
much prolonged. There is a remarkable diminution of temperature, and
the animal dies, the respiration ceasing without convulsion or other sign.
Moderate-sized dogs require 6 grms. for a full narcosis, and the symptoms
are similar; they also wake after many hours, in apparent good health.<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p><a name="Sect_199" id="Sect_199"></a>&sect; 199. Liebreich considered that the action of chloral was due to its
being broken up by the alkali of the blood, and the system being thus
brought into a state precisely similar to its condition when an&aelig;sthetised
by chloroform vapour. This view has, however, been proved to be
erroneous. Chloral hydrate can, it is true, be decomposed in some degree
by the blood at 40&deg;; but the action must be prolonged for several hours.
A 1 per cent. solution of alkali does not decompose chloral at a blood-heat
in the time within which chloral acts in the body; and since narcotic
effects are commonly observed when, in the fatty group, hydrogen has
been displaced by chlorine, it is more probable that chloral hydrate is
absorbed and circulates in the blood as such, and is not broken up into
chloroform and an alkaline formiate.</p>

traumatic tetanus, in which M. Ore injected into the veins 9 grms. of
chloral in 10 grms. of water, there was profound insensibility, lasting
eleven hours, during which time a painful operation on the thumb was
performed. The next day 10 grms. were injected, when the insensibility
lasted eight hours; and 9 grms. were injected on each of the two
following days. The man recovered. In another case, Ore an&aelig;sthetised
immediately a patient by plunging the subcutaneous needle of his syringe
into the radial vein, and injected 10 grms. of chloral hydrate with 30
of water. The patient became insensible before the whole quantity was
injected with &#8220;<i>une immobilit&eacute; rappellant celle du cadavre</i>.&#8221; On
finishing the operation, the patient was roused immediately by the

precise quantity of chloral which may cause death. Children bear it
better, in proportion, than adults, while old persons (especially those
with weak hearts, and those inclined to apoplexy) are likely to be strongly
affected by very small doses. A dose of &middot;19 grm. (3 grains) has been
fatal to a child a year old in ten hours. On the other hand, according
to Bouchut&#8217;s observations on 10,000 children, he considers that the full
therapeutic effect of chloral can be obtained safely with them in the

<p>These doses are certainly too high, and it would be dangerous to take
them as a guide, since death has occurred in a child, aged 5, from a dose
of 3 grms. (46&middot;3 grains). Medical men in England consider 20 grains a
very full dose for a child of four years old, and 50 for an adult, while a
case is recorded in which a dose of 1&middot;9 grm. (30 grains) proved fatal in
thirty-five hours to a young lady aged 20. On the other hand, we find
a case<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> in which, to a patient suffering from epileptic mania, a dose of
31&middot;1 grms. (1&middot;1 oz.) of chloral hydrate was administered; she sank into a
deep sleep in five minutes. Subcutaneous injections of strychnine were
applied, and after sleeping for forty-eight hours, there was recovery. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the third day a vivid scarlatinal rash appeared, followed by desquamation.
The examples quoted&mdash;the fatal dose of 1&middot;9 grm., and recovery from 31
grms.&mdash;are the two extremes for adults. From other cases, it appears
tolerably plain that most people would recover, especially with appropriate
treatment, from a single dose under 8 grms., but anything above that
quantity taken at one time would be very dangerous, and doses of 10
grms. and above, almost always fatal. If, however, 8 grms. were taken in
divided doses during the twenty-four hours, it could (according to Sir
B. W. Richardson) be done with safety. The time from the taking of the
poison till death varies considerably, and is in part dependent on the dose.</p>

<p>In seven cases of lethal poisoning, three persons who took the small
doses of 1&middot;25, 2&middot;5, and 1&middot;95 grms. respectively, lived from eight to ten
hours; two, taking 4 and 5 grms. respectively, died very shortly after
the administration of the chloral. In a sixth case, related by Brown, in
which 3&middot;12 grms. had been taken, the patient lived an hour; and in
another, after a dose of 5 grms., recorded by Jolly, death took place
within a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_202" id="Sect_202"></a>&sect; 202. <b>Symptoms.</b>&mdash;With moderate doses there are practically no
symptoms, save a drowsiness coming on imperceptibly, and followed by
heavy sleep. With doses up to 2 grms. (30&middot;8 grains), the hypnotic state
is perfectly under the command of the will, and if the person chooses to
walk about or engage in any occupation, he can ward off sleep; but with
those doses which lead to danger, the narcosis is completely uncontrollable,
the appearance of the sleeper is often strikingly like that of a
drunken person. There is great diminution of temperature commencing
in from five to twenty minutes after taking the dose&mdash;occasionally sleep
is preceded by a delirious state. During the deep slumber the face is
much flushed, and in a few cases the sleep passes directly into death
without any marked change. In others, symptoms of collapse appear,
and the patient sinks through exhaustion.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_203" id="Sect_203"></a>&sect; 203. With some persons doses, which, in themselves, are insufficient
to cause death, yet have a peculiar effect on the mental faculties. A case
of great medico-legal interest is described by the patient himself, Dr.
Manjot.<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> He took in three doses, hourly, 12 grms. of chloral hydrate.
After the first dose the pain, for which he had recourse to chloral,
vanished; but Manjot, although he had all the appearance of being perfectly
conscious, yet had not the slightest knowledge of what he was
doing or speaking. He took the other two doses, and sank into a deep
sleep which lasted twelve hours. He then awoke and answered questions
with difficulty, but could not move; he lay for the next twelve
hours in a half slumber, and the following night slept soundly&mdash;to wake
up recovered.</p>

successful is that by strychnine injections, and the application of warmth
to counteract the loss of temperature which is so constant a phenomenon.
As an illustration of the treatment by strychnine, an interesting case

<p>A man, thirty-five years old, took at one dose, for the purpose of suicide,
24 grms. of chloral hydrate. In half an hour afterwards he was found
in a deep sleep, with flushed face, swollen veins, and a pulse 160 in the
minute. After a further half hour, the congestion of the head was still
more striking; the temperature was 39&middot;5&deg;; the pulse hard and bounding
92; the breathing laboured, at times intermittent.</p>

<p>Artificial respiration was at once commenced, but in spite of this, in
about another half hour, the face became deadly pale, the temperature
sank to 32&middot;9&deg;. The pupils contracted, and the pulse was scarcely to be
felt; 3 mgrms. (&middot;04 grain) of strychnine were now injected subcutaneously;
this caused tetanic convulsions in the upper part of the body and
trismus. The heart&#8217;s action again became somewhat stronger, the temperature
rose to 33&middot;3&deg;, and the pupils dilated; but soon followed, again,
depression of the heart&#8217;s action, and the respiration could only be kept
going by faradisation. Two mgrms. (&middot;03 grain) of strychnine were once
more injected, and the heart&#8217;s action improved. During the succeeding
six hours the respiration had to be assisted by faradisation. The temperature
gradually rose to 36&middot;5&deg;; ten hours after taking the dose the
patient lay in a deep sleep, breathing spontaneously and reacting to
external stimuli with a temperature of 38&middot;5&deg;. Eighteen hours from the
commencement, the respiration again became irregular, and the galvanic
current was anew applied. The last application aroused the sleeper, he
took some milk and again slept; after twenty-seven hours he could be
awakened by calling, &amp;c., but had not full consciousness; he again took
some milk and sank to sleep. It was not until thirty-two hours had
elapsed from the ingestion of the poison that he awoke spontaneously;
there were no after effects.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_205" id="Sect_205"></a>&sect; 205. <b>Chronic Poisoning by Chloral Hydrate.</b>&mdash;An enormous number
of people habitually take chloral hydrate. The history of the habit
is usually that some physician has given them a chloral prescription for
neuralgia, for loss of sleep, or other cause, and finding that they can
conjure sleep, oblivion, and loss (it may be) of suffering whenever they
choose, they go on repeating it from day to day until it becomes a necessity
of their existence. A dangerous facility to chloral-drinking is the
existence of patent medicines, advertised as sleep-producers, and containing
chloral as the active ingredient. A lady, aged 35, died in 1876, at
Exeter, from an overdose of &#8220;Hunter&#8217;s solution of chloral, or sedative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>

<p>The evil results of this chloral-drinking are especially to be looked for
in the mental faculties, and the alienists have had since 1869 a new
insanity-producing factor. In the asylums may usually be found several
cases of melancholia and mania referred rightly (or wrongly) to chloral-drinking.
Symptoms other than cerebral are chilliness of the body,
inclination to fainting, clonic convulsions, and a want of co-ordination
of the muscles of the lower extremities. In a case recorded by
Husband,<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> a lady, after twelve days&#8217; treatment by chloral hydrate, in
doses of from 1 to 2 grms. (15&middot;4 to 30&middot;8 grains), suffered from a scarlatina-like
rash, which was followed by desquamation. Among the
insane, it has also been noticed that its use has been followed by nettle-rash
and petechi&aelig; (Reimer and others).</p>

urine partly as urochloral acid (<span class="chemform">C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>11</sub>Cl<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub></span>). Butylchloral is separated
as butyl urochloral acid (<span class="chemform">C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>15</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub></span>). Urochloral acid is crystalline,
soluble in water, in alcohol, and in ether, reduces copper from Fehling&#8217;s
solution, and rotates a ray of polarised light to the left. Urochloral
acid, on boiling with either dilute sulphuric or hydrochloric acid, splits
up into trichlorethyl alcohol and glycuronic acid<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="chemreact">C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>11</sub>Cl<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O = C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>Cl<sub>3</sub>O + C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>7</sub>.</p>

<p>Trichloralcohol is an oily fluid (boiling-point 150&deg;-152&deg;); it yields by
oxidation trichloracetic acid.</p>

<p>Urobutyl chloral acid gives on treatment with mineral acids trichlorbutyl
alcohol and glycuronic acid.</p>

<p>To separate urochloral acid from the urine the following process has
been found successful:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The urine is evaporated to a syrup at the heat of the water-bath, and
then strongly acidulated with sulphuric acid and repeatedly shaken out
in a separating tube with a mixture of 3 vols. of ether and 1 vol. of
alcohol. The ether-alcohol is separated and distilled off, the acid residue
is neutralised with <span class="chemform">KHO</span>, or potassic carbonate, and evaporated; the dry
mass is then taken up with 90 per cent. alcohol, the filtrate precipitated
with ether, and the precipitate washed with ether and absolute alcohol.</p>

<p>Next the precipitate is boiled with absolute alcohol and filtered hot.
On cooling, the potassium salt of urochloral acid separates out in tufts of
silky needles. The crystals are dried over sulphuric acid and again
washed several times with absolute alcohol and ether to remove
impurities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>To obtain the free acid, the potassium salt is dissolved in a little water
and acidulated with hydrochloric acid; the liquid is then shaken out in
a separating tube, with a mixture of 8 vols. of ether and 1 of alcohol.
The ether-alcohol is distilled off, the residue treated with moist silver
oxide until no farther separation of silver chloride occurs, the silver
chloride is separated by filtration, the soluble silver salt decomposed by
<span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>, and the filtrate carefully evaporated to a syrup; after a few hours,
the acid crystallises in stars of needles.</p>

<p>Urobutylchloral acid can be obtained in quite a similar way.<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

most convenient to place the organic fluid or pulped-up solid, mixed
with water, in a retort, to acidify with tartaric acid, and to distil.</p>

<p>Chloral hydrate distils over from a liquid acidified with tartaric acid;
to obtain the whole of the chloral requires distillation in a vacuum almost
to dryness.</p>

<p>The distillation will, unless there is also some partly decomposed
chloral, not smell of chloroform, and yet give chloroform reactions.</p>

<p>To identify it, to the distillate should be added a little burnt magnesia,
and the distillate thus treated boiled for half an hour in a flask connected
with an inverted condenser; in this way the chloral hydrate is changed
into chloroform and magnesium formate<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Chloral (or chloroform), when boiled with resorcinol and the liquid
made strongly alkaline with <span class="chemform">NaHO</span>, gives a red colour, which disappears
on acidifying and is restored by alkalies. If, on the other hand, there is
an excess of resorcinol and only a very small quantity of <span class="chemform">NaHO</span> used, the
product shows a yellowish-green fluorescence; <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub> of a milligramme

are filtered or submitted to dialysis, and the test applied direct. If
chloral is present, there is first an orange-yellow colour; on standing, the
fluid becomes more and more brown, then troubled, an amorphous precipitate
falls to the bottom, and a peculiar odour is developed. With 10
mgrms. of chloral in 1 c.c. of water, there is an evident precipitate, and
the odour can readily be perceived; with 1 mgrm. dissolved in 1 c.c. of
water, there is an orange-yellow colour, and also the odour, but no
precipitate; with &middot;1 mgrm. in 1 c.c. of water, there is a weak, pale,
straw-yellow colour, which can scarcely be called characteristic. The
only substance giving in neutral solutions the same reactions is antimony;
but, on the addition of a few drops of acid, the antimony
falls as an orange-yellow precipitate, while, if chloral alone is present,
there is a light white precipitate of sulphur.</p>

<h3>VIII.&mdash;Bisulphide of Carbon.</h3>

<p><a name="Sect_208" id="Sect_208"></a>&sect; 208. Bisulphide of carbon&mdash;<i>carbon disulphide</i>, <i>carbon sulphide</i>
(<span class="chemform">CS<sub>2</sub></span>)&mdash;is a colourless, volatile fluid, strongly refracting light. Commercial
samples have a most repulsive and penetrating odour, but chemically
pure carbon sulphide has a smell which is not disagreeable.
The boiling-point is 47&deg;; the specific gravity at 0&deg; is 1&middot;293. It is
very inflammable, burning with a blue flame, and evolving sulphur
dioxide; is little soluble in water, but mixes easily with alcohol or
ether. Bisulphide of carbon, on account of its solvent powers for
sulphur, phosphorus, oils, resins, caoutchouc, gutta-percha, &amp;c., is in
great request in certain industries. It is also utilised for disinfecting
purposes, the liquid being burnt in a lamp.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_209" id="Sect_209"></a>&sect; 209. <b>Poisoning by Carbon Bisulphide.</b>&mdash;In spite of the cheapness
and numerous applications of this liquid, poisoning is very rare. There
appears to be a case on record of attempted self-destruction by this
agent, in which a man took 2 ozs. (56&middot;7 c.c.) of the liquid, but without
a fatal result. The symptoms in this case were pallor of the face,
wide pupils, frequent and weak pulse, lessened bodily temperature,
and spasmodic convulsions. Carbon disulphide was detected in the
breath by leading the expired air through an alcoholic solution of triethyl-phosphin,
with which it struck a red colour. It could also be
found in the urine in the same way. An intense burning in the throat,
giddiness, and headache lasted for several days.</p>

poisoning by carbon disulphide, occasionally met with in manufactures
necessitating the daily use of large quantities for dissolving caoutchouc,
&amp;c. When taken thus in the form of vapour daily for some time, it gives
rise to a complex series of symptoms which may be divided into two
principal stages&mdash;viz., a stage of excitement and one of depression. In
the first phase, there is more or less permanent headache, with considerable
indigestion, and its attendant loss of appetite, nausea, &amp;c. The
sensitiveness of the skin is also heightened, and there are curious
sensations of creeping, &amp;c. The mind at the same time in some degree
suffers, the temper becomes irritable, and singing in the ears and noises
in the head have been noticed. In one factory a workman suffered from
an acute mania, which subsided in two days upon removing him from the
noxious vapour (<i>Eulenberg</i>). The sleep is disturbed by dreams, and,
according to Delpech,<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> there is considerable sexual excitement, but this
statement has in no way been confirmed. Pains in the limbs are a

recorded by Bernhardt,<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> a girl, twenty-two years old, who had worked
six weeks in a caoutchouc factory, suffered from mental weakness and
digestive troubles; there was an&aelig;sthesia and algesis of the whole skin.
In these advanced cases the mental debility is very pronounced, and there
is also weakness of the muscular system. Paralysis of the lower limbs
has been noted, and in one instance a man had his right hand paralysed
for two months. It seems uncertain how long a person is likely to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
suffer from the effects of the vapour after he is removed from its influence.
If the first stage of poisoning only is experienced, then recovery
is generally rapid; but if mental and muscular weakness and an&aelig;sthesia
of the skin have been developed, a year has been known to elapse without
any considerable improvement, and permanent injury to the health may
be feared.</p>

<h3>IX.&mdash;The Tar Acids&mdash;Phenol&mdash;Cresol.</h3>

<p><a name="Sect_216" id="Sect_216"></a>&sect; 216. <b>Carbolic Acid. Syn. Phenol, Phenyl Alcohol, Phenylic
Hydrate; Phenic Acid; Coal-Tar Creasote.</b>&mdash;The formula for carbolic
acid is <span class="chemform">C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>HO</span>. The pure substance appears at the ordinary temperature
as a colourless solid, crystallising in long prisms; the fusibility of
the crystals is given variously by different authors: from my own observation,
the pure crystals melt at 40&deg;-41&deg;, any lower melting-point being due
to the presence of cresylic acid or other impurity; the crystals again
become solid about 15&deg;. Melted carbolic acid forms a colourless limpid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
fluid, sinking in water. It boils under the ordinary pressure at 182&deg;,
and distils without decomposition; it is very readily and completely
distilled in a vacuum at about the temperature of 100&deg;. After the
crystals have been exposed to the air, they absorb water, and a hydrate
is formed containing 16&middot;07 per cent. of water. The hydrate melts at 17&deg;,
any greater hydration prevents the crystallisation of the acid; a carbolic
acid, containing about 27 per cent. of water, and probably corresponding to
the formula <span class="chemform">C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O,2H<sub>2</sub>O</span>, is obtained by gradually adding water to
carbolic acid so long as it continues to be dissolved. Such a hydrate
dissolves in 11&middot;1 times its measure of water, and contains 8&middot;56 per cent.
of real carbolic acid. Carbolic acid does not redden litmus, but produces
a greasy stain on paper, disappearing on exposure to the air; it has a
peculiar smell, a burning numbing taste, and in the fluid state it strongly
refracts light. Heated to a high temperature it takes fire, and burns
with a sooty flame.</p>

<p>When an aqueous solution of carbolic acid is shaken up with ether,
benzene, carbon disulphide, or chloroform, it is fully dissolved by the
solvent, and is thus easily separated from most solutions in which it
exists in the free state. Petroleum ether, on the other hand, only
slightly dissolves it in the cold, more on warming. Carbolic acid mixes
in all proportions with glycerin, glacial or acetic acid, and alcohol. It
coagulates albumen, the precipitate being soluble in an excess of albumen;
it also dissolves iodine, without changing its properties. It dissolves
many resins, and also sulphur, but, on boiling, sulphuretted hydrogen is
disengaged. Indigo blue is soluble in hot carbolic acid, and may be
obtained in crystals on cooling. Carbolic acid is contained in castoreum,
a secretion derived from the beaver, but it has not yet been detected in
the vegetable kingdom. The source of carbolic acid is at present coal-tar,
from which it is obtained by a process of distillation. There are,
however, a variety of chemical actions in the course of which carbolic
acid is formed.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_217" id="Sect_217"></a>&sect; 217. The common disinfecting carbolic acid is a dark reddish liquid,
with a very strong odour; at present there is very little phenol in it; it
is mainly composed of meta- and para-cresol. It is officinal in Germany,
and there must contain at least 50 per cent. of the pure carbolic acid.
The pure crystallised carbolic acid is officinal in our own and all the
continental pharmacop&#339;ias. In the British Pharmacop&#339;ia, a solution of
carbolic acid in glycerin is officinal; the proportions are 1 part of carbolic
acid and 4 parts of glycerin, that is, strength by measure = 20 per cent.
The Pharmacop&#339;ia Germanica has a <i>liquor natri carbolici</i>, made with
5 parts carbolic acid, 1 caustic soda, and 4 of water; strength in carbolic
acid = 50 per cent. There is also a strongly alkaline crude sodic carbolate
in use as a preservative of wood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>There are various disinfecting fluids containing amounts of carbolic
acid, from 10 per cent. upwards. Many of these are somewhat complex
mixtures, but, as a rule, any poisonous properties they possess are mainly
due to their content of phenol or cresol. A great variety of disinfecting
powders, under various names, are also in commerce, deriving their
activity from carbolic acid. Macdougall&#8217;s disinfecting powder is made
by adding a certain proportion of impure carbolic acid to a calcic sulphite,
which is prepared by passing sulphur dioxide over ignited limestone.</p>

<p><b>Calvert&#8217;s carbolic acid powder</b> is made by adding carbolic acid to
the siliceous residue obtained from the manufacture of aluminic sulphate
from shale. There are also various carbolates which, by heating or decomposing
with sulphuric acid, give off carbolic acid.</p>

<p><b>Carbolic acid soaps</b> are also made on a large scale&mdash;the acid is free,
and some of the soaps contain as much as 10 per cent. In the inferior
carbolic acid soaps there is little or no carbolic acid, but cresylic takes its
place. Neither the soaps nor the powders have hitherto attained any
toxicological importance, but the alkaline carbolates are very poisonous.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_218" id="Sect_218"></a>&sect; 218. <b>The chief uses</b> of carbolic acid are indicated by the foregoing
enumeration of the principal preparations used in medicine and commerce.
The bulk of the carbolic acid manufactured is for the purposes
of disinfection. It is also utilised in the preparation of certain colouring
matters or dyes, and during the last few years has had another application
in the manufacture of salicylic acid. In medicine it is administered
occasionally internally, while the antiseptic movement in surgery,
initiated by Lister, has given it great prominence in surgical operations.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_219" id="Sect_219"></a>&sect; 219. <b>Statistics.</b>&mdash;The tar acids, <i>i.e.</i>, pure carbolic acid and the impure
acids sold under the name of carbolic acid, but consisting (as stated
before) mainly of cresol, are, of all powerful poisons, the most accessible,
and the most recklessly distributed. We find them at the bedside of the
sick, in back-kitchens, in stables, in public and private closets and urinals,
and, indeed, in almost all places where there are likely to be foul odours
or decomposing matters. It is, therefore, no wonder that poisoning by
carbolic acid has, of late years, assumed large proportions. The acid has
become vulgarised, and quite as popularly known, as the most common
household drugs or chemicals.<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> This familiarity is the growth of a very
few years, since it was not discovered until 1834, and does not seem to
have been used by Lister until about 1863. It was not known to the
people generally until much later. At present it occupies the third place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
in fatality of all poisons in England. The following table shows that, in
the past ten years, carbolic acid has killed 741 people, either accidentally
or suicidally; there is also one case of murder by carbolic acid within
the same period, bringing the total up to 742:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_196" id="Footnote_196"></a><a href="#FNanchor_196"><span class="label">[196]</span></a> Although this is so, yet much ignorance still prevails as to its
real nature. In a case reported in the <i>Pharm. Journ.</i>, 1881, p. 334, a
woman, thirty years of age, drank two-thirds of an ounce of liquid
labelled &#8220;<i>Pure Carbolic Acid</i>&#8221; by mistake, and died in two hours. She
read the label, and a lodger also read it, but did not know what it
meant.</p>

<p>Falck has collected, since the year 1868, no less than 87 cases of
poisoning from carbolic acid recorded in medical literature. In one of
the cases the individual died in nine hours from a large dose of carbolate
of soda; in a second, violent symptoms were induced by breathing for
three hours carbolic acid vapour; in the remaining 85, the poisoning was
caused by the liquid acid. Of these 85 persons, 7 had taken the poison
with suicidal intent, and of the 7, 5 died; 39 were poisoned through the
medicinal use of carbolic acid, 27 of the 39 by the antiseptic treatment
of wounds by carbolic acid dressings, and of these 8 terminated fatally;
in 8 cases, symptoms of poisoning followed the rubbing or painting of the
acid on the skin for the cure of scabies, favus, or psoriasis, and 6 of these
patients died. In 4 cases, carbolic acid enemata, administered for the purpose
of dislodging ascarides, gave rise to symptoms of poisoning, and in
one instance death followed.</p>

<p>Of these 12, 8 died.</p>

<p>Again, 10 persons took carbolic acid in mistake for various alcoholic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
drinks, such as schnapps, brandy, rum, or beer, and 9 of the 10 succumbed;
17 persons drank carbolic acid simply &#8220;by mistake,&#8221; and of
these 13 died. Thus, of the whole 85 cases, no less than 51 ended
fatally&mdash;nearly 60 per cent.</p>

<p>It must be always borne in mind that, with regard to statistics generally,
the term &#8220;carbolic acid&#8221; is not used by coroners, juries, or
medical men, in a strictly chemical sense, the term being made to include
disinfecting fluids which are almost wholly composed of the cresols, and
contain scarcely any phenol. In this article, with regard to symptoms
and pathological appearances, it is only occasionally possible to state
whether the pure medicinal crystalline phenol or a mixture of tar-acids
was the cause of poisoning.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_220" id="Sect_220"></a>&sect; 220. <b>Fatal Dose.</b>&mdash;The minimum fatal dose for cats, dogs, and
rabbits, appears to be from &middot;4 to &middot;5 grm. per kilogram. Falck has put the
minimum lethal dose for man at 15 grms. (231&middot;5 grains), which would be
about &middot;2 per kilo., basing his estimate on the following reasoning. In
33 cases he had a fairly exact record of the amount of acid taken, and
out of the 33, he selects only those cases which are of use for the
decision of the question. Among adults, in 5 cases the dose was 30 grms.,
and all the 5 cases terminated by death, in times varying from five
minutes to an hour and a half. By other 5 adults a dose of 15 grms.
was taken; of the 5, 3 men and a woman died, in times varying from
forty-five minutes to thirty hours, while 1 woman recovered. Doses of
11&middot;5, 10&middot;8, and 9 grms. were taken by different men, and recovered from;
on the other hand, a suicide who took one and a half teaspoonful (about
6 grms.) of the concentrated acid, died in fifty minutes. Doses of &middot;3 to
3 grms. have caused symptoms of poisoning, but the patients recovered,
while higher doses than 15 grms. in 12 cases, with only one exception,
caused death. Hence, it may be considered tolerably well established,
that 15 grms. (231&middot;5 grains) may be taken as representing the minimum
lethal dose.</p>

<p>The largest dose from which a person appears to have recovered is, I
believe, that given in a case recorded by Davidson, in which 150 grms.
of crude carbolic acid had been taken. It must, however, be remembered
that, as this was the impure acid, probably only half of it was really carbolic
acid. The German Pharmacop&#339;ia prescribes as a maximum dose
&middot;05 grm (&middot;7 grain) of the crystallised acid, and a daily maximum quantity
given in divided doses of &middot;15 grm. (2&middot;3 grains).</p>

<p><a name="Sect_221" id="Sect_221"></a>&sect; 221. <b>Effects on Animals.</b>&mdash;Carbolic acid is poisonous to both animal
and vegetable life.</p>

<p><b>Infusoria.</b>&mdash;One part of the acid in 10,000 parts of water rapidly kills
ciliated animalcules,&mdash;the movements become sluggish, the sarcode
substance darker, and the cilia in a little time cease moving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Fish.</b>&mdash;One part of the acid in 7000 of water kills dace, minnows,
roach, and gold fish. In this amount of dilution the effect is not
apparent immediately; but, at the end of a few hours, the movements of
the fish become sluggish, they frequently rise to the surface to breathe,
and at the end of twenty-four hours are found dead. Quantities of carbolic
acid, such as 1 part in 100,000 of water, appear to affect the
health of fish, and render them more liable to be attacked by the fungus
growth which is so destructive to fish-life in certain years.</p>

<p><b>Frogs.</b>&mdash;If &middot;01 to &middot;02 grm. of carbolic acid be dissolved in a litre of
water in which a frog is placed, there is almost immediately signs of uneasiness
in the animal, showing that pain from local contact is experienced; a
sleepy condition follows, with exaltation of reflex sensibility; convulsions
succeed, generally, though not always; then reflex sensibility is diminished,
ultimately vanishes, and death occurs; the muscles and nerves
still respond to the electric current, and the heart beats, but slowly and
weakly, for a little after the respiration has ceased.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_222" id="Sect_222"></a>&sect; 222. <b>Warm-blooded Animals.</b>&mdash;For a rabbit of the average weight
of 2 kilos., &middot;15 grm. is an active dose, and &middot;3 a lethal dose (that is &middot;15 per
kilo.). The sleepy condition of the frog is not noticed, and the chief
symptoms are clonic convulsions with dilatation of the pupils, the convulsions
passing into death, without a noticeable paralytic stage. The
symptoms observed in poisoned dogs are almost precisely similar, the dose,
according to body-weight, being the same. It has, however, been noticed
that with doses large enough to produce convulsions, a weak condition
has supervened, causing death in several days. There appears to be no
cumulative action, since equal toxic doses can be given to animals for
some time, and the last dose has no greater effect than the first or intermediate
ones. The pathological appearances met with in animals poisoned
by the minimum lethal doses referred to are not characteristic; but there
is a remarkable retardation of putrefaction.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_223" id="Sect_223"></a>&sect; 223. <b>Symptoms in Man, external application.</b>&mdash;A 5 per cent.
solution of carbolic acid, applied to the skin, causes a peculiar numbness,
followed, it may be, by irritation. Young subjects, and those with
sensitive skins, sometimes exhibit a pustular eruption, and concentrated
solutions cause more or less destruction of the skin. Lemaire<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> describes
the action of carbolic acid on the skin as causing a slight inflammation,
with desquamation of the epithelium, followed by a very permanent
brown stain, but this he alone has observed. Applied to the mucous
membrane, carbolic acid turns the epithelial covering white; the epithelium,
however, is soon thrown off, and the place rapidly heals; there is
the same numbing, aconite-like feeling before noticed. The vapour of
carbolic acid causes redness of the conjunctiv&aelig;, and irritation of the air-passages.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
If the application is continued, the mucous membrane swells,
whitens, and pours out an abundant secretion.</p>

<p>Macphail<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> gives two cases of poisoning by carbolic acid from external
use. In the one, a large tumour had been removed from a woman aged
30, and the wound covered with gauze steeped in a solution of carbolic
acid, in glycerin, strength 10 per cent.; subsequently, there was high
fever, with diminished sulphates in the urine, which smelt strongly of
carbolic acid, and was very dark. On substituting boracic acid, none of
these troubles were observed. The second case was that of a servant
suffering from axillary abscess; the wound was syringed out with carbolic
acid solution, of strength 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> per cent., when effects were produced
similar to those in the first case. It was noted that in both these cases
the pulse was slowed. Scattered throughout surgical and medical literature,

estimated by Hoppe-Seyler to be 33&middot;26 grms., and the quantity used by
each to be equal to 13&middot;37 grms. (206 grains) of carbolic acid. One of
the men died; the survivor described his own symptoms as follows:&mdash;He
and his companion stood in front of the fire, and rubbed the lotion in;
he rubbed it into his legs, breast, and the front part of his body; the
other parts were mutually rubbed. Whilst rubbing his right arm, and
drying it before the fire, he felt a burning sensation, a tightness and
giddiness, and mentioned his sensations to his companion, who laughed.
This condition lasted from five to seven minutes, but he did not remember
whether his companion complained of anything, nor did he know what
became of him, nor how he himself came to be in bed. He was found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
holding on to the joiner&#8217;s bench, looking with wide staring eyes, like a
drunken man, and was delirious for half an hour. The following night
he slept uneasily and complained of headache and burning of the skin.
The pulse was 68, the appearance of the urine, appetite, and sense of
taste were normal; the bowels confined. He soon recovered.</p>

<p>The other joiner seems to have died as suddenly as if he had taken
prussic acid. He called to his mother, &#8220;<i>Ich habe einen Rausch</i>,&#8221; and
died with pale livid face, after taking two deep, short inspirations.</p>

<p>The <i>post-mortem</i> examination showed the sinuses filled with much fluid
blood, and the vessels of the pia mater congested. Frothy, dark, fluid
blood was found in the lungs, which were hyper&aelig;mic; the mucous
tissues of the epiglottis and air-tubes were reddened, and covered with a
frothy slime. Both ventricles&mdash;the ven&aelig; cav&aelig; and the vessels of the
spleen and kidneys&mdash;were filled with dark fluid blood. The muscles
were very red; there was no special odour. Hoppe-Seyler recognised
carbolic acid in the blood and different organs of the body.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>In another case, a child died from the outward use of a 2 per cent.
solution of carbolic acid. It is described as follows:&mdash;An infant of
seven weeks old suffered from varicella, and one of the pustules became the
centre of an erysipelatous inflammation. To this place a 2 per cent.
solution of carbolic acid was applied by means of a compress steeped in
the acid; the following morning the temperature rose from 36&middot;5&deg; (97&middot;7&deg;
F.) to 37&deg; (98&middot;6&deg; F.), and poisonous symptoms appeared. The urine was
coloured dark. There were sweats, vomitings, and contracted pupils,
spasmodic twitchings of the eyelids and eyes, with strabismus, slow
respiration, and, lastly, inability to swallow. Under the influence of
stimulating remedies the condition temporarily improved, but the child
died twenty-three and a half hours after the first application. An
examination showed that the vessels of the brain and the tissue of the
lungs were abnormally full of blood. The liver was softer than natural,
and exhibited a notable yellowishness in the centre of the acini. Somewhat
similar appearances were noticed in the kidneys, the microscopic
examination of which showed the <i>tubuli contorti</i> enlarged and filled with
fatty globules. In several places the epithelium was denuded, in other
places swollen, and with the nuclei very visible.</p>

<p>In an American case,<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> death followed the application of carbolic acid
to a wound. A boy had been bitten by a dog, and to the wound, at one
o&#8217;clock in the afternoon, a lotion, consisting of nine parts of carbolic acid
and one of glycerin, was applied. At seven o&#8217;clock in the evening the
child was unconscious, and died at one o&#8217;clock the following day.</p>

the system, not alone by the mouth, but by the lungs, as in breathing
carbolic acid spray or carbolic acid vapour. It is also absorbed by the
skin when outwardly applied, or in the dressing or the spraying of
wounds with carbolic acid. Lastly, the ordinary poisonous effects have
been produced by absorption from the bowel, when administered as an
enema. When swallowed undiluted, and in a concentrated form, the
symptoms may be those of early collapse, and speedy death. Hence,
the course is very similar to that witnessed in poisoning by the mineral
acids.</p>

<p>If lethal, but not excessive doses of the diluted acid are taken, the
symptoms are&mdash;a burning in the mouth and throat, a peculiarly unpleasant
persistent taste, and vomiting. There is faintness with pallor of the
face, which is covered by a clammy sweat, and the patient soon becomes
unconscious, the pulse small and thready, and the pupils sluggish to
light. The respiration is profoundly affected; there is dyspn&#339;a, and the
breathing becomes shallow. Death occurs from paralysis of the respiratory
apparatus, and the heart is observed to beat for a little after the
respiration has ceased. All these symptoms may occur from the application
of the acid to the skin or to mucous membranes, and have been
noticed when solutions of but moderate strength have been used&mdash;e.g.,
there are cases in gyn&aelig;cological practice in which the mucous membrane
(perhaps eroded) of the uterus has been irrigated with carbolic acid
injections. Thus, K&uuml;ster<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> relates a case in which, four days after confinement,
the uterus was washed out with a 2 per cent. solution of
carbolic acid without evil result. Afterwards a 5 per cent. solution was
used, but it at once caused violent symptoms of poisoning, the face
became livid, clonic convulsions came on, and at first loss of consciousness,
which after an hour returned. The patient died on the ninth day.
There was intense diphtheria of the uterus and vagina. Several other
similar cases (although not attended with such marked or fatal effects)
are on record.<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>It has been experimentally shown by K&uuml;ster, that previous loss of
blood, or the presence of septic fever, renders animals more sensitive to
carbolic acid. It is also said that children are more sensitive than adults.</p>

<p>The course of carbolic acid poisoning is very rapid. In 35 cases
collected by Falck, in which the period from the taking of the poison to
the moment of death was accurately noted, the course was as follows:&mdash;12
patients died within the first hour, and in the second hour 3; so that
within two hours 15 died. Between the third and the twelfth hour, 10
died; between the thirteenth and the twenty-fourth hour, 7 died; and
between the twenty-fifth and the sixtieth hour, only 3 died. Therefore,
slightly over 71 per cent. died within twelve hours, and 91&middot;4 per cent.
within the twenty-four hours.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_226" id="Sect_226"></a>&sect; 226. <b>Changes in the Urine.</b>&mdash;The urine of patients who have
absorbed in any way carbolic acid is dark in colour, and may smell
strongly of the acid. It is now established&mdash;chiefly by the experiments
and observations of Baumann<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>&mdash;that carbolic acid, when introduced into
the body, is mainly eliminated in the form of phenyl-sulphuric acid,
<span class="chemform">C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>HSO<sub>4</sub></span>, or more strictly speaking as potassic phenyl-sulphate,
<span class="chemform">C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>KSO<sub>4</sub></span>, a substance which is not precipitated by chloride of barium
until it has been decomposed by boiling with a mineral acid. Cresol is
similarly excreted as cresol-sulphuric acid, <span class="chemform">C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>HSO<sub>4</sub></span>, ortho-, meta-,
or para-, according to the kind of cresol injected; a portion may also
appear as hydro-tolu-chinone-sulphuric acid. Hence it is that, with doses
of phenol or cresol continually increasing, the amount of sulphates naturally
in the urine (as estimated by simply acidifying with hydrochloric
acid, and precipitating in the cold with chloride of barium) continually
decreases, and may at last vanish, for all the sulphuric acid present is
united with the phenol. On the other hand, the precipitate obtained by
prolonged boiling of the strongly acidified urine, after filtering off any
<span class="chemform">BaSO<sub>4</sub></span> thrown down in the cold, is ever increasing.</p>

(orthodihydroxyl phenol) are constant products of a
portion of the phenol. The hydroquinone appears in the urine, in the
first place, as the corresponding ether-sulphuric acid, which is colourless;
but a portion of it is set free, and this free hydroquinone (especially in
alkaline urine) is quickly oxidised to a brownish product, and hence the
peculiar colour of urine. Out of dark coloured carbolic acid urine the
hydroquinone and its products of decomposition can be obtained by shaking
with ether; on separation of the ether, an extract is obtained, reducing
alkaline silver solution, and developing quinone on warming with ferric
chloride.</p>

on animals have elucidated, in a great measure, the mode in
which carbolic acid acts, and the general sequence of effects, but there is
still much to be learnt.</p>

<p>E. K&uuml;ster<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> has shown that the temperature of dogs, when doses of
carbolic acid in solution are injected subcutaneously, or into the veins, is
immediately, or very soon after the operation, raised. With small and
moderate doses, this effect is but slight&mdash;from half to a whole degree&mdash;on
the day after the injection the temperature sinks below the normal
point, and only slowly becomes again natural. With doses that are just
lethal, first a rise and then a rapid sinking of temperature are observed;
but with those excessive doses which speedily kill, the temperature at
once sinks without a preliminary rise. The action on the heart is not
very marked, but there is always a slowing of the cardiac pulsations;
according to Hoppe-Seyler the arteries are relaxed. The respiration is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
much quickened; this acceleration is due to an excitement of the vagus
centre, since Salkowsky has shown that section of the vagus produces a
retardation of the respiratory wave. Direct application of the acid to
muscles or nerves quickly destroys their excitability without a previous
stage of excitement. The main cause of the lethal action of carbolic acid&mdash;putting
on one side those cases in which it may kill by its local corrosive
action&mdash;appears to be paralysis of the respiratory nervous centres.
The convulsions arise from the spinal cord. On the cessation of the
convulsions, the superficial nature of the breathing assists other changes
by preventing the due oxidation of the blood.</p>

as an oxidation product. According to the researches of Binnendijk,<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>
the separation of carbolic acid by the urine commences very quickly after
its ingestion; and, under favourable circumstances, it may be completely
excreted within from twelve to sixteen hours. It must be remembered
that normally a small amount of phenol may be present in the animal
body, as the result of the digestion of albuminous substances or of their
putrefaction. The amount excreted by healthy men when feeding on
mixed diet, Engel,<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> by experiment, estimates to be in the twenty-four

experiments on animals than the following:&mdash;That with lethal doses of
carbolic acid, administered by subcutaneous injection, or introduced by
the veins, no appearances may be found after death which can be called
at all characteristic. Further, in the cases in which death has occurred
from the outward application of the acid for the cure of scabies, &amp;c., no
lesion was ascertained after death which could&mdash;apart from the history
of the case and chemical evidence&mdash;with any confidence be ascribed to a
poison.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when somewhat large doses of the acid are taken
by the mouth, very coarse and appreciable changes are produced in the
upper portion of the alimentary tract. There may be brownish, wrinkled
spots on the cheek or lips; the mucous membrane of the mouth, throat,
and gullet is often white, and if the acid was concentrated, eroded. The
stomach is sometimes thickened, contracted, and blanched, a condition
well shown in a pathological preparation (ix. 206, 43 <i>f</i>) in St. George&#8217;s
Hospital. The mucous membrane, indeed, may be quite as much
destroyed as if a mineral acid had been taken. Thus, in Guy&#8217;s Hospital
museum (1799<sup>40</sup>), there is preserved the stomach of a child who died<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
from taking accidentally carbolic acid. It looks like a piece of paper,
and is very white, with fawn-coloured spots; the rug&aelig; are absent, and
the mucous membrane seems to have entirely vanished. Not unfrequently
the stomach exhibits white spots with roundish edges. The duodenum
is often affected, and the action is not always limited to the first part of
the intestine.</p>

<p>The respiratory passages are often inflamed, and the lungs infiltrated
and congested. As death takes place from an asphyxiated condition, the
veins of the head and brain, and the blood-vessels of the liver, kidney
and spleen, are gorged with blood, and the right side of the heart distended,
while the left is empty. On the other hand, a person may die
of sudden nervous shock from the ingestion of a large quantity of the
acid, and in such a case the <i>post-mortem</i> appearances will not then exhibit
precisely the characters just detailed. Putrefaction is retarded according
to the dose, and there is often a smell of carbolic acid.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> If any urine is

<h4>Tests for Carbolic Acid.</h4>

<p><a name="Sect_230" id="Sect_230"></a>&sect; 230. 1. <b>The Pinewood Test.</b>&mdash;Certain pinewood gives a beautiful
blue colour when moistened first with carbolic acid, and afterwards with
hydrochloric acid, and exposed to the light. Some species of pine give
a blue colour with hydrochloric acid alone, and such must not be used;
others do not respond to the test for carbolic acid. Hence it is necessary
to try the chips of wood first, to see how they act, and with this precaution
the test is very serviceable, and, in cautious hands, no error will
be made.</p>

<p>2. <b>Ammonia and Hypochlorite Test.</b>&mdash;If to a solution containing
even so small a quantity as 1 part of carbolic acid in 5000 parts of
water, first, about a quarter of its volume of ammonia hydrate be added,
and then a small quantity of sodic hypochlorite solution, avoiding excess,
a blue colour appears, warming quickens the reaction: the blue is permanent,
but turns to red with acids. If there is a smaller quantity than
the above proportion of acid, the reaction may be still produced feebly
after standing for some time.</p>

<p>3. <b>Ferric Chloride.</b>&mdash;One part of phenol in 3000 parts of water can
be detected by adding a solution of ferric chloride; a fine violet colour
is produced. This is also a very good test, when applied to a distillate;
but if applied to a complex liquid, the disturbing action of neutral salts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
and other substances may be too great to make the reaction under those
circumstances of service.</p>

<p>4. <b>Bromine.</b>&mdash;The most satisfactory test of all is treatment of the
liquid by bromine-water. A precipitate of tri-bromo-phenol (<span class="chemform">C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>3</sub>Br<sub>3</sub>O</span>)
is rapidly or slowly formed, according to the strength of the solution; in
detecting very minute quantities the precipitate must be given time to
form. According to Allen,<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> a solution containing but <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>60000</sub> of carbolic
acid gave the reaction after standing twenty-four hours.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>The properties of the precipitate are as follows:&mdash;It is crystalline, and
under the microscope is seen to consist of fine stars of needles; its smell
is peculiar; it is insoluble in water and acid liquids, but soluble in
alkalies, ether, and absolute alcohol; a very minute quantity of water
suffices to precipitate it from an alcoholic solution; it is therefore essential
to the success of the test that the watery liquid to be examined is
either neutral or acid in reaction.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_231" id="Sect_231"></a>&sect; 231. Tri-bromo-phenol may be used for the quantitative estimation
of carbolic acid, 100 parts of tri-bromo-phenol are equal to 29&middot;8 of carbolic
acid; by the action of sodium amalgam, tri-bromo-phenol is changed
back into carbolic acid.</p>

<p>That bromine-water precipitates several volatile and fixed alkaloids
from their solutions is no objection to the bromine test, for it may be
applied to a distillation product, the bases having been previously fixed
by sulphuric acid. Besides, the properties of tri-bromo-phenol are
distinct enough, and therefore there is no valid objection to the test. It
is the best hitherto discovered. There are also other reactions, such as that
Millon&#8217;s reagent strikes a red&mdash;molybdic acid, in concentrated sulphuric
acid, a blue&mdash;and potassic dichromate, with sulphuric acid, a brown colour&mdash;but
to these there are objections. Again, we have the <i>Euchlorine</i> test,
in which the procedure is as follows:&mdash;A test-tube is taken, and concentrated
hydrochloric acid is allowed to act therein upon potassic chlorate.
After the gas has been evolved for from 30 to 40 seconds, the liquid is
diluted with 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> volume of water, the gas removed by blowing through
a tube, and solution of strong ammonia poured in so as to form a
layer on the top; after blowing out the white fumes of ammonium
chloride, a few drops of the sample to be tested are added. In the
presence of carbolic acid, a rose-red, blood-red, or red-brown tint is
produced, according to the quantity present. Carbolic acid may be
confounded with <i>cresol</i> or with <i>creasote</i>, but the distinction between pure
carbolic acid, pure cresol, and creasote is plain.</p>

<p>Pure ortho-, meta-, or para-cresol have been obtained by synthetical
methods; they cannot be said to be in ordinary commerce.</p>

<p><b>Commercial cresol</b> is at ordinary temperatures a liquid, and cannot
be obtained in a crystalline state by freezing. Its boiling-point is from
198&deg; to 203&deg;; it is almost insoluble in strong ammonia, and, when 16
volumes are added, it then forms crystalline scales. On the other hand,
carbolic acid is soluble in an equal volume of ammonia, and is then
precipitated by the addition of 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> volume of water. Cresol is insoluble
in small quantities of pure 6 per cent. soda solution; with a large
excess, it forms crystalline scales; while carbolic acid is freely soluble in
small or large quantities of alkaline solutions.</p>

<p>Cold petroleum spirit dissolves cresol, but no crystalline scales can be
separated out by a freezing mixture. Carbolic acid, on the contrary, is
but sparingly soluble in cold petroleum, and a solution of carbolic acid
in hot petroleum, when exposed to sudden cold produced by a freezing
mixture, separates out crystals from the upper layer of liquid. Cresol is
miscible with glycerin of specific gravity 1&middot;258 in all proportions; 1 measure
of glycerin mixed with 1 measure of cresol is completely precipitated
by 1 measure of water. Carbolic acid, under the same circumstances,
is not precipitated. The density of cresol is about 1&middot;044. It forms with
bromine a tri-bromo-cresol, but this is liquid at ordinary temperatures,
while tri-bromo-phenol is solid. On the other hand, it resembles carbolic
acid in its reactions with ferric chloride and with nitric and sulphuric acid.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_233" id="Sect_233"></a>&sect; 233. <b>Creasote</b> or <b>Kreozote</b> is a term applied to the mixture of crude phenols
obtained from the distillation of wood-tar. It consists of a mixture of substances
of which the chief are guaiacol or oxycresol (<span class="chemform">C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>2</sub></span>), boiling at 200&deg;, and creasol
(<span class="chemform">C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>2</sub></span>), boiling at 217&deg;; also in small quantities phlorol (<span class="chemform">C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O</span>), methyl

Stockholm tar, and boils at about 217&deg;, consisting chiefly of creasol; it is not easy,
by mere chemical tests, to distinguish creasote from cresylic acid. Creasote, in its
reactions with sulphuric and nitric acid, bromine and gelatin, is similar to carbolic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"><span class="fsize110">[180]</span></a></span>
and cresylic acids, and its solubility in most solvents is also similar. It is, however,
distinguished from the tar acids by its insolubility in Price&#8217;s glycerin, specific
gravity 1&middot;258, whether 1, 2, or 3 volumes of glycerin be employed. But the best
test is its action on an ethereal solution of nitro-cellulose. Creasote mixes freely
with the B.P. collodium, while cresylic acid or carbolic acid at once coagulates
the latter. With complicated mixtures containing carbolic acid, cresol, and
creasote, the only method of applying these tests with advantage is to submit the
mixture to fractional distillation.</p>

<p>Fl&uuml;ckiger<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> tests for small quantities of carbolic acid in creasote, by mixing a
watery solution of the sample with one-fourth of its volume of ammonia hydrate,
wetting the inside of a porcelain dish with this solution, and then carefully
blowing bromine fumes on to the surface. A fine blue colour appears if carbolic
acid is present, but if the sample consists of creasote only, then it is dirty green
or brown. Excess of bromine spoils the reaction.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_214" id="Footnote_214"></a><a href="#FNanchor_214"><span class="label">[214]</span></a> Creasote is, without doubt, poisonous, though but little is known
of its action, and very few experiments are on record in which pure
creasote has been employed. Eulenberg has studied the symptoms in
rabbits, by submitting them to vaporised creasote&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the vapour
from 20 drops of creasote diffused through a glass shade under which a
rabbit was confined. There was at once great uneasiness, with a watery
discharge from the eyes, and after seven minutes the rabbit fell on its
side, and was slightly convulsed. The cornea was troubled, and the eyes
prominent; a white slime flowed from the mouth and eyes. After fifteen
minutes there was narcosis, with lessened reflex action; the temperature
was almost normal. There was rattling breathing, and in half an hour the
animal died, the respiration ceasing, and fluid blood escaping from the
nose. Section after death showed the brain to be hyper&aelig;mic, the mucous
membranes of the air-passages to be covered with a thin layer of fluid
blood, and the lungs to be congested; the right side of the heart was
gorged with fluid blood.</p>

<p>The <i>post-mortem</i> appearances and the symptoms generally are, therefore,
closely allied to those produced by carbolic acid. A dark colour of the
urine has also been noticed.</p>

the routine process given at <a href="#Page_51">page 51</a>, where the organic fluid is
distilled in a vacuum after acidifying with tartaric acid, is employed,
phenol or cresol, if present, will certainly be found in the distillate. If,
however, a special search be made for the acids, then the fluid must be
well acidified with sulphuric acid, and distilled in the usual way. The
distillation should be continued as long as possible, and the distillate
shaken up with ether in the apparatus figured at <a href="#Page_156">page 156</a>. On
separation and evaporation of the ether, the tar acids, if present, will
be left in a pure enough form to show its reactions. The same process
applies to the tissues, which, in a finely-divided state, are boiled and
distilled with dilute sulphuric acid, and the distillate treated as just
detailed.</p>

<p>Like most poisons, carbolic acid has a selective attraction for certain
organs, so that, unless all the organs are examined, it is by no means
indifferent which particular portion is selected for the inquiry. Hoppe-Seyler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
applied carbolic acid to the abdomen and thighs of dogs, and when
the symptoms were at their height bled them to death, and separately
examined the parts. In one case, the blood yielded &middot;00369 per cent.;
the brain, &middot;0034 per cent.; the liver, &middot;00125; and the kidneys, &middot;00423
per cent. of their weight of carbolic acid. The liver then contains only
one-third of the quantity found in an equal weight of blood, and, therefore,
the acid has no selective affinity for that organ. On the other
hand, the nervous tissue, and especially the kidneys, appear to concentrate
it.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_235" id="Sect_235"></a>&sect; 235. <b>Examination of the Urine for Phenol or Cresol.</b>&mdash;It has been
previously stated (see <a href="#Page_174">p. 174</a>) that the urine will not contain these as such,
but as compounds&mdash;viz., phenyl or cresyl sulphate of potassium. By
boiling with a mineral acid, these compounds may be broken up, and the
acids obtained, either by distillation or by extraction with ether. To detect
very minute quantities, a large quantity of the urine should be evaporated
down to a syrup, and treated with hydrochloric acid and ether.
On evaporating off the ether, the residue should be distilled with dilute
sulphuric acid, and this distillate then tested with bromine-water, and
the tri-bromo-phenol or cresol collected, identified, and weighed.</p>

<p>The urine was evaporated to a syrup, extracted with alcohol of 90 per
cent., treated with an alcoholic solution of oxalic acid as long as this
produced a precipitate, and then shaken with an equal volume of ether.
The mixture was next filtered, neutralised with potassic carbonate,
evaporated to a small bulk, and again taken up with alcohol. Some
oxalate and carbonate of potassium were separated, and, on evaporation
to a syrup, crystals of potassic phenyl-sulphate were obtained. They

or cresol-sulphate in the urine, the normal sulphates may be
separated by the addition of chloride of barium in the cold, first acidifying
with hydrochloric acid. On boiling the liquid a second crop of

latter, as measured in a graduated tube, have been collected, the receiver is changed.
The volume of water is read off. If the oily liquid floats on the water, it contains
light oil of tar; if it is heavier than the water, it is regarded as hydrated acid, containing
50 per cent. of real carbolic acid. The next portion consists of anhydrous
cresylic and carbolic acids, and 625 volumes are distilled over; the remainder in the
retort consists wholly of cresylic acid and the higher homologues. The relative proportions
of carbolic and cresylic acids are approximately determined by taking the
solidifying point, which should be between 15&middot;5&deg; and 24&deg;, and having ascertained
this temperature, imitating it by making mixtures of known proportions of carbolic

<p>1. A solution containing 10 grms. of pure carbolic acid to the litre; this serves as
a standard solution.</p>

<p>2. A solution of bromine in water.</p>

<p>3. Solution of alum in dilute sulphuric acid. A litre of 10 per cent. sulphuric
acid is shaken with alum crystals until saturated.</p>

<p>The actual process is as follows:&mdash;10 grms. of the sample are weighed out and
run into a litre flask, water added, and the mixture shaken. The flask being finally
filled up to the neck, some of the solution is now filtered through a dry filter, and
10 c.c. of this filtrate is placed in a 6 or 8-ounce stoppered bottle, and 30 c.c. of the
alum solution added. In a similar bottle 10 c.c. of the standard solution of carbolic
acid are placed, and a similar quantity of alum solution is added, as in the first
bottle. The bromine-water is now run into the bottle containing the standard solution
of carbolic acid from a burette until there is no further precipitate; the bottle
is stoppered and shaken after every addition. Towards the end of the reaction the
precipitate forms but slowly, and when the carbolic acid is saturated, the slight
excess of bromine-water gives the solution a pale yellow tint. The solution from the
sample is treated in the same way, and from the amount of bromine-water used, the
percentage of the sample is obtained by making the usual calculations. Thus, supposing
that 5 c.c. of the standard required 15 c.c. of the bromine-water for precipitation,
and 10 c.c. of the solution of the sample required 17 c.c., the calculation would
be 15&nbsp;&times; 2&nbsp;:&nbsp;17 = 100&nbsp;:&nbsp;<i>x</i> per cent. With most samples of crude carbolic acid, the precipitate
does not readily separate. It is then best to add a little of the precipitate
already obtained by testing the standard solution, which rapidly clears the liquid.</p>

<p><b>Koppeschaar&#8217;s volumetric method</b> is more exact, but also more elaborate, than
the one just described. Caustic normal soda is treated with bromine until permanently
yellow, and the excess of bromine is then driven off by boiling. The
liquid now contains <span class="chemform">5NaBr</span> + <span class="chemform">NaBrO<sub>3</sub></span>, and on adding this to a solution containing
carbolic acid, and a sufficient quantity of hydrochloric acid to combine with the
sodium, the following reactions occur:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="chemreact">(1.) 5NaBr + NaBrO<sub>3</sub> + 6HCl = 6NaCl + 6Br + 3H<sub>2</sub>O;</p>

<p>and</p>

<p class="chemreact">(2.) C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O + 6Br = C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>3</sub>Br<sub>3</sub>O + 3HBr.</p>

<p>Any excess of bromine liberated in the first reaction above that necessary for the
second, will exist in the free state, and from the amount of bromine which remains
free the quantity of carbolic acid can be calculated, always provided the strength of
the bromine solution is first known. The volumetric part of the analysis, therefore,
merely amounts to the determination of free bromine, which is best found by causing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"><span class="fsize110">[183]</span></a></span>
it to react on potassium iodide, and ascertaining the amount of free iodine by titration
with a standard solution of sodium thiosulphate. In other words, titrate in
this way the standard alkaline bromine solution, using as an indicator starch paste
until the blue colour disappears. Another method of indicating the end of the
reaction is by the use of strips of paper first soaked in starch solution, and dried,
and then the same papers moistened with zinc iodide, and again dried; the least
excess of bromine sets free iodine, and strikes a blue colour.</p>

<p><b>Colorimetric Method of Estimation.</b>&mdash;A very simple and ever-ready way of
approximately estimating minute quantities of the phenols consists in shaking up
10 grms. of the sample with water, allowing any tar or insoluble impurities to subside.
Ten c.c. of the clear fluid are then taken, and half a c.c. of a 5 per cent.
solution of ferric chloride added. The colour produced is imitated by a standard
solution of carbolic acid, and a similar amount of the reagent, on the usual principles
of colorimetric analysis.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_237" id="Sect_237"></a>&sect; 237. <b>Carbolic Acid Powders.</b>&mdash;Siliceous carbolic acid powders are placed in a
retort and distilled. Towards the end the heat may be raised to approaching redness.
The distillate separates into two portions&mdash;the one aqueous, the other consisting
of the acids&mdash;and the volume may be read off, if the distillate be received in
a graduated receiver. Carbolic acid powders, having lime as a basis, may be distilled
in the same way, after first decomposing with sulphuric acid. The estimation
of the neutral tar oils in the distillate is easily performed by shaking the distillate
with caustic soda solution, which dissolves completely the tar acids. The volume of
the oils may be directly read off if the receiver is a graduated tube. Allen<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> has
suggested the addition of a known volume of petroleum to the distillate, which dissolves
the tar oils, and easily separates, and thus the volume may be more accurately
determined, a correction being of course made by subtracting the volume of petroleum
first added.</p>

<h3>X.&mdash;Nitro-Benzene.</h3>

<p><a name="Sect_239" id="Sect_239"></a>&sect; 239.&mdash;Nitro-benzene is the product resulting from the action of strong
nitric acid on benzene. Its chemical formula is <span class="chemform">C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NO<sub>2</sub></span>. When pure,
it is of a pale yellow colour, of a density of 1&middot;186, and boils at from 205&deg;

of 3&deg;. Its smell is exactly the same as that from the oil or
essence of bitter almonds; and it is from this circumstance, under the
name of &#8220;essence of mirbane,&#8221; much used in the preparation of perfumes
and flavouring agents.</p>

<p>In commerce there are three kinds of nitro-benzene&mdash;the purest, with

specially used for the preparation of aniline, or aniline blue. Nitro-benzene
has been used as an adulterant of bitter almond oil, but
the detection is easy (see &#8220;Foods,&#8221; p. 551). Nitro-benzene was
first discovered by Mitscherlich in 1834, and its poisonous properties
were first pointed out by Casper<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> in 1859. Its technical use in
perfumes, &amp;c., dates from about 1848, and in the twenty-eight years
intervening between that date and 1876, J&uuml;bell<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> has collected 42 cases

very powerful poison, whether taken in the form of vapour or as a liquid.
The action of the vapour on animals has been studied by Eulenberg<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>
and others. One experiment will serve as an illustration. Fifteen
grms. of nitro-benzene were evaporated on warm sand under a glass
shade, into which a cat was introduced. There was immediately observed
in the animal much salivation, and quickened and laboured breathing.
After thirty minutes&#8217; exposure, on removing the shade to repeat the
dose of 15 grms., the cat for the moment escaped. On being put
back there was again noticed the salivation and running at the eyes, with
giddiness, and repeated rising and falling. The animal at last, about one
hour and forty minutes after the first dose, succumbed with dyspn&#339;a, and
died with progressive paralysis of the respiration. The membranes of
the brain were found gorged with blood, the lungs liver-coloured, the
mucous membrane of the trachea&mdash;to the finest sub-divisions of the
bronchia&mdash;reddened, inflamed, and clothed with a fine frothy mucus.
The left side of the heart was filled with thick black blood. The bladder
contained 8 grms. of clear urine, in which aniline was discovered. There
was a notable smell of bitter almonds.</p>

their details to those just described. In a remarkable case related by
Dr. Letheby, a man, aged 42, had spilt some nitro-benzene over his
clothes. He went about several hours breathing an atmosphere of nitro-benzene,
he then became drowsy, his expression was stupid, and his gait
unsteady, presenting all the appearances of intoxication. The stupor
suddenly deepened into coma, and the man died; the fatal course being
altogether about nine hours&mdash;viz., four hours before coma, and five hours of
total insensibility.</p>

<p>An interesting case of poisoning by the vapour is recorded by Taylor.<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
A woman, aged 30, tasted a liquid used for flavouring pastry, which was
afterwards chemically identified as pure nitro-benzene. She immediately
spat it out, finding that it had an acrid taste, and probably did not
swallow more than a drop. In replacing the bottle, however, she spilt
about a tablespoonful, and allowed it to remain for some minutes; it was
a small room, and the vapour rapidly pervaded it, and caused illness in
herself as well as in a fellow-servant. She had a strange feeling of
numbness in the tongue, and in three hours and a quarter after the
accident was seen by a medical man; she then presented all the appearances
of prussic acid poisoning. The eyes were bright and glassy, the
features pale and ghastly, the lips and nails purple, as if stained with
blackberries, the skin clammy, and the pulse feeble, but the mind was
then clear. An emetic was administered, but she suddenly became
unconscious; the emetic acted, and brought up a fluid with an odour of
nitro-benzene. The stomach-pump was also used, but the liquid obtained
had scarcely any odour of nitro-benzene. In about eleven hours consciousness
returned, and in about seventeen hours she partially recovered, but
complained of flashes of light and strange colours before her eyes.
Recovery was not complete for weeks. In this case the small quantity
swallowed would probably of itself have produced no symptoms, and the
effects are to be mainly ascribed to the breathing of the vapour.</p>

way as the vapour, and the symptoms resemble very much those produced
by prussic acid. The great distinction between prussic acid and nitro-benzene
poisoning is that, in the latter, there is an interval between the
taking of the poison and its effects. This is, indeed, one of the strangest
phenomena of nitro-benzene poisoning, for the person, after taking it,
may appear perfectly well for periods varying from a quarter of an hour
to two or three hours, or even longer, and then there may be most alarming
symptoms, followed by rapid death. Poisoning by nitro-benzene satisfies
the ideal of the dramatist, who requires, for the purposes of his plot,
poisons not acting at once, but with an interval sufficiently prolonged to
admit of lengthy rhapsodies and a complicated <i>d&eacute;nouement</i>. On drinking
the poison there is a burning taste in the mouth, shortly followed by a
very striking blueness or purple appearance of the lips, tongue, skin,
nails, and even the conjunctiv&aelig;. This curious colour of the skin has, in
one or two instances, been witnessed an hour before any feeling of illness
manifested itself; vomiting then comes on, the vomited matter smelling
of nitro-benzene. The skin is cold, there is great depression, and the
pulse is small and weak. The respiration is affected, the breathing being
slow and irregular, the breath smelling strongly of the liquid, and the
odour often persisting for days. A further stage is that of loss of consciousness,
and this comes on with all the suddenness of a fit of apoplexy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
The coma is also similar in appearance to apoplectic coma,
but there have frequently been seen trismus and convulsions of the
extremities. The pupils are dilated and do not react to light, and reflex
sensibility is sometimes completely extinguished. Cases vary a little in
their main features; in a few the blue skin and the deep sleep are the
only symptoms noted. Death, for the most part, occurs after a period of
from eight to twenty-four hours (occasionally as soon as four or five
hours) after taking the poison.</p>

<p>From the following remarkable train of symptoms in a dog, it is
probable, indeed, that nitro-benzene, taken by a human being, might
produce death, after a rather prolonged period of time, by its secondary
effects:&mdash;To a half-bred greyhound<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> were administered 15 grms. of nitro-benzene,
when shortly after there were noticed much salivation, shivering,
and muscular twitchings. The same dose was repeated at the end of
five, of seven, and of eight hours respectively, so that the dog altogether
took 60 grms., but with no other apparent symptom than the profuse salivation.
On the following day, the dog voided a tapeworm; vomiting
supervened; the heart&#8217;s action was quickened, and the breathing
difficult; convulsions followed, and the pupils were seen to be dilated.
For eight days the dog suffered from dyspn&#339;a, quickened pulse, shivering
of the legs or of the whole body, tetanic spasms, bloody motions, great
thirst and debility. The temperature gradually sank under 25&deg;, and the
animal finally died. The autopsy showed, as the most striking change,
the whole mucous membrane of the intestinal tract covered with a yellow
layer, which chemical analysis proved to be caused by picric acid, and in
the urine, liver, and lungs, aniline was discovered.</p>

(15&middot;4 grains) would be quite sufficient to kill an adult, and, under
favourable circumstances, less than that quantity. It would seem that
spirituous liquids especially hasten and intensify the action of nitro-benzene,
so that a drunken person, <i>c&aelig;teris paribus</i>, taking the poison
with spirits, would be more affected than taking it under other conditions.</p>

<p>In a case related by Stevenson,<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> in which so small a quantity as 1&middot;74<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
grm. was taken in seven doses, spread over more than forty-eight hours;
there were yet extremely alarming symptoms, and the patient seems to
have had a narrow escape. On the other hand, a woman admitted into the
General Hospital, Vienna, took 100 grms. (about 3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> ozs.) and recovered;
on admission she was in a highly cyanotic condition, with small pulse,
superficial respiration, and dribbling of urine, which contained nitro-benzol.
Artificial respiration was practised, and camphor injections were
administered. Under this treatment consciousness was restored, and the
patient recovered. On the fourth day the urine resembled that of a case
of cystitis (<i>Lancet</i>, Jan. 16, 1894). The quantity of nitro-benzene which
would be fatal, if breathed, is not known with any accuracy.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_244" id="Sect_244"></a>&sect; 244. <b>Pathological Appearances.</b>&mdash;The more characteristic appearances
seem to be, a dark brown or even black colour of the blood, which
coagulates with difficulty (an appearance of the blood that has even been
noticed during life), venous hyper&aelig;mia of the brain and its membranes,
and general venous engorgement. In the stomach, when the fluid has
been swallowed, the mucous membrane is sometimes reddened diffusely,
and occasionally shows ecchymoses of a punctiform character.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_245" id="Sect_245"></a>&sect; 245. <b>The essential action of nitro-benzene</b> is of considerable
physiological interest. The blood is certainly in some way changed, and
gives the spectrum of acid h&aelig;matin.<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> Filehne has found that the blood
loses, in a great degree, the power of carrying and imparting oxygen to
the tissues, and its content of carbon dioxide is also increased. Thus,
the normal amount of oxygen gas which the arterial blood of a hound
will give up is 17 per cent.; but in the case of a dog which had been
poisoned with nitro-benzene, it sank to 1 per cent. During the dyspn&#339;a
from which the dog suffered, the carbon dioxide exhaled was greater
than the normal amount, and the arterial blood (the natural content of
which should have been 30 per cent. of this gas), only gave up 9 per
cent. Filehne seeks to explain the peculiar colour of the skin by the
condition of the blood, but the explanation is not altogether satisfactory.
Some part of the nitro-benzene, without doubt, is reduced to aniline in
the body&mdash;an assertion often made, and as often contradicted&mdash;but it has
been found in too many cases to admit of question. It would also seem
from the experiment on the dog (<a href="#Page_186">p. 186</a>), that a conversion into picric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>

<p><a name="Sect_246" id="Sect_246"></a>&sect; 246. <b>Detection and Separation of Nitro-Benzene from the
Animal Tissues.</b>&mdash;It is evident from the changes which nitro-benzene
may undergo that the expert, in any case of suspected nitro-benzene
poisoning, must specially look (1) for nitro-benzene, (2) for aniline, and
(3) for picric acid. The best general method for the separation of nitro-benzene
is to shake up the liquid (or finely-divided solid) with light
benzoline (petroleum ether), which readily dissolves nitro-benzene. On
evaporation of the petroleum ether, the nitro-benzene is left, perhaps mixed
with fatty matters. On treating with cold water, the fats rise to the
surface, and the nitro-benzene sinks to the bottom; so that, by means of
a separating funnel, the nitro-benzene may be easily removed from animal
fats. The oily drops, or fine precipitate believed to be nitro-benzene,
may be dissolved in spirit and reduced to aniline by the use of nascent
hydrogen, developed from iron filings by hydrochloric acid, and the fluid
tested with bleaching powder, or, the aniline itself may be recovered by
alkalising the fluid, and shaking up with ether in the separation-tube
(<a href="#Page_156">p. 156</a>), the ether dissolves the aniline, and leaves it, on spontaneous
evaporation, as an oily yellowish mass, which, on the addition of a few
drops of sodic hypochlorite, strikes a blue or violet-blue&mdash;with acids, a rose-red&mdash;and
with bromine, a flesh-red. It gives alkaloidal reactions with
such general reagents as platinum chloride, picric acid, &amp;c. Aniline itself
may be extracted from the tissues and fluids of the body by petroleum
ether, but in any special search it will be better to treat the organs as in
Stas&#8217; process&mdash;that is, with strong alcohol, acidified with sulphuric acid.
After a suitable digestion in this menstruum, filter, and then, after evaporating
the alcohol, dissolve the alcoholic extract in water; alkalise the
aqueous solution, and extract the aniline by shaking it up with light
benzoline. On separating the benzoline, the aniline will be left, and may
be dissolved in feebly-acid water, and the tests before enumerated tried.</p>

<p>Malpurgo<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> recommends the following test for nitro-benzene:&mdash;2 drops
of melted phenol, 3 drops of water, and a fragment of caustic potash are
boiled in a small porcelain dish, and to the boiling liquid the aqueous
solution to be tested is added. On prolonged boiling, if nitro-benzene is
present, a crimson ring is produced at the edges of the liquid; this crimson
colour, on the addition of a little bleaching powder, turns emerald-green.</p>

<p>Oil of bitter almonds may be distinguished from nitro-benzene by

<h3>XI.&mdash;Dinitro-benzol.</h3>

<p><a name="Sect_247" id="Sect_247"></a>&sect; 247. <b>Dinitro-benzol</b>, <span class="chemform">C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(NO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub></span> (ortho-, meta-, para-).&mdash;The ortho-compound
is produced by the action of nitric acid on benzol, aided by
heat in the absence of strong sulphuric acid to fix water. Some of the
para-dinitro-benzol is at the same time produced. The meta-compound
is obtained by the action of fuming nitric acid on nitro-benzol at a boiling
temperature.</p>

<p>The physical properties of the three dinitro-benzols are briefly as
follows:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Ortho-d. is in the form of needles; m.p. 118&deg;.</p>

<p>Meta-d. crystallises in plates; m.p. 90&deg;.</p>

<p>Para-d. crystallises, like the ortho-compound, in needles, but the
melting-point is much higher, 171&deg; to 172&deg;.</p>

<p>Just as nitro-benzol by reduction yields aniline, so do the nitro-benzols
on reduction yield ortho-, meta-, or para-phenylene diamines.</p>

<p>Meta-phenylene diamine is an excellent test for nitrites; and, since
the commercial varieties of dinitro-benzol either consist mainly or in part
of meta-dinitro-benzol, the toxicological detection is fairly simple, and is
based upon the conversion of the dinitro-benzol into meta-phenylene-diamine.</p>

<p>Dinitro-benzol is at present largely employed in the manufacture of
explosives, such as roburite, sicherheit, and others. It has produced
much illness among the workpeople in the manufactures, and amongst
miners whose duty it has been to handle such explosives.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_248" id="Sect_248"></a>&sect; 248. <b>Effects of Dinitro-benzol.</b>&mdash;Huber<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> finds that if dinitro-benzol
is given to frogs by the mouth in doses of from 100 to 200 mgrms.,
death takes place in a few hours. Doses of from 2&middot;5 to 5 mgrms. cause
general dulness and ultimately complete paralysis, and death in from one
to six days.</p>

<p>Rabbits are killed by doses of 400 mgrms., in time varying from
twenty-two hours to four days.</p>

<p>In a single experiment on a small dog, the weight of which was
5525 grms., the dog died in six hours after a dose of 600 mgrms.</p>

<p>It is therefore probable that a dose of 100 mgrms. per kilo would kill
most warm-blooded animals.</p>

<p>A transient exposure to dinitro-benzol vapours in man causes serious
symptoms; for instance, in one of Huber&#8217;s cases, a student of chemistry
had been engaged for one hour and a half only in preparing dinitro-benzol,
and soon afterwards his comrades remarked that his face was of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
deep blue colour. On admission to hospital, on the evening of the same
day, he complained of slight headache and sleeplessness; both cheeks,
the lips, the muscles of the ear, the mucous membrane of the lips and
cheeks, and even the tongue, were all of a more or less intense blue-grey
colour. The pulse was dicrotic, 124; T. 37&middot;2&deg;. The next morning the
pulse was slower, and by the third day the patient had recovered.</p>

<p>Excellent accounts of the effects of dinitro-benzol in roburite factories
have been published by Dr. Ross<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> and Professor White,<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> of Wigan.
Mr. Simeon Snell<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> has also published some most interesting cases of
illness, cases which have been as completely investigated as possible.

<p>C. F. W., aged 38, consulted Mr. Snell for his defective sight on
April 9, 1892. He had been a mixer at a factory for the manufacture
of explosives. He was jaundiced, the conjunctiva yellow, and the lips
blue. He was short of breath, and after the day&#8217;s work experienced
aching of the forearms and legs and tingling of the fingers. The urine
was black in colour, of sp. gr. 1024; it was examined spectroscopically
by Mr. MacMunn, who reported the black colour as due neither to
indican, nor to blood, nor bile, but to be caused by some pigment belonging
to the aromatic series. The patient&#8217;s sight had been failing since the
previous Christmas. Vision in the right eye was <sup>6</sup>&#8260;<sub>24</sub>, left <sup>6</sup>&#8260;<sub>36</sub>, both optic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
papill&aelig; were somewhat pale. In each eye there was a central scotoma
for red, and contraction of the field (see <a href="#Fig_225">diagram</a>). The man gradually
gave up the work, and ultimately seems to have recovered. It is, however,
interesting to note that, after having left the work for some weeks,
he went back for a single day to the &#8220;mixing,&#8221; and was taken very ill,
being insensible and delirious for five hours.</p>

by dinitro-benzol is of a dark chocolate colour, and the microscope shows
destruction of the red corpuscles; the amount of destruction may be
gathered from the following:&mdash;the blood corpuscles of a rabbit before
the experiment numbered 5,588,000 per cubic centimetre; a day after
the experiment 4,856,000; a day later 1,004,000; on the third day the
rabbit died.</p>

<p>Dr. MacMunn<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> has examined specimens of blood from two of Mr.

corpuscles were smaller than usual, about 5 or 6 &micro; in diameter, and the
appearances were like those seen in pernicious an&aelig;mia. Huber, in some
of his experiments on animals, found a spectroscopic change in the blood,
viz., certain absorption bands, one in the red between C and D, and two
in the green between D and E; the action of reducing agents on this

<p>Taking the symptoms as a whole, there has been noted:&mdash;a blue
colour of the lips, not unfrequently extending over the whole face, and
even the conjunctiv&aelig; have been of a marked blue colour, giving the
sufferer a strange livid appearance. In other cases there have been
jaundice, the conjunctiv&aelig; and the skin generally being yellow, the lips
blue. Occasionally gastric symptoms are present. Sleeplessness is common,
and not unfrequently there is some want of muscular co-ordination,
and the man staggers as if drunk. In more than one case there has been
noticed sudden delirium. There is in chronic cases always more or less
an&aelig;mia, and the urine is remarkable in its colour, which ranges from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
slightly dark hue up to positive blackness. In a large proportion of cases
there is ophthalmic trouble, the characteristics of which (according to Mr.
Snell) are &#8220;failure of sight, often to a considerable degree, in a more or
less equal extent on the two sides; concentric attraction of visual field
with, in many cases, a central colour scotoma; enlargement of retinal
vessels, especially the veins; some blurring, never extensive, of edges of
disc, and a varying degree of pallor of its surface&mdash;the condition of retinal
vessels spoken of being observed in workers with the dinitro-benzol,
independently of complaints of defective sight. Cessation of work leads
to recovery.&#8221;</p>

the fluid alkaline by caustic soda, and extract with ether in a separating
tube; any metaphenylene-diamine will be contained in the ether;
remove the ether into a flask, and distil it off; dissolve the residue in a
little water.</p>

<p>Acidify a solution of sodium nitrite with dilute sulphuric acid; on
adding the solution, if it contains metaphenylene-diamine, a yellow to
red colour will be produced, from the formation of Bismarck brown

0&middot;7058 at 18&deg; C., boiling-point 26&middot;5&deg; (80&deg; F.), HCy = 27.&mdash;The anhydrous
acid is not an article of commerce, and is only met with in the
laboratory. It is a colourless, transparent liquid, and so extremely volatile
that, if a drop fall on a glass plate, a portion of it freezes. It has a
very peculiar peach-blossom odour, and is intensely poisonous. It
reddens litmus freely and transiently, dissolves red oxide of mercury
freely, forms a white precipitate of argentic cyanide when treated with
silver nitrate, and responds to the other tests described hereafter.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_252" id="Sect_252"></a>&sect; 252. <b>Medicinal Preparations of Prussic Acid.</b>&mdash;The B.P. acid is
a watery solution of prussic acid; its specific gravity should be 0&middot;997, and
it should contain 2 per cent. of the anhydrous acid, 2 per cent. is also the
amount specified in the pharmacop&#339;ias of Switzerland and Norway, and
in that of Borussica (VI. ed.); the latter ordains, however, a spirituous
solution, and the Norwegian an addition of 1 per cent. of concentrated
sulphuric acid. The French prussic acid is ordered to be prepared of a
strength equalling 10 per cent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>The adulterations or impurities of prussic acid are hydrochloric, sulphuric,<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>
and formic acids. Traces of silver may be found in the French
acid, which is prepared from cyanide of silver. Tartaric acid is also
occasionally present. Hydrochloric acid is most readily detected by
neutralising with ammonia, and evaporating to dryness in a water-bath;
the ammonium cyanide decomposes and volatilises, leaving as a saline
residue chloride of ammonium. This may easily be identified by the
precipitate of chloride of silver, which its solution gives on testing with
silver nitrate, and the deep brown precipitate with Nessler solution.
Sulphuric acid is, of course, detected by chloride of barium; formic acid
by boiling a small quantity with a little mercuric oxide; if present, the
oxide will be reduced, and metallic mercury fall as a grey precipitate.
Silver, tartaric acid, and any other fixed impurities are detected by
evaporating the acid to dryness, and examining any residue which may
be left. It may be well to give the various strengths of the acids of
commerce in a tabular form:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In English commerce, the analyst will scarcely meet with any acid

<p>Impure oil of bitter almonds contains hydric cyanide in variable

preparation obtained by digesting cherry-laurel leaves in water, and then
distilling a certain portion over. This <i>Aqua Lauro-cerasi</i> belongs to the
old school of pharmacy, and is of uncertain strength, but varies from &middot;7

<p>Greshoff<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> has discovered an amygdalin-like glucoside in the two tropical
trees <i>Pygeum parriflorum</i> and <i>P. latifolium</i>. The same author states
that the leaves of <i>Gymnema latifolium</i>, one of the Asclepiads, yields to
distillation benzaldehyde hydrocyanide. Both <i>Lasia</i> and <i>Cyrtosperma</i>,
plants belonging to the natural family of the Orontads, contain in their
flowers potassic cyanide. <i>Pangium edule</i>, according to Greshoff, contains
so much potassic cyanide that he was able to prepare a considerable
quantity of that salt from one sample of the plant. An Indian plant
(<i>Hydnocarpus inebrians</i>) also contains a cyanide, and has been used for
the purpose of destroying fish. Among the Tiliads, Greshoff found that
<i>Echinocarpus Sigun</i> yielded hydrocyanic acid on distillation. Even the
common linseed contains a glucoside which breaks up into sugar, prussic
acid, and a ketone.</p>

<p>To these figures must be added 10 cases of murder (2 males and 8
females) by prussic acid, and 4 cases of murder (3 males and 1 female)
by potassic cyanide.</p>

<p>In order to ascertain the proportion in which the various forms of
commercial cyanides cause death, and also the proportion of accidental,
suicidal, and criminal deaths from the same cause, Falck collated twelve
years of statistics from medical literature with the following result:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In 51 cases of cyanide poisoning, 29 were caused by potassic cyanide,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
9 by hydric cyanide, 5 by oil of bitter almonds, 3 by peach stones (these
3 were children, and are classed as &#8220;domestic,&#8221; that is, taking the kernels
as a food), 3 by bitter almonds (1 of the 3 suicidal and followed by death,
the other 2 &#8220;domestic&#8221;), 1 by tartaric acid and potassic cyanide (a
suicidal case, an apothecary), and 1 by ferro-cyanide of potassium and
tartaric acid. Of the 43 cases first mentioned, 21 were suicidal, 7
criminal, 8 domestic, and 7 medicinal; the 43 patients were 24 men, 14
children, and 5 women.</p>

<p>The cyanides are very rarely used for the purpose of murder: a poison
which has a strong smell and a perceptible taste, and which also kills
with a rapidity only equalled by deadly bullet or knife-wounds, betrays
its presence with too many circumstances of a tragic character to find
favour in the dark and secret schemes of those who desire to take life by
poison. In 793 poisoning cases of a criminal character in France, 4 only
were by the cyanides.</p>

<p>Hydric and potassic cyanides were once the favourite means of self-destruction
employed by suicidal photographers, chemists, scientific
medical men, and others in positions where such means are always at
hand; but, of late years, the popular knowledge of poisons has increased,
and self-poisoning by the cyanides scarcely belongs to a particular class.
A fair proportion of the deaths are also due to accident or unfortunate
mistakes, and a still smaller number to the immoderate or improper use
of cyanide-containing vegetable products.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_256" id="Sect_256"></a>&sect; 256. <b>Accidental and Criminal Poisoning by Prussic Acid.</b>&mdash;The
poison is almost always taken by the mouth into the stomach, but occasionally
in other ways&mdash;such, for example, as in the case of the illustrious
chemist, Scheele, who died from inhalation of the vapour of the acid
which he himself discovered, owing to the breaking of a flask. There is
also the case related by Tardieu, in which cyanide of potassium was introduced
under the nails; and that mentioned by Carri&egrave;re,<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> in which a
woman gave herself, with suicidal intent, an enema containing cyanide

life in a few minutes.<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p><a name="Sect_257" id="Sect_257"></a>&sect; 257. <b>Fatal Dose.</b>&mdash;Notwithstanding the great number of persons
who in every civilised country fall victims to the cyanides, it is yet
somewhat doubtful what is the minimum dose likely to kill an adult
healthy man. The explanation of this uncertainty is to be sought mainly
in the varying strength of commercial prussic acid, which varies from 1&middot;5
(Schraeder&#8217;s) to 50 per cent. (Robiquet&#8217;s), and also in the varying condition
of the person taking the poison, more especially whether the stomach be
full or empty. In by far the greater number, the dose taken has been
much beyond that necessary to produce death, but this observation is
true of most poisonings.</p>

<p>The dictum of Taylor, that a quantity of commercial prussic acid,
equivalent to 1 English grain (65 mgrm.) of the anhydrous acid, would,
under ordinary circumstances, be sufficient to destroy adult life, has
been generally accepted by all toxicologists. The minimum lethal dose
of potassic cyanide is similarly put at 2&middot;41 grains (&middot;157 grm.). As
to bitter almonds, if it be considered that as a mean they contain
2&middot;5 per cent. of amygdalin, then it would take 45 grms., or about 80

fact, 4 to 6 bitter almonds are said to have produced poisoning in a child.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_258" id="Sect_258"></a>&sect; 258. <b>Action of Hydric and Potassic Cyanides on Living Organisms.</b>&mdash;Both
hydric cyanide and potassic cyanide are poisonous to all living
forms, vegetable or animal, with the exception of certain fungi. The
cold-blooded animals take a larger relative dose than the warm-blooded,
and the mammalia are somewhat more sensitive to the
poisonous action of the cyanides than birds; but all are destroyed in a
very similar manner, and without any essential difference of action. The
symptoms produced by hydric and potassic cyanide are identical, and, as
regards general symptoms, what is true as to the one is also true as to the
other. There is, however, one important difference in the action of
these two substances, if the mere local action is considered, for potassic
cyanide is very alkaline, possessing even caustic properties. I have seen,
<i>e.g.</i>, the gastric mucous membrane of a woman, who had taken an excessive
dose of potassic cyanide on an empty stomach, so inflamed and swollen,
that its state was similar to that induced by a moderate quantity of solution
of potash. On the other hand, the acid properties of hydric cyanide
are very feeble, and its effect on mucous membranes or the skin in no
way resembles that of the mineral acids.</p>

<p>It attacks the animal system in two ways: the one, a profound interference
with the ordinary metabolic changes; the other, a paralysis of
the nervous centres. Sch&ouml;nbein discovered that it affected the blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
corpuscles in a peculiar way; normal blood decomposes with great ease
hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water. If to normal venous blood a
little peroxide of hydrogen be added, the blood at once becomes bright
red; but if a trace of prussic acid be present, it is of a dark brown
colour. The blood corpuscles, therefore, lose their power of conveying
oxygen to all parts of the system, and the phenomena of asphyxia are
produced. Geppert<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> has proved that this is really the case by showing,
in a series of researches, that, under the action of hydric cyanide, less
oxygen is taken up, and less carbon dioxide formed than normal, even if
the percentage of oxygen in the atmosphere breathed is artificially
increased. The deficiency of oxygen is in part due to the fact that substances
like lactic acid, the products of incomplete combustion, are
formed instead of <span class="chemform">CO<sub>2</sub></span>.</p>

<p>At the same time the protoplasm of the tissues is paralysed, and
unable to take up the loosely bound oxygen presented. This explains a
striking symptom which has been noticed by many observers, that is, if
hydrocyanic acid be injected into an animal, the venous blood becomes
of a bright red colour; in warm-blooded animals this bright colour is
transitory, but in cold-blooded animals, in which the oxidation process is
slower, the blood remains bright red.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_259" id="Sect_259"></a>&sect; 259. <b>Symptoms observed in Animals.</b>&mdash;The main differences
between the symptoms induced in cold-blooded and warm-blooded
animals, by a fatal dose of hydric cyanide, are as follows:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The respiration in frogs is at first somewhat dyspn&#339;ic, then much
slowed, and at length it ceases. The heart, at first slowed, later contracts
irregularly, and at length gradually stops; but it may continue to beat for
several minutes after the respiration has ceased. But all these progressive
symptoms are without convulsion. Among warm-blooded animals,
on the contrary, convulsions are constant, and the sequence of the symptoms
appears to be&mdash;dyspn&#339;a, slowing of the pulse, giddiness, falling
down, then convulsions with expulsion of the urine and f&aelig;ces; dilatation
of the pupils, exophthalmus, and finally cessation of the pulse and
breathing. The convulsions also frequently pass into general paralysis,
with loss of reflex movements, weak, infrequent breathing, irregular, quick,
and very frequent pulse, and considerable diminution of temperature.</p>

<p>The commencement of the symptoms in animals is extremely rapid,
the rapidity varying according to the dose and the concentration of the
acid. It was formerly thought that the death from a large dose of the
concentrated acid followed far more quickly than could be accounted for
by the blood carrying the poison to the nervous centres; but Blake was
among the first to point out that this doubt was not supported by facts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
carefully observed, since there is always a sufficient interval between the
entry of the poison into the body and the first symptoms, to support the
theory that the poison is absorbed in the usual manner. Even when
Preyer injected a cubic centimetre of 60 per cent. acid into the jugular vein
of a rabbit, twenty-nine seconds elapsed before the symptoms commenced.
Besides, we have direct experiments showing that the acid&mdash;when applied
to wounds in limbs, the vessels of which are tied, while the free nervous
communication is left open&mdash;only acts when the ligature is removed.
Magendie describes, in his usual graphic manner, how he killed a dog by
injecting into the jugular vein prussic acid, and &#8220;<i>the dog died instantly,
as if struck by a cannon ball</i>,&#8221; but it is probable that the interval of time
was not accurately noted. A few seconds pass very rapidly, and might
be occupied even by slowly pressing the piston of the syringe down, and
in the absence of accurate measurements, it is surprising how comparatively
long intervals of time are unconsciously shortened by the mind.
In any case, this observation by Magendie has not been confirmed by the
accurate tests of the more recent experimenters; and it is universally
acknowledged that, although with strong doses of hydric cyanide injected
into the circulation&mdash;or, in other words, introduced into the system&mdash;in
the most favourable conditions for its speediest action, death occurs with
appalling suddenness, yet that it takes a time sufficiently long to admit
of explanation in the manner suggested. This has forensic importance,
which will be again alluded to. Experiments on animals show that a
large dose of a dilute acid kills quite as quickly as an equivalent dose of
a stronger acid, and in some cases it even seems to act more rapidly. If
the death does not take place within a few minutes, life may be prolonged
for hours, and even, in rare cases, days, and yet the result be
death. Coullon poisoned a dog with prussic acid; it lived for nineteen
days, and then died; but this is quite an exceptional case, and
when the fatal issue is prolonged beyond an hour, the chance of recovery
is considerable.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_260" id="Sect_260"></a>&sect; 260. The length of time dogs poisoned by fatal doses survive, generally
varies from two to fifteen minutes. The symptoms are convulsions,
insensibility of the cornea, cessation of respiration, and, finally, the heart
stops&mdash;the heart continuing to beat several minutes after the cessation of
the respirations.<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> When the dose is short of a fatal one, the symptoms
are as follows:&mdash;Evident giddiness and distress; the tongue is protruded,
the breath is taken in short, hurried gasps, there is salivation, and convulsions
rapidly set in, preceded, it may be, by a cry. The convulsions
pass into paralysis and insensibility. After remaining in this state some
time, the animal again wakes up, as it were, very often howls, and is
again convulsed; finally, it sinks into a deep sleep, and wakes up well.</p>

<p>Preyer noticed a striking difference in the symptoms after section of
the vagus in animals, which varied according to whether the poison was
administered by the lungs, or subcutaneously. In the first case, if the
dose is small, the respirations are diminished in frequency; then this is
followed by normal breathing; if the dose is larger, there is an increase
in the frequency of the respirations. Lastly, if a very large quantity is
introduced into the lungs, death quickly follows, with respirations
diminished in frequency. On the other hand, when the poison is injected
subcutaneously, small doses have no influence on the breathing; but
with large doses, there is an increase in the frequency of the respirations,
which sink again below the normal standard.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_261" id="Sect_261"></a>&sect; 261. <b>Symptoms in Man.</b>&mdash;When a fatal but not excessive dose of
either potassic or hydric cyanide is taken, the sequence of symptoms is
as follows:&mdash;Salivation, with a feeling of constriction in the throat,
nausea, and occasionally vomiting. After a few minutes a peculiar constricting
pain in the chest is felt, and the breathing is distinctly affected.
Giddiness and confusion of sight rapidly set in, and the person falls to
the ground in convulsions similar to those of epilepsy. The convulsions
are either general, or attacking only certain groups of muscles; there is
often true trismus, and the jaws are so firmly closed that nothing will
part them. The respiration is peculiar, the inspiration is short, the
expiration prolonged,<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> and between the two there is a long interval ever
becoming more protracted as death is imminent. The skin is pale, or
blue, or greyish-blue; the eyes are glassy and staring, with dilated
pupils; the mouth is covered with foam, and the breath smells of the
poison; the pulse, at first quick and small, sinks in a little while in frequency,
and at length cannot be felt. Involuntary evacuation of f&aelig;ces,
urine, and semen is often observed, and occasionally there has been
vomiting, and a portion of the vomit has been aspirated into the air-passages.
Finally, the convulsions pass into paralysis, abolition of reflex
sensibility, and gradual ceasing of the respiration. With large doses
these different stages may occur, but the course is so rapid that they are
merged the one into the other, and are undistinguishable. The shortest
time between the taking of the acid and the commencement of the
symptoms may be put at about ten seconds. If, however, a large
amount of the vapour is inhaled at once, this period may be rather
lessened. The interval of time is so short that any witnesses generally
unintentionally exaggerate, and aver that the effects were witnessed
<i>before</i> the swallowing of the liquid&mdash;&#8220;As the cup was at his lips&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
had hardly drunk it,&#8221; &amp;c. There is probably a short interval of
consciousness, then come giddiness, and, it may be, a cry for assistance;
and lastly, there is a falling down in convulsions, and a speedy death.
Convulsions are not always present, the victim occasionally appears to
sink lifeless at once. Thus, in a case related by Hufeland, a man was
seen to swallow a quantity of acid, equivalent to 40 grains of the pure
acid&mdash;that is, about forty times more than sufficient to kill him. He
staggered a few paces, and then fell dead, without sound or convulsion.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_262" id="Sect_262"></a>&sect; 262. The very short interval that may thus intervene between the
taking of a dose of prussic acid and loss of consciousness, may be utilised
by the sufferer in doing various acts, and thus this interval becomes of
immense medico-legal importance. The question is simply this:&mdash;What
can be done by a person in full possession of his faculties in ten seconds?
I have found from experiment that, after drinking a liquid from a bottle,
the bottle may be corked, the individual can get into bed, and arrange
the bedclothes in a suitable manner; he may also throw the bottle away,
or out of the window; and, indeed, with practice, in that short time a
number of rapid and complicated acts may be performed. This is borne
out both by experiments on animals and by recorded cases.</p>

<p>In Mr. Nunneley&#8217;s numerous experiments on dogs, one of the animals,
after taking poison, &#8220;went down three or four steps of the stairs, saw
that the door at the bottom was closed, and came back again.&#8221; A second
went down, came up, and went again down the steps of a long winding
staircase, and a third retained sufficient vigour to jump over another dog,
and then leap across the top of a staircase.</p>

<p>In a remarkable case related by Dr. Guy,<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> in which a young man,
after drinking more wine than usual, was seized by a sudden impulse to
take prussic acid, and drank about 2 drachms, producing symptoms which,
had it not been for prompt treatment, would, in all probability, have
ended fatally&mdash;the interval is again noteworthy. After taking the poison
in bed, he rose, walked round the foot of a chest of drawers, standing
within a few yards of the bedside, placed the stopper firmly in the bottle,
and then walked back to bed with the intention of getting into it; but
here a giddiness seized him, and he sat down on the edge, and became
insensible.</p>

<p>A case related by Taylor is still stronger. A woman, after swallowing
a fatal dose of essence of almonds, went to a well in the yard, drew water,
and drank a considerable quantity. She then ascended two flights of
stairs and called her child, again descended a flight of stairs, fell on her
bed, and died within half an hour from the taking of the poison.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, these cases and similar ones are exceptional, and only
show what is possible, not what is usual, the rule being that after fatal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>

photographers, gilders, and those who are engaged daily in the preparation
or handling of either hydric or potassic cyanides. The symptoms are
those of feeble poisoning, headache, giddiness, noises in the ears, difficult
respiration, pain over the heart, a feeling of constriction in the throat,
loss of appetite, nausea, obstinate constipation, full pulse, with pallor
and offensive breath. Koritschoner<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> has made some observations on
patients who were made to breathe at intervals, during many weeks,
prussic acid vapour, with the idea that such a treatment would destroy

suffered from redness of the pharynx, salivation, headache, nausea, vomiting,

of consideration any changes which may be seen in the stomach after
doses of potassic cyanide, then it may be affirmed that the pathological
changes produced by hydric and potassic cyanides mainly coincide with
those produced by suffocation. The most striking appearance is the
presence of bright red spots; these bright red spots or patches are confined
to the surface of the body, the blood in the deeper parts being of
the ordinary venous hue, unless, indeed, an enormous dose has been
taken; in that case the whole mass of blood may be bright red; this
bright colour is due, according to Kobert, to the formation of cyanmeth&aelig;moglobin.
The lungs and right heart are full of blood, and there
is a backward engorgement produced by the pulmonic block. The veins
of the neck and the vessels of the head generally are full of blood, and,
in like manner, the liver and kidneys are congested. In the mucous
membrane of the bronchial tubes there is a bloody foam, the lungs are
gorged, and often &#339;dematous in portions; ecchymoses are seen in the
pleura and other serous membranes; and everywhere, unless concealed
by putrefaction, or some strong-smelling ethereal oil, there is an odour of
hydric cyanide.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_249" id="Footnote_249"></a><a href="#FNanchor_249"><span class="label">[249]</span></a> Hydric cyanide has, according to C. Brame, a remarkable antiseptic
action, and if administered in sufficient quantity to animals, preserves
them after death for a month. He considers that there is some more or
less definite combination with the tissues.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>Casper has rightly recommended the head to be opened and examined
first, so as to detect the odour, if present, in the brain. The abdominal
and chest cavities usually possess a putrefactive smell, but the brain is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
longer conserved, so that, if this course be adopted, there is a greater
probability of detecting the odour.</p>

<p>The stomach in poisoning by hydric cyanide is not inflamed, but if
alcohol has been taken at the same time, or previously, there may be
more or less redness.</p>

<p>In poisoning by potassic cyanide, the appearances are mainly the same
as those just detailed, with, it may be, the addition of caustic local action.
I have, however, seen, in the case of a gentleman who drank accidentally
a considerable dose of potassic cyanide just after a full meal, not the
slightest trace of any redness, still less of corrosion. Here the contents
of the stomach protected the mucous membrane, or possibly the larger
amount of acid poured out during digestion sufficiently neutralised the
alkali. Potassic cyanide, in very strong solution, may cause erosions of
the lips, and the caustic effect may be traced in the mouth, throat, gullet,
to the stomach and duodenum; but this is unusual, and the local effects
are, as a rule, confined to the stomach and duodenum. The mucous
membrane is coloured blood-red, reacts strongly alkaline,<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> is swollen, and
it may be even ulcerated. The upper layers of the epithelium are also
often dyed with the colouring-matter of the blood, which has been dissolved
out by the cyanide. This last change is a <i>post-mortem</i> effect, and
can be imitated by digesting the mucous membrane of a healthy stomach
in a solution of cyanide. The intensity of these changes are, of course,
entirely dependent on the dose and emptiness of the stomach. If the
dose is so small as just to destroy life, there may be but little redness or
swelling of the stomach, although empty at the time of taking the poison.
In those cases in which there has been vomiting, and a part of the vomit
has been drawn into the air-passages, there may be also inflammatory
changes in the larynx. If essence of almonds has been swallowed, the
same slight inflammation may be seen which has been observed with
other essential oils, but no erosion, no strong alkaline reaction, nor anything
approaching the effects of the caustic cyanide.</p>

The face was flushed, the body not decomposed; the mouth smelt strongly
of cyanide; the stomach had about an ounce of bloody fluid in it, and
was in a most intense state of congestion. There was commencing fatty
degeneration of the liver, the kidneys were flabby, and the capsule
adherent. The contents of the stomach showed cyanide of potassium, and
the blood was very fluid. The woman was known to be of intemperate

The addition of silver nitrate to a solution containing prussic acid,
or a soluble cyanide,<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> produces a precipitate of argentic cyanide. 100
parts of argentic cyanide are composed of 80&middot;60 <span class="chemform">Ag</span> and 19&middot;4 <span class="chemform">CN</span>,
equivalent to 20&middot;1 <span class="chemform">HCN</span>. It is a white anhydrous precipitate, soluble
either in ammonia or in a solution of cyanide of potassium. It is soluble
in hot dilute nitric acid, but separates on cooling. A particle of silver
cyanide, moistened with strong ammonia, develops needles; silver chloride
treated similarly, octahedral crystals. It is insoluble in water. Upon
ignition it is decomposed into <span class="chemform">CN</span> and metallic silver, mixed with a little
paracyanide of silver.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_251" id="Footnote_251"></a><a href="#FNanchor_251"><span class="label">[251]</span></a> In the case of testing in this way for the alkaline cyanides, the
solution must contain a little free nitric acid.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>A very neat process for the identification of cyanide of silver is the
following:&mdash;Place the perfectly dry cyanide in a closed or sealed tube,
containing a few crystals of iodine. On heating slightly, iodide of
cyanogen is sublimed in beautiful needles. These crystals again may be
dissolved in a dilute solution of potash, a little ferrous sulphate added,
and hydrochloric acid, and in this way Prussian blue produced. If the
quantity to be tested is small, the vapour of the acid may be evolved in
a very short test-tube, the mouth of which is closed by the ordinary thin
discs of microscopic glass, the under surface of which is moistened with a
solution of nitrate of silver; the resulting crystals of silver cyanide are
very characteristic, and readily identified by the microscope.</p>

<p>(2.) If, instead of silver nitrate, the disc be moistened with a solution
of sulphate of iron (to which has been added a little potash), and exposed
to the vapour a short time, and then some dilute hydrochloric acid added,
the moistened surface first becomes yellow, then green, lastly, and permanently,
blue. No other blue compound of iron (with the exception of
Prussian blue) is insoluble in dilute hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p>(3.) A third, and perhaps the most delicate of all, is the so-called
sulphur test. A yellow sulphide of ammonium, containing free sulphur,
is prepared by saturating ammonia by <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>, first suspending in the fluid
a little finely-precipitated sulphur (or an old, ill-preserved solution of
sulphide of ammonium may be used). Two watch-glasses are now taken;
in the one the fluid containing prussic acid is put, and the second (previously
moistened with the sulphide of ammonium described) is inverted
over it. The glasses are conveniently placed for a few minutes in the
water-oven; the upper one is then removed, the moist surface evaporated
to dryness in the water-bath, a little water added, and then a small drop
of solution of chloride of iron. If hydrocyanic acid is present, the
sulphocyanide of iron will be formed of a striking blood-red
colour.</p>

<p>(4.) The reaction usually called Sch&ouml;nbein&#8217;s, or Pagenstecher and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Sch&ouml;nbein&#8217;s<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> (but long known,<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> and used before the publication of their
paper), consists of guaiacum paper, moistened with a very dilute solution
of sulphate of copper (1&nbsp;: 2000). This becomes blue if exposed to the
vapour of hydrocyanic acid. Unfortunately, the same reaction is produced
by ammonia, ozone, nitric acid, hypochlorous acid, iodine, bromine,
chromate of potash, and other oxidising agents, so that its usefulness is
greatly restricted.</p>

alkali.</p>

<p>(7.) <b>Sch&ouml;nbein&#8217;s Test.</b>&mdash;To a few drops of defibrinated ox-blood are
added a few drops of the carefully-neutralised distillate supposed to contain
prussic acid, and then a little neutral peroxide of hydrogen is added.
If the distillate contains no prussic acid, then the mixture becomes of a
bright pure red and froths strongly; if, on the other hand, a trace of
prussic acid be present, the liquid becomes brown and does not froth, or
only slightly does so.</p>

<p>(8.) <b>Kobert&#8217;s Test.</b>&mdash;A 1-4 per cent. solution of blood, to which a
trace of ferridcyanide of potassium is added, is prepared, and the neutralised
distillate added to this solution. If hydric cyanide be present,
then the liquid becomes of a bright red colour, and, examined spectroscopically,
instead of the spectrum of meth&aelig;moglobin, will be seen the
spectrum of cyanmeth&aelig;moglobin. Kobert proposes to examine the blood
of the poisoned, for the purpose of diagnosis, during life. A drop of
blood from a healthy person, and a drop of blood from the patient, are
examined side by side, according to the process just given.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_266" id="Sect_266"></a>&sect; 266. <b>Separation of Hydric Cyanide or Potassic Cyanide from
Organic Matters, such as the Contents of the Stomach, &amp;c.</b>&mdash;It is
very necessary, before specially searching for hydric cyanide in the contents
of the stomach, to be able to say, by careful and methodical
examination, whether there are or are not any fragments of bitter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
almonds, of apples, peaches, or other substance likely to produce hydric
cyanide. If potassic cyanide has been taken, simple distillation will
always reveal its presence, because it is found partly decomposed into
hydric cyanide by the action of the gastric acids. Nevertheless, an acid
should always be added, and if, as in the routine process given at <a href="#Page_48">p. 48</a>,
there is reasonable doubt for suspecting that there will be no cyanide
present, it will be best to add tartaric acid (for this organic acid will in
no way interfere with subsequent operations), and distil, as recommended,
in a vacuum. If, however, from the odour and from the history of the
case, it is pretty sure to be a case of poisoning by hydric or potassic
cyanide, then the substances, if fluid, are at once placed in a retort or
flask, and acidified with a suitable quantity of sulphuric acid, or if the
tissues or other solid matters are under examination, they are finely
divided, or pulped, and distilled, after acidifying with sulphuric acid as
before. It may be well here, as a caution, to remark that the analyst
must not commit the unpardonable error of first producing a cyanide
by reagents acting on animal matters, and then detecting as a poison
the cyanide thus manufactured. If, for example, a healthy liver is
carbonised by nitric acid, saturated with potash, and then burnt up,
cyanide of potassium is always one of the products; and, indeed, the
ashes of a great variety of nitrogenous organic substances may contain
cyanides&mdash;cyanides not pre-existing, but manufactured by combination.

all cases, the readiest method of estimating prussic acid (whether it be
in the distillate from organic substances or in aqueous solution) is to
saturate it with soda or potash, and titrate the alkaline cyanide thus
formed with nitrate of silver. The process is based on the fact that
there is first formed a soluble compound (<span class="chemform">KCy</span>, <span class="chemform">AgCy</span>), which the
slightest excess of silver breaks up, and the insoluble cyanide is at once
precipitated. If grains are used, 17 grains of nitrate of silver are
dissolved in water, the solution made up to exactly 1000 grain measures,
each grain measure equalling &middot;0054 grain of anhydrous hydrocyanic acid.
If grammes are employed, the strength of the nitrate of silver solution
should be 1&middot;7 grm. to the litre, each c.c. then = &middot;0054 hydrocyanic acid, or
&middot;01302 grm. of potassic cyanide.</p>

<p>Essential oil of bitter almonds may also be titrated in this way, provided
it is diluted with sufficient spirit to prevent turbidity from separation
of the essential oil. If hydrocyanic acid is determined gravimetrically
(which is sometimes convenient, when only a single estimation
is to be made), it is precipitated as cyanide of silver, the characters of
which have been already described.</p>

<p>A maid-servant, 31 years of age, after a quarrel with her lover, ate a quantity of
bitter almonds. In a few minutes she sighed, complained of being unwell and faint;
she vomited twice, and, after about ten minutes more had elapsed, fell senseless and
was convulsed. An hour afterwards, a physician found her insensible, the eyes
rolled upwards, the thumb clenched within the shut fists, and the breathing
rattling, the pulse very slow. She died within an hour-and-a-half from the first
symptoms.</p>

<p>The autopsy showed the organs generally healthy, but all, save the liver, exhaling
a faint smell of bitter almonds. The right side of the heart was full of fluid dark
blood, the left was empty. Both lungs were rich in blood, which smelt of prussic
acid. The stomach was not inflamed&mdash;it held 250 grms. of a yellow fluid, containing
white flocks smelling of bitter almond oil. In the most dependent portion of the
stomach there was a swollen patch of mucous membrane, partially denuded of
epithelium. The mucous membrane of the duodenum was also swollen and slightly
red. The contents of the stomach were acid, and yielded, on distillation, hydride of
benzole and hydric cyanide. Residues of the almonds themselves were also found,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"><span class="fsize110">[210]</span></a></span>
and the whole quantity taken by the woman from various data was calculated to be
1200 grains of bitter almonds, equal to 43 grains of amygdalin, or 2&middot;5 grains of pure

<p>A weak stream of ammonic cyanide vapour was passed into glass shades, under

cyanide can be separated through dilute acids, while those which, like potassic ferro-cyanide,
do not admit of this decomposition, may be often taken with impunity, and
are only poisonous under certain conditions.</p>

<p>Sonnenschein records the death of a colourist, after he had taken a dose of potassic
ferro-cyanide and then one of tartaric acid; and Volz describes the death of a man,
who took potassic ferro-cyanide and afterwards equal parts of nitric and hydrochloric
acids. In this latter case, death took place within the hour, with all the symptoms
of poisoning by hydric cyanide; so that it is not entirely true, as most text-books
declare, that ferro-cyanide is in no degree poisonous. Carbon dioxide will decompose
potassic ferro-cyanide at 72&deg;-74&deg;, potass ferrous cyanide being precipitated&mdash;<span class="chemform">K<sub>2</sub>Fe<sub>2</sub>(CN)<sub>6</sub></span>.

happen that potassic or sodic cyanide has been taken as well as
ferro-cyanide, and it will be necessary then to devise a process by
which only the prussic acid from the simple cyanide is distilled over.
According to Autenrieth, if sodium hydrocarbonate is added to the liquid
in sufficient quantity and the liquid distilled, the hydric cyanide that
comes over is derived wholly from the sodium or potassium cyanide.
Should mercury cyanide and ferro-cyanide be taken together, then this
process requires modification; bicarbonate of soda is added as before,
and then a few c.c. of water saturated with hydric sulphide; under these
circumstances, only the hydric cyanide derived from the mercury cyanide
distils over. If the bicarbonate of soda is omitted, the distillate

specific gravity 1&middot;178, percentage composition, phosphorus 91&middot;43, hydrogen
8&middot;57 by weight. The absolutely pure gas is not spontaneously inflammable,
but that made by the ordinary process is so. It is a colourless,
highly poisonous gas, which does not support combustion, but is itself
combustible, burning to phosphoric acid (<span class="chemform">PH<sub>3</sub></span>&nbsp;+ <span class="chemform">2O<sub>2</sub></span> = <span class="chemform">PO<sub>4</sub>H<sub>3</sub></span>). Extremely
dangerous explosive mixtures may be made by combining
phosphine and air or oxygen. Phosphine, when quite dry, burns with a
white flame, but if mixed with aqueous vapour, it is green; hence a
hydrogen flame containing a mixture of <span class="chemform">PH<sub>3</sub></span> possesses a green colour.</p>

<p>If sulphur is heated in a stream of phosphine, hydric sulphide and
sulphur phosphide are the products. Oxides of the metals, heated with
phosphine, yield phosphides with formation of water. Iodine, warmed in
phosphine, gives white crystals of iodine phosphonium, and biniodide of
phosphorus, <span class="chemform">5I</span>&nbsp;+ <span class="chemform">4PH<sub>3</sub></span> = <span class="chemform">3PIH<sub>4</sub></span>&nbsp;+ <span class="chemform">PI<sub>2</sub></span>. Chlorine inflames the gas, the
final result being hydric chloride and chloride of phosphorus, <span class="chemform">PH<sub>3</sub></span>&nbsp;+
<span class="chemform">8Cl</span> = <span class="chemform">3ClH</span>&nbsp;+ <span class="chemform">PCl<sub>5</sub></span>. One of the most important decompositions for
our purpose is the action of phosphine on a solution of nitrate of
silver; there is a separation of metallic silver, and nitric and phosphoric
acids are found in solution, thus&mdash;<span class="chemform">8AgNO<sub>3</sub></span>&nbsp;+ <span class="chemform">PH<sub>3</sub></span>&nbsp;+ <span class="chemform">4OH<sub>2</sub></span> = <span class="chemform">8Ag</span>&nbsp;+
<span class="chemform">8HNO<sub>3</sub></span>&nbsp;+ <span class="chemform">PO<sub>4</sub>H<sub>3</sub></span>. This is, however, rather the end reaction; for, at
first, there is a separation of a black precipitate composed of phosphor-silver.
The excess of silver can be separated by hydric chloride, and
the phosphoric acid made evident by the addition of molybdic acid in
excess.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_278" id="Sect_278"></a>&sect; 278. <b>Effects of Phosphorus.</b>&mdash;Phosphorus is excessively poisonous,
and will destroy life, provided only that it enters the body in a fine state of
division, but if taken in coarse pieces no symptoms may follow, for it has
been proved that single lumps of phosphorus will go the whole length of a
dog&#8217;s intestinal canal without causing appreciable loss of weight, and without
destroying life.<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> Magendie injected <i>oleum phosphoratum</i> into the veins,
and although the animals experimented on exhaled white fumes, and not a
few died asphyxiated, yet no symptoms of phosphorus poisoning resulted&mdash;an
observation confirmed by others&mdash;the reason being that the phosphorus
particles in a comparatively coarse state of division were arrested
in the capillaries of the lung, and may be said to have been, as it were,
outside the body. On the other hand, A. Brunner,<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> working in L.
Hermann&#8217;s laboratory, having injected into the veins phosphorus in such
a fine emulsion that the phosphorus could pass the lung capillaries,
found that there were no exhalations of white fumes, but that the
ordinary symptoms of phosphorus poisoning soon manifested themselves.
Phosphorus paste, by the method of manufacture, is in a state of extreme
sub-division, and hence all the phosphorus pastes are extremely poisonous.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_279" id="Sect_279"></a>&sect; 279. In a few poisons there is a difference, more or less marked,
between the general symptoms produced on man, and those noticeable in
the different classes of animals; but with phosphorus, the effects on
animals appear to agree fairly with those witnessed most frequently in
man. Tardieu (who has written perhaps the best and most complete clinical
record of phosphorus poisoning extant) divides the cases under three
classes, and to use his own words:&mdash;&#8220;I think it useful to establish that
poisoning by phosphorus in its course, sometimes rapid, sometimes slow,
exhibits in its symptoms three distinct forms&mdash;a common form, a nervous
form, and a h&aelig;morrhagic form. I recognise that, in certain cases, these
three forms may succeed each other, and may only constitute periods of
poisoning; but it is incontestable that each of them may show itself alone,
and occupy the whole course of the illness produced by the poison.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>
Premising that the common form is a blending of irritant, nervous, and
h&aelig;morrhagic symptoms, I adopt here in part Tardieu&#8217;s division. The
name of &#8220;h&aelig;morrhagic form&#8221; may be given to that in which h&aelig;morrhage
is the predominant feature, and the &#8220;nervous&#8221; to that in which the brain
and spinal cord are from the first affected. There yet remain, however,
a few cases which have an entirely anomalous course, and do not fall
under any of the three classes.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>From a study of 121 recorded cases of phosphorus poisoning, I believe
the relative frequency of the different forms to be as follows:&mdash;The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
common form 83 per cent., h&aelig;morrhagic 10 per cent., nervous 6 per cent.,
anomalous 1 per cent. The &#8220;anomalous&#8221; are probably over-estimated,
for the reason that cases presenting ordinary features are not necessarily
published, but others are nearly always chronicled in detail.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_280" id="Sect_280"></a>&sect; 280. <b>Common Form.</b>&mdash;At the moment of swallowing, a disagreeable
taste and smell are generally experienced, and there may be immediate
and intense pain in the throat, gullet, and stomach, and almost immediate
retching and vomiting. The throat and tongue also may become swollen
and painful; but in a considerable number of cases the symptoms are not
at once apparent, but are delayed from one to six hours&mdash;rarely longer.
The person&#8217;s breath may be phosphorescent before he feels in any way
affected, and he may go about his business and perform a number of acts
requiring both time and mental integrity. Pain in the stomach (which,
in some of the cases, takes the form of violent cramp and vomiting)
succeeds; the matters vomited may shine in the dark, and are often tinged
with blood. Diarrh&#339;a is sometimes present, sometimes absent; sleeplessness
for the first night or two is very common. The pulse is variable,
sometimes frequent, sometimes slow; the temperature in the morning is
usually from 36&middot;0&deg; to 36&middot;5&deg;, in the evening 37&deg; to 38&deg;.</p>

<p>The next symptom is jaundice. I have notes of the exact occurrence
of jaundice in 23 cases, as follows:&mdash;In 1 within twenty-four hours, in
3 within thirty-six hours, in 3 within two days, in 11 within three days,
in 1 within four days, in 1 within five days, in 1 within nine days, in 1
within eighteen days, and in 1 within twenty-seven days; so that in
about 78 per cent. jaundice occurred before the end of the third day.
Out of 26 cases, in which the patients lived long enough for the
occurrence of jaundice, in 3 (or 11 per cent.) it was entirely absent. In
132 cases recorded by Lewin, Meischner, and Heisler, jaundice occurred
in 65, or about 49 per cent., but it must be remembered, that in many
of these cases the individual died before it had time to develop. The
jaundice having thoroughly pronounced itself, the system may be considered
as not only under the influence of the toxic action of phosphorus,
but as suffering in addition from all the accidents incidental to the
retention of the biliary secretion in the blood; nor is there from this
point any special difference between phosphorus poisoning and certain
affections of the liver&mdash;such, for example, as acute yellow atrophy. There
is retention of urine, sleeplessness, headache, frequent vomiting, painful
and often involuntary evacuations from the bowels, and occasionally skin
affections, such as urticaria or erythema. The case terminates either by
acute delirium with fever, followed by fatal coma, or, in a few instances,
coma comes on, and the patient passes to death in sleep without delirium.
In this common form there is in a few cases, at the end of from twenty-four
to thirty hours, a remission of the symptoms, and a non-medical observer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
might imagine that the patient was about to recover without further
discomfort; but then jaundice supervenes, and the course is as described.
Infants often do not live long enough for the jaundiced stage to develop,
but die within twenty-four hours, the chief symptoms being vomiting
and convulsions.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_281" id="Sect_281"></a>&sect; 281. <b>H&aelig;morrhagic Form.</b>&mdash;The symptoms set in as just detailed,
and jaundice appears, but accompanied by a new and terrible train of
events&mdash;viz., great effusion of blood. In some cases the blood has been
poured out simultaneously from the nose, mouth, bladder, kidneys, and
bowels. Among women there is excessive h&aelig;morrhagia. The liver is
found to be swollen and painful; the bodily weakness is great. Such
cases are usually of long duration, and a person may die months after
taking the poison from weakness, an&aelig;mia, and general cachexia. In
many of its phases the h&aelig;morrhagic form resembles scurvy, and, as in
scurvy, there are spots of purpura all over the body.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_282" id="Sect_282"></a>&sect; 282. <b>The nervous form</b> is less common than the two forms just
described. From the beginning, there are strange creeping sensations
about the limbs, followed by painful cramps, repeated faintings, and great
somnolence. Jaundice, as usual, sets in, erythematous spots appear on
the skin, and, about the fifth day, delirium of an acute character breaks
out, and lock-jaw and convulsions close the scene.</p>

<p>The following are one or two brief abstracts of anomalous cases in
which symptoms are either wanting, or run a course entirely different
from any of the three forms described:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>A woman, aged 20, took about 3 grains of phosphorus in the form
of rat-paste. She took the poison at six in the evening, behaved according
to her wont, and sat down and wrote a letter to the king. During
the night she vomited once, and died the next morning at six o&#8217;clock,
exactly twelve hours after taking the poison. There appear to have been
no symptoms whatever, save the single vomiting, to which may be added
that in the course of the evening her breath had a phosphorus odour and
was luminous.<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p><a name="Sect_284" id="Sect_284"></a>&sect; 284. <b>Period at which the first Symptoms commence.</b>&mdash;The time
when the symptoms commence is occasionally of importance from a
forensic point of view. I find that out of 28 cases in which the commencement
of evident symptoms&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, pain, or vomiting, or illness&mdash;is
precisely recorded, in 8 the symptoms were described as either immediate
or within a few minutes after swallowing the poison; in 6 the symptoms
commenced within the hour; in 3 within two hours; in other 3 within
four hours; and in 1 within six hours. One was delayed until the lapse
of twelve hours, 1 from sixteen to eighteen hours, 1 two, and another
five days. We may, therefore, expect that in half the cases which may
occur, the symptoms will commence within the hour, and more than 80
per cent. within six hours.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_285" id="Sect_285"></a>&sect; 285. <b>Period of Death.</b>&mdash;In 129 cases death took place as follows:&mdash;In
17 within twenty-four hours, in 30 within two days, in 103 within
seven days. Three patients lived eight days, 6 nine days, 13 ten days,
1 eleven days, 1 sixteen days, 1 seventeen days, and 1 survived eight
months. It hence follows that 79&middot;8 per cent. of the fatal cases die
within the week.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_286" id="Sect_286"></a>&sect; 286. <b>Phosphorus Vapour.</b>&mdash;There are one or two cases on record of
acute poisoning by phosphorus in the form of vapour. The symptoms
are somewhat different from the effects produced by the finely-divided
solid, and in general terms it may be said that phosphorus vapour is more
apt to produce the rarer &#8220;nervous&#8221; form of poisoning than the solid
phosphorus.</p>

<p>Bouchardat<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> mentions the case of a druggist who, while preparing a
large quantity of rat-poison in a close room, inhaled phosphorus vapour.
He fainted repeatedly, fell into a complete state of prostration, and died
within a week.</p>

<p>The following interesting case came under the observation of Professor
Magnus Huss:&mdash;A man, thirty-nine years old, married, was admitted into
the Seraphin-Lazareth, Stockholm, on the 2nd of February 1842. He
had been occupied three years in the manufacture of phosphorus matches,
and inhabited the room in which the materials were preserved. He had
always been well-conducted in every way, and in good health, until a year
previously, when a large quantity of the material for the manufacture of
the matches accidentally caught fire and exploded. In his endeavours to
extinguish the flames, he breathed a large quantity of the vapour, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
he fell for a time unconscious. The spine afterwards became so weak
that he could not hold himself up, and he lost, in a great measure, power
over his legs and arms. On admission, his condition was as follows:&mdash;He
could make a few uncertain and staggering steps, his knees trembled,
his arms shook, and if he attempted to grasp anything when he lay in
bed, there were involuntary twitchings of groups of muscles. There was
no pain; the sensibility of the skin was unchanged; he had formication
in the left arm; the spine was neither sensitive to pressure, nor unusually
sensitive to heat (as, <i>e.g.</i>, to the application of a hot sponge); the organs
of special sense were not affected, but his speech was somewhat thick.
He lived to 1845 in the same condition, but the paralysis became worse.
There does not seem to have been any autopsy.</p>

<p>The effects of phosphorus vapour may be still further elucidated by
one of Eulenberg&#8217;s<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> experiments on a rabbit. The vapour of burning
phosphorus, mixed with much air, was admitted into a wooden hutch in
which a strong rabbit sat. After 5 mgrms. of phosphorus had been in
this manner consumed, the only symptoms in half an hour were salivation,
and quickened and somewhat laboured respiration. After twenty-four
hours had elapsed there was sudden indisposition, the animal fell as if
lifeless, with the hind extremities stretched out, and intestinal movements
were visible; there was also expulsion of the urine. These epileptiform
seizures seem to have continued more or less for twelve days, and then
ceased. After fourteen days the experiment was repeated on the same
rabbit. The animal remained exposed to the vapour for three-quarters
of an hour, when the epilepsy showed itself as before, and, indeed, almost
regularly after feeding. Between the attacks the respiration was slowed.
Eight weeks afterwards there was an intense icterus, which disappeared
at the end of ten weeks.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_287" id="Sect_287"></a>&sect; 287. <b>Chronic phosphorus poisoning</b> has frequently been noticed in
persons engaged either in the manufacture of phosphorus or in its technical
application. Some have held that the symptoms are due to an
oxidation product of phosphorus rather than to phosphorus itself; but in
one of Eulenberg&#8217;s experiments, in which a dove was killed by breathing
phosphorus fumes evolved by phosphorus oil, phosphorus was chemically
recognised in the free state in the lungs. The most constant and peculiar
effect of breathing small quantities of phosphorus vapour is a necrosis of
the lower jaw. There is first inflammation of the periosteum of the jaw,
which proceeds to suppuration and necrosis of a greater or smaller portion.
The effects may develop with great suddenness, and end fatally.
Thus Fournier and Olliver<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> relate the case of a girl, fourteen years old,
who, after working four years in a phosphorus manufactory, was suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
affected with periostitis of the upper jaw, and with intense an&aelig;mia.
An eruption of purpuric spots ensued, and she died comatose. There
is now little doubt, that minute doses of phosphorus have a specific
action on the bones generally, and more especially on the bones of the
jaw. Wegner<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> administered small daily doses to young animals, both
in the state of vapour, and as a finely-divided solid. The condition of
the bones was found to be more compact than normal, the medullary
canals being smaller than in healthy bone, the ossification was quickened.
The formation of callus in fractured limbs was also increased.</p>

that, at a certain period of the illness, the renal secretion is scantier than
in health, the urine diminishing, according to Lebert and Wyss&#8217;s<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>
researches, to one-half on the third, fourth, or fifth day. It frequently
contains albumen, blood, and casts. When jaundice is present, the urine
has then all the characters noticed in icterus; leucin and tyrosin, always
present in acute yellow atrophy of the liver, have been found in small
quantity in jaundice through phosphorus; lactic acid is also present.
The urea is much diminished, and, according to Schultzen and Riess,<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>
may be towards death entirely absent. Lastly, it is said that there is an
exhalation of either phosphorus vapour or phosphine from such urine.
In some cases the urine is normal, <i>e.g.</i>, in a case recorded by E. H.
Starling, M.D., and F. G. Hopkins, B.Sc. (<i>Guy&#8217;s Hospital Report</i>, 1890),
in which a girl, aged 18, died on the fifth day after taking phosphorus
paste, the liver was fatty, and there was jaundice; but the
urine contained neither leucin nor tyrosin, and was stated to be generally
normal.</p>

a man took the paste from 300 matches, and under treatment by turpentine
recovered, the blood was frequently examined, and the leucocytes
found much increased in number. There is a curious conflict of evidence
as to whether phosphorus prevents coagulation of the blood or not.
Nasse asserted that phosphorated oil given to a dog fully prevented
coagulation; P. I. Liebreck<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> also, in a series of researches, found the

<p>In a second experiment with another pigeon, there was no striking
symptom save that of increased frequency of respiration and loss of
appetite; at the end of four days it was found dead. There was much
congestion of the cerebral veins and vessels, the mucous membrane of the
trachea and bronchi were weakly injected, and the first showed a thin,
plastic, diphtheritic-like exudation.</p>

<p>Dr. Henderson&#8217;s<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> researches on rats may also be noticed here. He
found that an atmosphere consisting entirely of phosphine killed rats
within ten minutes, an atmosphere with 1 per cent. in half an hour.
The symptoms observed were almost exactly similar to those noticed in
the first experiment on the pigeon quoted above, and the <i>post-mortem</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
appearances were not dissimilar. With smaller quantities of the gas, the
first symptom was increased frequency of the respiration; then the
animals showed signs of suffering intense irritation of the skin, scratching
and biting at it incessantly; afterwards they became drowsy, and assumed
a very peculiar attitude, sitting down on all-fours, with the back bent forward,
and the nose pushed backwards between the forepaws, so as to bring
the forehead against the floor of the cage. When in this position, the
rat presented the appearance of a curled-up hedgehog. Phosphine, when
injected into the rectum, is also fatal; the animals exhale some of the
gas from the lungs, and the breath, therefore, reduces solutions of silver
nitrate.<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p>Brenner<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> has recorded the case of a man twenty-eight years old, a
pharmaceutist, who is supposed to have suffered from illness caused by
repeated inhalations of minute quantities of phosphine. He was engaged
for two and a half years in the preparation of hypophosphites; his illness
commenced with spots before the eyes, and inability to fix the attention.
His teeth became very brittle, and healthy as well as carious broke off
from very slight causes. Finally, a weakness of the arms and limbs
developed in the course of nine months into complete locomotor ataxy.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_292" id="Sect_292"></a>&sect; 292. Blood takes up far more phosphine than water. Dybskowsky
found that putting the coefficient of solubility of phosphine in pure water
at &middot;1122 at 15&deg;, the coefficient for venous blood was &middot;13, and for arterial
26&middot;73; hence the richer the blood is in oxygen the more phosphine is
absorbed. It seems probable that the poisonous gas reacts on the
oxyh&aelig;moglobin of the blood, and phosphorous acid is formed. This is
supported by the fact that a watery extract of such blood reduces silver
nitrate, and has been also found feebly acid. The dark blood obtained
from animals poisoned by phosphine, when examined spectroscopically,
has been found to exhibit a band in the violet.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_293" id="Sect_293"></a>&sect; 293. <b>Post-mortem Appearances.</b>&mdash;There are a few perfectly well
authenticated cases showing that phosphorus may cause death, and yet no
lesion be discovered afterwards. Thus, Tardieu<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> cites a case in which a
woman, aged 45, poisoned herself with phosphorus, and died suddenly
the seventh day afterwards. Dr. Mascarel examined the viscera with
the greatest care, but could discover absolutely no abnormal conditions;
the only symptoms during life were vomiting, and afterwards a little
indigestion. It may, however, be remarked that the microscope does not
seem to have been employed, and that probably a close examination of
the heart would have revealed some alteration of its ultimate structure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
The case quoted, by Taylor<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> may also be mentioned, in which a child
was caught in the act of sucking phosphorus matches, and died ten days
afterwards in convulsions. None of the ordinary <i>post-mortem</i> signs of
poisoning by phosphorus were met with, but the intestines were reddened
throughout, and there were no less than ten invaginations; but the case
is altogether a doubtful one, and no phosphorus may actually have been
taken. It is very difficult to give in a limited space anything like a full
picture of the different lesions found after death from phosphorus, for they
vary according as to whether the death is speedy or prolonged, whether
the phosphorus has been taken as a finely-divided solid, or in the form
of vapour, &amp;c. It may, however, be shortly said, that the most common
changes are fatty infiltration of the liver and kidneys, fatty degeneration
of the heart, enlargement of the liver, ecchymoses in the serous membranes,
in the muscular, in the fatty, and in the mucous tissues. When
death occurs before jaundice supervenes, there may be little in the aspect
of the corpse to raise a suspicion of poison; but if intense jaundice has
existed during life, the yellow staining of the skin, and it may be, spots
of purpura, will suggest to the experienced pathologist the possibility of
phosphorus poisoning. In the mouth and throat there will seldom be anything
abnormal. In one or two cases of rapid death among infants, some
traces of the matches which had been sucked were found clinging to the
gums. The stomach may be healthy, but the most common appearance is
a swelling of the mucous membrane and superficial erosions. Virchow,<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>
who was the first to call attention to this peculiar grey swelling of the
intestinal mucous membrane under the name of <i>gastritis glandularis</i>
or <i>gastradenitis</i>, shows that it is due to a fatty degeneration of
the epithelial cells, and that it is by no means peculiar to phosphorus
poisoning. The swelling may be seen in properly-prepared sections to
have its essential seat in the glands of the mucous membrane; the glands
are enlarged, their openings filled with large cells, and each single cell is
finely granular. Little centres of h&aelig;morrhage, often microscopically
small, are seen, and may be the centres of small inflammations; their
usual situation is on the summit of the rug&aelig;. Very similar changes are
witnessed after death from septic&aelig;mia, py&aelig;mia, diphtheria, and other
diseases. The softening of the stomach, gangrene, and deep erosions,
recorded by the earlier authors, have not been observed of late years, and
probably were due to <i>post-mortem</i> changes, and not to processes during
life. The same changes are to be seen in the intestines, and there are
numerous extravasations in the peritoneum.</p>

those produced by yellow atrophy, deserves fuller notice:&mdash;&#8220;Frances A.
Cowley, aged 20, on her own admission, took some rat paste on Tuesday,
June 19th. Death ensued eleven days later. The initial symptoms were not
very marked. Nausea and vomiting continued with moderate severity for a
few days and then ceased. There ensued a feeling of depression. Towards
the end insensibility, icterus, and somewhat profuse metrorrhagia
supervened. At the necropsy the skin and conjunctiv&aelig; were observed of a
bright yellow colour. There was no organic disease save of a recent
nature, and entirely attributable to the action of the poison ingested.
The stomach contained about three-quarters of a pint of dark
claret-coloured fluid, consisting largely of blood derived from
capillary h&aelig;morrhage from the mucous membrane. There was no solution of
continuity of the mucous membrane, which showed traces of recent
irritation. The whole surface presented a yellow icteric tint, except
the summits of some of the rug&aelig;, which were of a bright pink colour.
There was also faint wrinkling of the mucous membrane. The upper part of
the small intestine was affected in much the same manner as the stomach.
The large intestine contained a quantity of almost colourless f&aelig;ces. The
liver was shrunken, weighing only 26 ozs., and both on its outer and
sectional surface exactly resembled the appearances produced by acute
yellow atrophy, except that there were greater congestion and
interstitial h&aelig;morrhage in patches. The lobules of the liver were in
many places unrecognisable; in others they stood in bold relief as
brilliant canary-yellow patches, standing in strong contrast to the deep
dark-red areas of congestion and extravasation. The gall-bladder
contained about 2 drachms of thin greyish fluid, apparently all but
devoid of bile. The urinary bladder was empty; the kidneys were
enlarged; the cortex was very pale and bile-stained, of greater depth
than natural, and of softer consistence. The spleen was not enlarged,
nor was it in the least degree softened. In addition to the bleeding
from the uterus noticed during life, there was capillary h&aelig;morrhage into
the right lung and pleura, into the pericardium, and, as already
mentioned, into the stomach. The brain was healthy.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>In the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons there is a preparation
(No. 2737) of the section of a liver derived from a case of phosphorus
poisoning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>A girl, aged 18, after two days&#8217; illness, was admitted into Guy&#8217;s
Hospital. She confessed to having eaten a piece of bread coated with
phosphorus paste. She had great abdominal pain, and died on the
seventh day after taking the phosphorus. A few hours before her death
she was profoundly and suddenly collapsed. The liver weighed 66 ozs.
The outlines of the hepatic lobules were very distinct, each central vein
being surrounded by an opaque yellowish zone; when fresh the hue was
more uniform, and the section was yellowish-white in colour. A microscopical
examination of the hepatic cells showed them laden with fat
globules, especially in the central parts of the liver.</p>

<p>The microscopic appearances are also characteristic. In a case
of suicidal poisoning by phosphorus, in which death took place on the
seventh day, the liver was very carefully examined by Dr. G. F. Goodart,
who reported as follows:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>&#8220;Under a low power the structure of the liver is still readily recognisable, and in
this the specimen differs from slides of three cases of acute yellow atrophy that I
have in my possession. The hepatic cells are present in large numbers, and have
their natural trabecular arrangement. The columns are abnormally separated by
dilated blood or lymph-spaces, and the individual cells are cloudy and ill-defined.
The portal channels are everywhere characterised by a crowd of small nuclei which
stain with logwood deeply. The epithelium of the smaller ducts is cloudy, and
blocks the tubes in many cases. Under a high power (one-fifth) it is seen that the
hepatic cells are exceedingly ill-defined in outline, and full of granules and even
drops of oil. But in many parts, even where the cells themselves are hazy, the
nucleus is still fairly visible. It appears to me that, in opposition to what others
have described, the nuclei of the cells have in great measure resisted the degenerative
process. The change in the cells is uniform throughout each lobule, but some
lobules are rather more affected than others. The blood-spaces between the cells are
empty, and the liver appears to be very bloodless. The portal canals are uniformly
studded with small round nuclei or cells, which are in part, and might be said in
great part, due to increase of the connective tissue or to a cirrhotic process. But I
am more disposed to favour the view that they are due to migration from the blood-vessels,
because they are so uniform in size, and the hepatic cells and connective
tissue in their neighbourhood are undergoing no changes in the way of growth whatever.
I cannot detect any fatty changes in the vessels, but some of the smaller
biliary ducts contain some cloudy albuminous material, and their nucleation is not
distinct. No retained biliary pigment is visible.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor"><span class="fsize110">[309]</span></a></p>

cases attended with h&aelig;morrhage, the tubuli may be here and there
filled with blood. The fatty epithelium is especially seen in the contorted
tubes, and the walls of the vessels, both of the capsule and
of the malpighian bodies, also undergo the same fatty change. In cases
in which death has occurred rapidly, the kidneys have been found almost
healthy, or a little congested only. The pancreas has also been found
with its structure in part replaced by fatty elements.</p>

<p>Of great significance are also the fatty changes in the general muscular

heart quickly lose their transverse stri&aelig;, which are replaced by drops of
fat. Probably this change is the cause of the sudden death not unfrequently

<p><a name="Sect_295" id="Sect_295"></a>&sect; 295. <b>Diagnostic Differences between Acute Yellow Atrophy of
the Liver and Fatty Liver produced by Phosphorus.</b>&mdash;O. Schultzen
and O. L. Riess have collected and compared ten cases of fatty liver from
phosphorus poisoning, and four cases of acute yellow atrophy of the liver,
and, according to them, the chief points of distinction are as follows:&mdash;In
phosphorus poisoning the liver is large, doughy, equally yellow, and
with the acini well marked; while in acute yellow atrophy the liver is
diminished in size, tough, leathery, and of a dirty yellow hue, the acini
not being well mapped out. The &#8220;phosphorus&#8221; liver, again, presents
the cells filled with large fat drops, or entirely replaced by them; but in
the &#8220;atrophy&#8221; liver, the cells are replaced by a finely-nucleated detritus
and through newly-formed cellular tissue. Yellow atrophy seems to be
essentially an inflammation of the intralobular connective tissue, while in
phosphorus poisoning the cells become gorged by an infiltration of fat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
which presses upon the vessels and lessens the blood supply, and the
liver, in consequence, may, after a time, waste.</p>

<p>There is also a clinical distinction during life, not only in the lessening
bulk of the liver in yellow atrophy, in opposition to the increase of size
in the large phosphorus liver, but also in the composition of the renal
secretion. In yellow atrophy the urine contains so much leucine and
tyrosin, that the simple addition of acetic acid causes at once a precipitate.
Schultzen and Riess also found in the urine, in cases of yellow atrophy,
<i>oxymandelic acid</i> (<span class="chemform">C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>4</sub></span>), but in cases of phosphorus poisoning a nitrogenised
acid, fusing at 184&deg; to 185&deg;.</p>

<p>According to Maschka, grey-white, knotty, f&aelig;cal masses are found in
the intestines in yellow atrophy, but never in cases of phosphorus poisoning.
In the latter, it is more common to find a slight intestinal catarrh
and fluid excreta.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_296" id="Sect_296"></a>&sect; 296. <b>The Detection of Phosphorus</b>.&mdash;The following are the chief
methods in use for the separation and detection of phosphorus:<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a><span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_313" id="Footnote_313"></a><a href="#FNanchor_313"><span class="label">[313]</span></a> It has been recommended to dissolve the phosphorus out from
organic matters by carbon disulphide. On evaporation of the latter the
phosphorus is recognised by its physical properties. Such a method is of
but limited application, although it may sometimes be found useful. I
have successfully employed it in the extraction of phosphorus from the
crop of a fowl; but on this occasion it happened to be present in large
quantity.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>1. <b>Mitscherlich&#8217;s Process</b>.&mdash;The essential feature of this process is
simply distillation of free phosphorus, and observation of its luminous
properties as the vapour condenses in the condensing tube. The conditions
necessary for success are&mdash;(1) that the apparatus should be in total
darkness;<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> and (2) that there should be no substance present, such
as alcohol or ammonia,<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> which, distilling over with the phosphorus-vapour,
could destroy its luminosity. A convenient apparatus, and one
certain to be in all laboratories, is an ordinary Florence flask, containing
the liquid to be tested, fitted to a glass Liebig&#8217;s condenser, supported on
an iron sand-bath (which may, or may not, have a thin layer of sand), and
heated by a Fletcher&#8217;s low temperature burner. The distillate is received
into a flask. This apparatus, if in darkness, works well; but should the
observer wish to work in daylight, the condenser must be enclosed in
a box perfectly impervious to light, and having a hole through which
the luminosity of the tube may be seen, the head of the operator and the
box being covered with a cloth. If there be a stream of water passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
continuously through the condenser, a beautiful luminous ring of light
appears in the upper part of the tube, where it remains fixed for some
time. Should, however, the refrigeration be imperfect, the luminosity
travels slowly down the tube into the receiver. In any case, the delicacy
of the test is extraordinary.<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> If the organic liquid is alkaline, or
even neutral, there will certainly be some evolution of ammonia, which
will distil over before the phosphorus, and retard (or, if in sufficient
quantity, destroy) the luminosity. In such a case it is well, as a precaution,
to add enough sulphuric acid to fix the ammonia, omitting such
addition if the liquid to be operated upon is acid.</p>

<p>2.  <b>The Production of Phosphine</b> (<span class="chemform">PH<sub>3</sub></span>).&mdash;Any method which produces
phosphine (phosphuretted hydrogen), enabling that gas to be passed
through nitrate of silver solution, may be used for the detection of phosphorus.
Thus, Sonnenschein states that he has found phosphorus in
extraordinary small amount, mixed with various substances, by heating
with potash in a flask, and passing the phosphine into silver nitrate,
separating the excess of silver, and recognising the phosphoric acid by the
addition of molybdate of ammonia.<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>The usual way is, however, to produce phosphine by means of the
action on free phosphorus of nascent hydrogen evolved on dissolving
metallic zinc in dilute sulphuric acid. Phosphine is formed by the action
of nascent hydrogen on solid phosphorus, phosphorous acid, and hypophosphorous
acid; but no phosphine can be formed in this way by the
action of hydrogen on phosphoric acid.</p>

<p>Since it may happen that no free phosphorus is present, but yet the
first product (phosphorous acid) of its oxidation, the production of phosphine
becomes a necessary test to make on failure of Mitscherlich&#8217;s
test; if no result follows the proper application of the two processes, the
probability is that phosphorus has not been taken.</p>

<p>Blondlot and Dusart evolve hydrogen from zinc and dilute sulphuric
acid, and pass the gas into silver nitrate; if the gas is pure, there is
of course no reduction; the liquid to be tested is then added to the
hydrogen-generating liquid, and if phosphorous or hypophosphorous acids

prove that this black precipitate is neither that produced by <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>, nor by
antimony nor arsenic, the precipitate is collected and placed in the
apparatus to be presently described, and the spectroscopic appearances of
the phosphine flame observed.</p>

hydrogen flame, containing only a minute trace of phosphorus, or of the
lower products of its oxidation, acquires a beautiful green tint, and
possesses a characteristic <i>spectrum</i>. In order to obtain the latter in its
best form, the amount of phosphine must not be too large, or the flame
will become whitish and livid, and the bands lose their defined character,
rendering the spectrum continuous. Again, the orifice of the tube whence
the gas escapes must not be too small; and the best result is obtained
when the flame is cooled.</p>

<p>M. Salet has proposed two excellent methods for the observation of
phosphine by the spectroscope:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1)  He projects the phosphorus-flame on a plane vertical surface,
maintained constantly cold by means of a thin layer of running water;
the green colour is especially produced in the neighbourhood of the cool
surface.</p>

<p>(2)  At the level of the base of the flame, there is an annular space,
through which a stream of cold air is continually blown upwards. Thus
cooled, the light is very pronounced, and the band &#948;, which is almost
invisible in the ordinary method of examination, is plainly seen.<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>

has displaced the air, both tubes are lit, and the two flames, being side
by side, can be compared. Should any phosphorus come over from the
zinc (a possibility which the interposed silver nitrate ought to guard
against), it is detected; the last flask is now gently warmed, and if the
flame is green, or, indeed, in any case, it should be examined by the

orange and yellow between C and D, but very close to D, and several
bands in the green. But the bands &#948;, &#947;, &#945;, and &#946; are the most
characteristic. The band &#948; has its centre about the wave-length 599&middot;4;
it is easily distinguished when the slit of the spectroscope is a little
wide, but may be invisible if the slit is too narrow. It is best seen by
M. Salet&#8217;s second process, and, when cooled by a brisk current of air, it
broadens, and may extend closer to D. The band &#947; has a somewhat
decided border towards E, while it is nebulous towards D, and it is,
therefore, very difficult to say where it begins or where it ends; its
centre may, however, be put at very near 109 of Boisbaudran&#8217;s scale,
corresponding to W. L. 560&middot;5, if the flame is free. This band is more
distinct than &#946;, but with a strong current of air the reverse is the case.
The middle of the important band &#945; is nearly marked by Fraunhofer&#8217;s
line E. Boisbaudran gives it as coinciding with 122 of his scale W. L.
526&middot;3. In ordinary conditions (that is, with a free uncooled flame) this
is the brightest and most marked of all the bands. The approximate
middle of the band &#946; is W. L. 510&middot;6 (Boisbaudran&#8217;s scale 129&middot;00).</p>

<p><b>Lipowitz&#8217;s Sulphur Test.</b>&mdash;Sulphur has the peculiar property of
condensing phosphorus on its surface, and of this Lipowitz proposed to
take advantage. Pieces of sulphur are digested some time with the
liquid under research, subsequently removed, and slightly dried. When
examined in the dark, should phosphorus be present, they gleam strongly
if rubbed with the finger, and develop a phosphorus odour. The test is
wanting in delicacy, nor can it well be made quantitative; it has, however,
an advantage in certain cases, <i>e.g.</i>, the detection of phosphorus in
an alcoholic liquid.</p>

<p>Scherer&#8217;s test, as modified by Hager,<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> is a very delicate and almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
decisive test. The substances to be examined are placed in a flask with
a little lead acetate (to prevent the possibility of any hydric sulphide
being evolved), some ether added, and a strip of filter-paper soaked in a
solution of silver nitrate is then suspended in the flask; this is conveniently
done by making a slit in the bottom of the cork, and in the slit securing
the paper. The closed flask is placed in the dark, and if phosphorus is
present, in a few minutes there is a black stain. It may be objected that
arsine will cause a similar staining, but then arsine could hardly be developed
under the circumstances given. It is scarcely necessary to
observe that the paper must be wet.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_298" id="Sect_298"></a>&sect; 298. <b>Chemical Examination of the Urine.</b>&mdash;It may be desirable,
in any case of suspected phosphorus poisoning, to examine the renal
secretion for leucin and tyrosin, &amp;c. Leucin may be found as a deposit
in the urine. Its general appearance is that of little oval or round discs,
looking like drops of fat. It can be recognised by taking up one or more
of these little bodies and placing them in the author&#8217;s subliming cell (see
<a href="#Sect_314">&sect; 314</a>). By careful heating it will sublime wholly on to the upper cover.
On now adding a little nitric acid to the sublimed leucin, and drying,
and then to the dried residue adding a droplet of a solution of sodium
hydrate, leucin forms an oily drop. Tyrosin also may occur as a sediment
of little heaps of fine needles. The best test for tyrosin is to dissolve in
hot water, and then add a drop of a solution of mercuric nitrate and
mercurous nitrate, when a rose colour is at once developed, if the tyrosin
is in very minute quantity; but if in more than traces, there is a distinct
crimson precipitate. To separate leucin and tyrosin from the urine, the
best process is as follows:&mdash;The urine is filtered from any deposit,
evaporated to a thin syrup, and decanted from the second deposit that
forms. The two deposits are mixed together and treated with dilute
ammonia, which will dissolve out any tyrosin and leave it in needles, if
the ammonia is spontaneously evaporated on a watch-glass. The urine
is then diluted and treated with neutral and basic acetates of lead, filtered,
and the lead thrown out of the filtrate by hydric sulphide. The filtrate
is evaporated to a syrup, and it then deposits leucin mixed with some
tyrosin. If, however, the syrup refuses to crystallise, it is treated with
cold absolute alcohol, and filtered, the residue is then boiled up with
spirit of wine, which extracts leucin, and deposits it on cooling in a
crystalline form. To obtain oxymandelic acid, the mother liquor, from
which leucin and tyrosin have been extracted, is precipitated with
absolute alcohol, filtered, and then the alcoholic solution evaporated to a
syrup. This syrup is acidified by sulphuric acid, and extracted with
ether; the ether is filtered off and evaporated to dryness; the dry residue
will be in the form of oily drops and crystals. The crystals are collected,
dissolved in water, and the solution precipitated by lead acetate to remove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
colouring-matters; after filtration it is finally precipitated by basic acetate.
On decomposition of the basic acetate, by suspending in water and
saturating with hydric sulphide, the ultimate filtrate on evaporation
deposits colourless, flexible needles of oxymandelic acid. The nitrogenised
acid which Schultzen and Riess obtained from urine in a case of
phosphorus poisoning, was found in an alcohol and ether extract&mdash;warts
of rhombic scales separating out of the syrupy residue. These scales gave
no precipitate with basic acetate, but formed a compound with silver
nitrate. The silver compound was in the form of shining white needles,
and contained 33&middot;9 per cent. of silver; the acid was decomposed by heat,
and with lime yielded aniline. Its melting-point is given at from 184&deg;
to 185&deg;. The occurrence of some volatile substance in phosphorus urine,
which blackens nitrate of silver, and which is probably phosphine, was
first noticed by Selmi.<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> Pesci and Stroppa have confirmed Selmi&#8217;s
researches. It is even given off in the cold.</p>

atmosphere of <span class="chemform">CO<sub>2</sub></span> into a flask with water, to which a tube containing
silver nitrate is attached; the latter retains all phosphine, the former
solid phosphorus. If necessary, the distillate may be again distilled into

the stomach were diluted with water, a measured part filtered, and the
phosphoric acid estimated. The other portion was then oxidised by

difference being calculated as free phosphorus.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_300" id="Sect_300"></a>&sect; 300. <b>How long can Phosphorus be recognised after Death?</b>&mdash;One of
the most important matters for consideration is the time after death in which
free phosphorus, or free phosphoric acids, can be detected. Any phosphorus
changed into ammon. mag. phosphate, or into any other salt, is for
medico-legal purposes entirely lost, since the expert can only take cognisance
of the substance either in a free state, as phosphine, or as a free acid.</p>

<p>The question, again, may be asked in court&mdash;Does the decomposition
of animal substances rich in phosphorus develop phosphine? The answer
to this is, that no such reaction has been observed.</p>

<p>A case is related<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> in which phosphorus was recognised, although the

<h4>I.&mdash;General Methods of Testing and Extracting Alkaloids.</h4>

<p><a name="Sect_301" id="Sect_301"></a>&sect; 301. <b>General Tests for Alkaloids.</b>&mdash;In order to ascertain whether
an alkaloid is present or not, a method of extraction must be pursued
which, while disposing of fatty matters, salts, &amp;c., shall dissolve as little
as possible of foreign substances&mdash;such a method, <i>e.g.</i>, as the original
process of Stas, or one of its modern modifications.</p>

<p>If to the acid aqueous solution finally obtained by this method a dilute
solution of soda be added, drop by drop, until it is rendered feebly
alkaline, <i>and no precipitate appear</i>, whatever other poisonous plant-constituents
may be present, all ordinary alkaloids<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> are absent.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>In addition to this negative test, there are also a number of substances
which give well-marked crystalline or amorphous precipitates with
alkaloids.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_302" id="Sect_302"></a>&sect; 302. These may be called &#8220;group reagents.&#8221; The chief members of
the group-reagents are&mdash;Iodine dissolved in hydriodic acid, iodine dissolved
in potassic iodide solution, bromine dissolved in potassic bromide
solution, hydrargo-potassic iodide, bismuth-potassic iodide, cadmic potassic
iodide; the chlorides of gold, of platinum, and mercury; picric acid,
gallic acid, tannin, chromate of potash, bichromate of potash, phospho-molybdic
acid, phospho-tungstic acid, silico-tungstic acid, and Fr&ouml;hde&#8217;s
reagent. It will be useful to make a few general remarks on some of
these reagents.</p>

<p><b>Iodine in hydriodic acid</b> gives either crystalline or amorphous precipitates
with nearly all alkaloids; the compound with morphine, for
example, is in very definite needles; with dilute solutions of atropine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
the precipitate is in the form of minute dots, but the majority of the
precipitates are amorphous, and all are more or less coloured.</p>

<p><b>Iodine dissolved in a solution of potassic iodide</b> gives with alkaloids
a reddish or red-brown precipitate, and this in perhaps a greater dilution
than almost any reagent. When added to an aqueous solution, the precipitates
are amorphous, but if added to an alcoholic solution, certain
alkaloids then form crystalline precipitates; this, for example, is the case
with berberine and narceine. By treating the precipitate with aqueous
sulphurous acid, a sulphate of the alkaloid is formed and hydriodic acid,
so that by suitable operations the alkaloid may readily be recovered from
this compound. A solution of bromine in potassic bromide solution also
gives similar precipitates to the above, but it forms insoluble compounds
with phenol, orcin, and other substances.</p>

<p><b>Mercuric potassic iodide</b> is prepared by decomposing mercuric
chloride with potassic iodide in excess. The proportions are 13&middot;546 grms.
of mercuric chloride and 49&middot;8 of potassic iodide, and water sufficient to
measure, when dissolved, 1 litre. The precipitates from this reagent are
white and flocculent; many of them become, on standing, crystalline.</p>

<p><b>Bismuthic potassic iodide</b> in solution precipitates alkaloids, and the
compounds formed are of great insolubility, but it also forms compounds
with the various albuminoid bodies.</p>

<p><b>Chloride of gold</b> forms with the alkaloids compounds, many of which
are crystalline, and most admit of utilisation for quantitative determinations.
Chloride of gold does not precipitate amides or ammonium compounds,
and on this account its value is great. The precipitates are
yellow, and after a while are partly decomposed, when the colour is of a
reddish-brown.</p>

<p><b>Platinic chloride</b> also forms precipitates with most of the alkaloids,
but since it also precipitates ammonia and potassic salts, it is inferior to
gold chloride in utility.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_303" id="Sect_303"></a>&sect; 303. (1.) <b>Phosphomolybdic Acid as a Reagent for Alkaloids.</b>&mdash;<i>Preparation</i>;
Molybdate of ammonia is precipitated by phosphate of
soda; and the well-washed yellow precipitate is suspended in water and
warmed with carbonate of soda, until it is entirely dissolved. This solution
is evaporated to dryness, and the ammonia fully expelled by heating.
If the molybdic acid is fairly reduced by this means, it is to be
moistened by nitric acid, and the heating repeated. The now dry residue
is warmed with water, nitric acid added to strong acid reaction, and the
mixture diluted with water, so that 10 parts of the solution contain 1 of
the dry salt. The precipitates of the alkaloids are as follows:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(2.) <b>Silico-Tungstic Acid as a Reagent for Alkaloids.</b>&mdash;Sodium tungstate
is boiled with freshly precipitated gelatinous silica. To the solution is
added mercurous nitrate, which precipitates the yellow mercurous silico-tungstate.
This is filtered, well-washed, and decomposed by an equivalent
quantity of hydrochloric acid; silico-tungstic acid then goes into
solution, and mercurous chloride (calomel) remains behind. The clear
filtrate is evaporated to drive off the excess of hydrochloric acid, and
furnishes, on spontaneous evaporation, large, shining, colourless octahedra
of silico-tungstic acid, which effloresce in the air, melt at 36&deg;, and are
easily soluble in water or alcohol.</p>

<p>This agent produces no insoluble precipitate with any metallic salt.
C&aelig;sium and rubidium salts, even in dilute solutions, are precipitated by
it; neutral solutions of ammonium chloride give with it a white precipitate,
soluble with difficulty in large quantities of water. It precipitates
solutions of the salts of quinine, cinchonine, morphine, atropine, &amp;c.; if
in extremely dilute solution, an opalescence only is produced: for instance,
it has been observed that cinchonine hydrochlorate in <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>200000</sub>, quinia

<p><a name="Sect_305" id="Sect_305"></a>&sect; 305. <b>Dragendorff&#8217;s reagent</b> is a solution of potass-bismuth iodide;
it is prepared by dissolving bismuth iodide in a hot solution of potassium
iodide, and then diluting with an equal volume of iodide of potassium
solution. On the addition of an acid solution of an alkaloid, a kermes-red
precipitate falls down, which is in many cases crystalline.</p>

<p><b>Marm&#8217;s reagent</b> is a solution of potass-cadmium iodide. It is made
on similar principles.</p>

<p><b>Potass-zinc iodide</b> in solution is also made similarly. The precipitates
produced in solutions of narceine and codeine are crystalline and very
characteristic.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_306" id="Sect_306"></a>&sect; 306. <b>Colour Tests.</b>&mdash;<b>Fr&ouml;hde&#8217;s reagent</b> is made by dissolving 1 part
of sodic molybdate in 10 parts of strong sulphuric acid; it strikes
distinctive colours with many alkaloids.</p>

<p><b>Mandelin&#8217;s reagent</b> is a solution of meta-vanadate of ammonia in
mono- or dihydrated sulphuric acid. The strength should be 1 part of
the salt to 200 of the acid. This reagent strikes a colour with many
alkaloids, and aids to their identification. It is specially useful to
supplement and correct other tests. The following table gives the chief
colour reactions, with the alkaloids. (See also <a href="#Page_55">p. 55</a> for the spectroscopic
appearances of certain of the colour tests.)</p>

<h5>METHODS OF SEPARATION.</h5>

<p><a name="Sect_307" id="Sect_307"></a>&sect; 307. <b>Stas&#8217;s Process.</b>&mdash;The original method of Stas<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> (afterwards
modified by Otto)<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> consisted in extraction of the organic matters by
strong alcohol, with the addition of tartaric acid; the filtered solution
was then carefully neutralised with soda, and shaken up with ether, the
ethereal solution being separated by a pipette. Subsequent chemists
proposed chloroform instead of ether,<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> the additional use of amyl-alcohol,<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>
and the substitution of acetic, hydrochloric, and sulphuric
for tartaric acid.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_308" id="Sect_308"></a>&sect; 308. <b>Selmi&#8217;s Process for Separating Alkaloids.</b>&mdash;A method of
separating alkaloids from an ethereal solution has been proposed by
Selmi.<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> The alcoholic extract of the viscera, acidified and filtered, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
evaporated at 65&deg;; the residue taken up with water, filtered, and
decolorised by basic acetate of lead. The lead is thrown out by
sulphuretted hydrogen; the solution, after concentration, repeatedly
extracted with ether; and the ethereal solution saturated with dry
<span class="chemform">CO<sub>2</sub></span>, which generally precipitates some of the alkaloids. The ethereal
solution is then poured into clean vessels, and mixed with about half
its volume of water, through which a current of <span class="chemform">CO<sub>2</sub></span> is passed for twenty
minutes; this may cause the precipitation of other alkaloids not thrown
down by dry <span class="chemform">CO<sub>2</sub></span>. If the whole of the alkaloids are not obtained by
these means, the solution is dehydrated by agitation with barium oxide,
and a solution of tartaric acid in ether is added (care being taken to
avoid excess); this throws down any alkaloid still present. The detection
of any yet remaining in the viscera is effected by mixing with
barium hydrate and a little water, and agitating with <i>purified</i> amylic
alcohol; from the alcohol the alkaloids may be subsequently extracted
by agitation with very dilute sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>Another ingenious method (also the suggestion of Selmi) is to treat
the organic substance with alcohol, to which a little sulphuric acid has
been added, to filter, digest with alcohol, and refilter. The filtrates are
united, evaporated down to a smaller bulk, filtered, concentrated to a
syrup, alkalised by barium hydrate, and, after the addition of freshly
ignited barium oxide and some powdered glass, exhausted with dry
ether; the ether filtered, the filtrate digested with lead hydrate; the
ethereal solution filtered, evaporated to dryness, and finally again taken
up with ether, which, this time, should leave on evaporation the alkaloid
almost pure.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_309" id="Sect_309"></a>&sect; 309. <b>Dragendorff&#8217;s Process.</b>&mdash;To Dragendorff we owe an elaborate
general method of separation, since it is applicable not only to alkaloids,
but to glucosides, and other active principles derived from plants. His
process is essentially a combination of those already known, and its distinctive
features are the shaking up&mdash;(1) of the acid fluid with the
solvent, thus removing colouring matters and certain non-alkaloidal
principles; and (2) of the same fluid made alkaline. The following is
his method in full. It may be advantageously used when the analyst
has to search generally for vegetable poison, although it is, of course, far
too elaborate for every case; and where, from any circumstance, there is
good ground for suspecting the presence of one or two particular alkaloids
or poisons, the process may be much shortened and modified.<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

<p>I. The substance, in as finely-divided form as possible, is digested for
a few hours in water acidified with sulphuric acid, at a temperature of

This treatment (if the temperature mentioned is not exceeded) does not
decompose the majority of alkaloids or other active substances; but there
are a few (<i>e.g.</i>, solanine and colchicine) which would be altered by it;
and, if such are suspected, maceration at the common temperature is
necessary, with substitution of acetic for sulphuric acid.<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>II. The extract is next evaporated until it begins to be of a syrupy
consistence; the residue mixed with three to four times its volume of
alcohol, macerated for twenty-four hours at about 34&deg;, allowed to become
quite cool, and filtered from the foreign matters which have separated.
The residue is washed with alcohol of 70 per cent.</p>

<p>III. The filtrate is freed from alcohol by distillation, the watery residue
poured into a capacious flask, diluted (if necessary) with water, and
filtered. Acid as it is, it is extracted at the common temperature, with
frequent shaking, by freshly-rectified petroleum ether; and, after the
fluids have again separated, the petroleum ether is removed, carrying
with it certain impurities (colouring matter, &amp;c.), which are in this way
advantageously displaced. By this operation ethereal oils, carbolic acid,
picric acid, &amp;c., which have not been distilled, besides piperin, may also
be separated. The shaking up with petroleum ether is repeated several
times (as long as anything remains to be dissolved), and the products are
evaporated on several watch-glasses.</p>

<p class="center">VI. THE WATERY FLUID IS NOW AGAIN SHAKEN UP WITH
PETROLEUM ETHER,</p>

<p>in order to take up the rest of the chloroform, and the watery fluid is
saturated with ammonia. The watery solution of <i>aconitine</i> and <i>emetine</i>
is liable to undergo, through free ammonia, a partial decomposition;
but, on the other hand, it is quite possible to obtain, with very small
mixtures of the substances, satisfactory reactions, even out of ammoniacal
solutions.</p>

<p class="center">VII. THE AMMONIACAL WATERY FLUID WITH
PETROLEUM ETHER.</p>

<p>In the earlier stages Dragendorff advises the shaking up with petroleum
ether at about 40&deg;, and the removal of the ether as quickly as
possible whilst warm. This is with the intention of separating by this fluid
strychnine, brucine, emetine, quinine, veratrine, &amp;c. Finding, however,
that a full extraction by petroleum ether is either difficult or not practicable,
he prefers, as we have seen, to conclude the operation by other agents,
coming back again upon the ether for certain special cases. Such are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
volatile alkaloids; and here he recommends treatment of the fluid by <i>cold</i>
petroleum ether, taking care <i>not</i> to hasten the removal of the latter.
Strychnine and other fixed alkaloids are then only taken up in small
quantities, and the greater portion remains for the later treatment of the
watery fluid by benzene.</p>

<p>A portion of the petroleum ether, supposed to contain in solution
volatile alkaloids, is evaporated in two watch-glasses; to the one, strong
hydrochloric acid is added, the other being evaporated without this agent.
On the evaporation of the petroleum ether, it is seen whether the first
portion is crystalline or amorphous, or whether the second leaves behind
a strongly-smelling fluid mass, which denotes a volatile alkaloid. If the
residue in both glasses is without odour and fixed, the absence of volatile
acids and the presence of fixed alkaloids, strychnine, emetine, veratrine,
&amp;c., are indicated.</p>

<p class="center">VIII. THE AMMONIACAL SOLUTION IS SHAKEN UP WITH
BENZENE.</p>

<p>In most cases petroleum ether, benzene, and chloroform are more
easily separated from acid watery fluids than from ammoniacal, benzene
and chloroform causing here a difficulty which has perhaps deterred
many from using this method. Dragendorff, however, maintains that
he has never examined a fluid in which he could not obtain a complete
separation of the benzene and water. If the upper benzene layer is fully
gelatinous and emulsive, the under layer of water is to be removed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
a pipette as far as possible, and the benzene with a few drops of absolute
alcohol and filtration. As a rule, the water goes through first alone, and
by the time the greater part has run through, the jelly in the filter, by
dint of stirring, has become separated from the benzene, and, finally, the
jelly shrinks up to a minimum, and the clear benzene filters off. Dragendorff
filters mostly into a burette, from which ultimately the benzene and
the water are separated.</p>

<p>The principal alkaloids which are dissolved in benzene are&mdash;strychnine,
methyl and ethyl strychnine, brucine, emetine, quinine, cinchonine,
atropine, hyoscyamine, physostigmine, aconitine, nepalin, the alkaloid
of the <i>Aconitum lycoctonum</i>, aconellin, napellin, delphinine, veratrine,
sabatrin, sabadilline, codeine, thebaine, and narcotine.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Shorter Process for Separating some of the Alkaloids.</span></h5>

<p><a name="Sect_310" id="Sect_310"></a>&sect; 310. A shorter process, recommended conditionally by Dragendorff,
for brucine, strychnine, quinine, cinchonine, and emetine, is as follows:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The substance, if necessary, is finely divided, and treated with
sulphuric acid (dilute) until it has a marked acid reaction. To every
100 c.c. of the pulp (which has been diluted with distilled water to
admit of its being filtered later), at least 5 to 10 c.c. of diluted sulphuric
acid (1&nbsp;: 5) are added. It is digested at 50&deg; for a few hours, filtered, and
the residue treated again with 100 c.c. of water at 50&deg;. This extract is,
after a few hours, again filtered; both the filtrates are mixed and
evaporated in the water-bath to almost the consistency of a thin syrup.
The fluid, however, must not be concentrated too much, or fully evaporated
to dryness. The residue is now placed in a flask, and treated with
three to four times its volume of alcohol of 90 to 95 per cent.; the
mixture is macerated for twenty-four hours, and then filtered. The
filtrate is distilled alcohol-free, or nearly so, but a small amount of
alcohol remaining is not objectionable. The watery fluid is diluted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
about 50 c.c., and treated with pure benzene; the mixture is shaken, and
after a little time the benzene removed&mdash;an operation which is repeated.
After the removal the second time of the benzene, the watery fluid is
made alkaline with ammonia, warmed to 40&deg; or 50&deg;, and the free
alkaloid extracted by twice shaking it up with two different applications
of benzene. On evaporation of the latter, if the alkaloid is not left pure,
it can be dissolved in acid, precipitated by ammonia, and again extracted
by benzene.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_311" id="Sect_311"></a>&sect; 311. <b>Scheibler&#8217;s Process</b>.&mdash;A method very different from those just described is
one practised by Scheibler. This is to precipitate the phosphotungstate of the
alkaloid, and then to liberate the latter by digesting the precipitate with either
hydrate of barium or hydrate of calcium, dissolving it out by chloroform, or, if
volatile, by simple distillation. The convenience of Scheibler&#8217;s process is great, and
it admits of very general application. In complex mixtures, it will usually be found
best to precede the addition of phosphotungstic acid<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> by that of acetate of lead, in
order to remove colouring matter, &amp;c.; the excess of lead must in its turn be thrown
out by <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>, and the excess of <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span> be got rid of by evaporation. Phosphotungstic
acid is a very delicate test for the alkaloids, giving a distinct precipitate with the
most minute quantities (<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>200000</sub> of strychnine and <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>100000</sub> of quinine). A very
similar method is practised by Sonnenschein and others with the aid of phospho-molybdic
acid. The details of Scheibler&#8217;s process are as follows:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

To the filtered fluid phosphotungstic acid is added in excess, the precipitate filtered,
washed with water to which some phosphotungstic acid solution has been added,
and, whilst still moist, rinsed into a flask. Caustic baryta or carbonate of potash is
added to alkaline reaction, and after the flask has been connected with bulbs containing
<span class="chemform">HCl</span>, it is heated at first slowly, then more strongly. Ammonia and any
volatile alkaloids are driven over into the acid, and are there fixed, and can be
examined later by suitable methods. The residue in the flask is carefully evaporated
to dryness (the excess of baryta having been precipitated by <span class="chemform">CO<sub>2</sub></span>), and then extracted

<p><a name="Sect_313" id="Sect_313"></a>&sect; 313. <b>Identification of the Alkaloids</b>.&mdash;Having obtained, in one way or other, a
crystalline or amorphous substance, supposed to be an alkaloid, or, at all events, an
active vegetable principle, the next step is to identify it. If the tests given in
Dragendorff&#8217;s process have been applied, the observer will have already gone a good
way towards the identification of the substance; but it is, of course, dangerous to
trust to one reaction.</p>

<p>In medico-legal researches there is seldom any considerable quantity of the material
to work upon. Hence the greatest care must be taken from the commencement not
to waste the substance in useless tests, but to study well at the outset what&mdash;by the
method of extraction used, the microscopic appearance, the reaction to litmus paper,
and the solubility in different menstrua&mdash;it is likely to be. However minute the
quantity may be, it is essential to divide it into different parts, in order to apply a
variety of tests; but as any attempt to do this on the solid substance will probably
entail loss, the best way is to dissolve it in a watch-glass in half a c.c. of alcohol,
ether, or other suitable solvent. Droplets of this solution are then placed on watch-glasses
or slips of microscopic glass, and to these drops, by the aid of a glass rod,
different reagents can be applied, and the changes watched under the microscope as
the drops slowly evaporate.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_314" id="Sect_314"></a>&sect; 314. <b>Sublimation of the Alkaloids.</b>&mdash;A very beautiful and elegant
aid to the identification of alkaloids, and vegetable principles generally,
is their behaviour towards heat.</p>

<p>Alkaloids, glucosides, the organic acids, &amp;c., when carefully heated,
either&mdash;(1) sublime wholly without decomposition (like theine, cytisin,
and others); or (2) partially sublime with decomposition; or (3) are
changed into new bodies (as, for example, gallic acid); or (4) melt and
then char; or (5) simply char and burn away.</p>

<p>Many of these phenomena are striking and characteristic, taking place
at different temperatures, subliming in characteristic forms, or leaving
characteristic residues.</p>

<p>One of the first to employ sublimation systematically, as a means of
recognition of the alkaloids, &amp;c., was Helwig.<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> His method was to place
a small quantity (from <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4000</sub> of a mgrm.) in a depression on
platinum foil, cover it with a slip of glass, and then carefully heat by a
small flame. After Helwig, Dr. Guy<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> greatly improved the process by
using porcelain discs, and more especially by the adoption of a convenient
apparatus, which may be termed &#8220;the subliming cell.&#8221; It is essentially
composed of a ring of glass from <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> to <sup>2</sup>&#8260;<sub>3</sub> of an inch in thickness, such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
may be obtained by sections of tubing, the cut surfaces being ground
perfectly smooth. This circle is converted into a closed cell by resting
it on one of the ordinary thin discs of glass used as a covering for microscopic
purposes, and supporting a similar disc. The cell was placed on
a brass plate, provided with a nipple, which carried a thermometer, and
was heated by a small flame applied midway between the thermometer
and the cell; the heat was raised very gradually, and the temperature at
which any change took place was noted. In this way Dr. Guy made
determinations of the subliming points of a large number of substances,
and the microscopic appearances of the sublimates were described with
the greatest fidelity and accuracy. On repeating with care Dr. Guy&#8217;s
determinations, however, I could in no single instance agree with his
subliming points, nor with the apparatus he figures and describes could
two consecutive observations exactly coincide. Further, on examining
the various subliming temperatures of substances, as stated by different
authors, the widest discrepancies were found&mdash;differences of 2 or even
3 degrees might be referred to errors of observation, a want of exact
coincidence in the thermometers employed, and the like; but to what,
for example, can we ascribe the irreconcilable statements which have
been made with regard to theine? According to Strauch, this substance
sublimes at 177&deg;; according to Mulder, at 184&middot;7&deg;. But that both of
these observations deviate more than 70&deg; from the truth may be proved
by any one who cares to place a few mgrms. of theine, enclosed between
two watch-glasses, over the water-bath; in a few minutes a distinct
sublimate will condense on the upper glass, and, in point of fact, theine
will be found to sublime several degrees below 100&deg;.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>Since this great divergency of opinion is not found either in the specific
gravity, or the boiling-points, or any of the like determinations of the
physical properties of a substance, it is self-evident that the processes
hitherto used for the determination of subliming points are faulty. The
sources of error are chiefly<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1.) Defects in the apparatus employed&mdash;the temperature read being
rather that of the metallic surface in the immediate vicinity of the
thermometer than of the substance itself.</p>

<p>(2.) The want of agreement among observers as to what should be
called a sublimate&mdash;one considering a sublimate only that which is evident
to the naked eye, another taking cognisance of the earliest microscopic
film.</p>

<p>(3.) No two persons employing the same process.</p>

<p>With regard to the apparatus employed, I adopt Dr. Guy&#8217;s subliming
cell; but the cell, instead of resting on a metallic solid, floats on a metallic
fluid. For any temperature a little above 100&deg; this fluid is mercury, but
for higher temperatures fusible metal is preferable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig293" id="Fig293"></a>
<img src="images/illo293.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="384" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Subliming Cell</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>The exact procedure is as follows:&mdash;A porcelain crucible (<i>a</i> in <a href="#Fig293">fig.</a>),
about 3 inches in diameter, is nearly filled with mercury or fusible
metal, as the case may be; a minute speck (or two or three crystals of
the substance to be examined) is placed on a thin disc of microscopic
covering glass, floated on the liquid, and the
cell is completed by the glass ring and upper
disc. The porcelain crucible is supported on a
brass plate (<i>b</i>), fixed to a retort-stand in the
usual way, and protected from the unequal
cooling effects of currents of air by being
covered by a flask (<i>c</i>), from which the bottom
has been removed. The neck of the flask conveniently
supports a thermometer, which passes
through a cork, and the bulb of the thermometer
is immersed in the bath of liquid metal. In
the first examination of a substance the temperature
is raised somewhat rapidly, taking off
the upper disc with a forceps at every 10&deg; and
exchanging it for a fresh disc, until the substance
is destroyed. The second examination
is conducted much more slowly, and the discs
exchanged at every 4&deg; or 5&deg;, whilst the final
determination is effected by raising the temperature with great caution,
and exchanging the discs at about the points of change (already partially
determined) at every half degree. All the discs are examined microscopically.
The most convenient definition of a sublimate is this&mdash;the
most minute films, dots, or crystals, which can be observed by <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>-inch
power, and which are obtained by keeping the subliming cell at a definite
temperature for 60 seconds. The commencement of many sublimates
assumes the shape of dots of extraordinary minuteness, quite invisible to
the unaided eye; and, on the other hand, since the practical value of
sublimation is mainly as an aid to other methods for the recognition of
substances, if we go beyond <i>short</i> intervals of time, the operation,
otherwise simple and speedy, becomes cumbersome, and loses its general
applicability.</p>

<p>There is also considerable discrepancy of statement with regard to the
melting-point of alkaloidal bodies; in many instances a viscous state
intervenes before the final complete resolution into fluid, and one
observer will consider the viscous state, the other complete fluidity, as
the melting-point.</p>

<p>In the melting-points given below, the same apparatus was used, but
the substance was simply placed on a thin disc of glass floating on the
metallic bath before described (the cell not being completed), and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
examined from time to time microscopically, for by this means alone can
the first drops formed by the most minute and closely-adherent crystals
to the glass be discovered.</p>

<p><b>Cocaine</b> melts at 93&deg;, and gives a faint sublimate at 98&deg;; if put
between two watch-glasses on the water-bath, in fifteen minutes there is
a good cloud on the upper glass.</p>

<p><b>Aconitine</b> turns brown, and melts at 179&deg; C.; it gives no characteristic
sublimate up to 190&deg;.</p>

<p><b>Morphine</b>, at 150&deg;, clouds the upper disc with nebul&aelig;; the nebul&aelig;
are resolved by high magnifying powers into minute dots; these dots
gradually become coarser, and are generally converted into crystals at
188&deg;; the alkaloid browns at or about 200&deg;.</p>

<p><b>Thebaine</b> sublimes in theine-like crystals at 135&deg;; at higher temperatures
(160&deg; to 200&deg;), needles, cubes, and prisms are observed. The
residue on the lower disc, if examined before carbonisation, is fawn-coloured
with non-characteristic spots.</p>

<p><b>Narcotine</b> gives no sublimate; it melts at 155&deg; into a yellow liquid,
which, on raising the temperature, ever becomes browner to final blackness.
On examining the residue before carbonisation, it is a rich brown
amorphous substance; but if narcotine be heated two or three degrees
above its melting-point, and then cooled slowly, the residue is crystalline&mdash;long,
fine needles radiating from centres being common.</p>

<p><b>Narceine</b> gives no sublimate; it melts at 134&deg; into a colourless liquid,
which undergoes at higher temperatures the usual transition of brown
colours. The substance, heated a few degrees above its melting-point,
and then allowed to cool slowly, shows a straw-coloured residue, divided
into lobes or drops containing feathery crystals.</p>

<p><b>Papaverine</b> gives no sublimate; it melts at 130&deg;. The residue, heated
a little above its melting-point, and then slowly cooled, is amorphous, of
a light-brown colour, and in no way characteristic.</p>

<p><b>Hyoscyamine</b> gives no crystalline sublimate; it melts at 89&deg;, and
appears to volatilise in great part without decomposition. It melts into
an almost colourless fluid, which, when solid, may exhibit a network not
unlike vegetable parenchyma; on moistening the network with water,
interlacing crystals immediately appear. If, however, hyoscyamine be
kept at 94&deg; to 95&deg; for a few minutes, and then slowly cooled, the edges
of the spots are arborescent, and the spots themselves crystalline.</p>

<p><b>Atropine</b> (daturine) melts at 97&deg;; at 123&deg; a faint mist appears on the
upper disc. Crystals cannot be obtained; the residue is not characteristic.</p>

<p><b>Solanine.</b>&mdash;The upper disc is dimmed with nebul&aelig; at 190&deg;, which are
coarser and more distinct at higher temperatures; at 200&deg; it begins to
brown, and then melts; the residue consists of amber-brown, non-characteristic
drops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Strychnine</b> gives a minute sublimate of fine needles, often disposed in
lines, at 169&deg;; about 221&deg; it melts, the residue (at that temperature) is
resinous.</p>

<p><b>Brucine</b> melts at 151&deg; into a pale yellow liquid, at higher temperatures
becoming deep-brown. If the lower disc, after melting, be examined, no
crystals are observed, the residue being quite transparent, with branching
lines like the twigs of a leafless tree; light mists, produced rather by
decomposition than by true sublimation, condense on the upper disc at
185&deg;, and above.</p>

<p><b>Saponin</b> neither melts nor sublimes; it begins to brown about 145&deg;,
is almost black at 185&deg;, and quite so at 190&deg;.</p>

<p><b>Delphinine</b> begins to brown about 102&deg;; it becomes amber at 119&deg;,
and melts, and bubbles appear. There is no crystalline sublimate;
residue not characteristic.</p>

<p><b>Pilocarpine</b> gives a distinct crystalline sublimate at 153&deg;; but thin
mists, consisting of fine dots, may be observed as low as 140&deg;. Pilocarpine
melts at 159&deg;; the sublimates at 160&deg; to 170&deg; are in light yellow
drops. If these drops are treated with water, and the water evaporated,
feathery crystals are obtained; the residue is resinous.</p>

<p><b>Theine</b> wholly sublimes; the first sublimate is minute dots, at 79&deg;;
at half a degree above that very small crystals may be obtained; and at
such a temperature as 120&deg;, the crystals are often long and silky.</p>

<p><b>Theobromine</b> likewise wholly sublimes; nebul&aelig; at 134&deg;, crystals at
170&deg;, and above.</p>

<p><b>Salicin</b> melts at 170&deg;; it gives no crystalline sublimate. The melted
mass remains up to 180&deg; almost perfectly colourless; above that temperature
browning is evident. The residue is not characteristic.</p>

<p><b>Picrotoxin</b> gives no crystalline sublimate. The lowest temperature at
which it sublimes is 128&deg;; the usual nebul&aelig; then make their appearance;
between 165&deg; and 170&deg; there is slight browning; at 170&deg; it melts.
The residue, slowly cooled, is not characteristic.</p>

<p><b>Cantharidin</b> sublimes very scantily between 82&deg; and 83&deg;; at 85&deg; the
sublimate is copious.</p>

determines the melting-point; such a determination will, however,
seldom compare with the melting-points of the various alkaloids as
given in text-books, because the latter melting-points are not determined
in the same way. The usual method of determining melting-points
is to place a very small quantity in a glass tube closed at one
end; the tube should be almost capillary. The tube is fastened to a
thermometer by means of platinum wire, and then the bulb of the
thermometer, with its attached tube, is immersed in strong sulphuric
acid or paraffin, contained in a flask. The thermometer should be
suspended midway in the liquid and heat carefully applied, so as to
raise the temperature gradually and equably. It will be found that
rapidly raising the heat gives a different melting-point to that which
is obtained by slowly raising the heat. During the process careful
watching is necessary: most substances change in hue before they
actually melt. A constant melting-point, however often a substance
is purified by recrystallisation, is a sign of purity.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_316" id="Sect_316"></a>&sect; 316. <b>Identification by Organic Analysis.</b>&mdash;In a few cases (and in
a few only) the analyst may have sufficient material at hand to make an
organic analysis, either as a means of identification or to confirm other
tests. By the vacuum process described in &#8220;Foods,&#8221; in which carbon
and nitrogen are determined by measuring the gases evolved by burning
the organic substance in as complete a vacuum as can be obtained, very
minute quantities of a substance can be dealt with, and the carbon and
nitrogen determined with fair accuracy. It is found in practice that
the carbon determinations appear more reliable than those of the nitrogen,
and there are obvious reasons why this should be so.</p>

<p>Theoretically, with the improved gas-measuring appliances, it is possible
to measure a c.c. of gas; but few chemists would care to create a formula
on less than 10 c.c. of <span class="chemform">CO<sub>2</sub></span>. Now, since 10 c.c. of <span class="chemform">CO<sub>2</sub></span> is equal to 6&middot;33
mgrms. of carbon, and alkaloids average at least half their weight of
carbon, it follows that 12 mgrms. of alkaloid represent about the smallest
quantity with which a reliable single combustion can be made.</p>

<p>The following table gives a considerable number of the alkaloids and
alkaloidal bodies, arranged according to their content in carbon:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The final reaction is found by filtering, from time to time, a drop on to a
glass plate, resting on a blackened surface, and adding the test until no
precipitate appears. The results are only accurate when the strength of
the solution of the alkaloid is about 1&nbsp;: 200; so that it is absolutely
necessary first to ascertain approximatively the amount present, and then
to dilute or concentrate, as the case may be, until the proportion mentioned
is obtained.</p>

<p>A convenient method of obtaining the sulphate of an alkaloid for
quantitative purposes, and especially from organic fluids, is that recommended
by Wagner. The fluid is acidulated with sulphuric acid, and
the alkaloid precipitated by a solution of iodine in iodide of potassium.
The precipitate is collected and dissolved in an aqueous solution of hyposulphite
of soda. The filtered solution is again precipitated with the
iodine reagent, and the precipitate dissolved in sulphurous acid, which,
on evaporation, leaves behind the pure sulphate of the base.</p>

<p>It is also very useful for quantitative purposes to combine an alkaloid
with gold or platinum, by treating the solution with the chlorides of
either of those metals&mdash;the rule as to selection being to give that metal
the preference which yields the most insoluble and the most crystallisable
compound.</p>

ignition of the double salt:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="center">THE ALKALOIDS OF HEMLOCK&mdash;NICOTINE&mdash;PITURIE&mdash;SPARTEINE.</p>

<h5>1. THE ALKALOIDS OF HEMLOCK (CONIUM).</h5>

<p><a name="Sect_318" id="Sect_318"></a>&sect; 318. The <i>Conium maculatum</i>, or spotted hemlock, is a rather common
umbelliferous plant, growing in waste places, and flowering from about
the beginning of June to August. The stem is from three to five feet
high, smooth, branched, and spotted with purple; the leaflets of the
partial involucres are unilateral, ovate, lanceolate, with an attenuate point
shorter than the umbels; the seeds are destitute of vitt&aelig;, and have five
prominent crenate wavy ridges. The whole plant is f&#339;tid and poisonous.
Conium owes its active properties to a volatile liquid alkaloid, <i>Coniine</i>,
united with a crystalline alkaloid, <i>Conhydrine</i>.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_319" id="Sect_319"></a>&sect; 319. <b>Coniine</b> (<b>conia</b>, <b>conicine</b>), (<span class="chemform">C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>17</sub>N</span>)&mdash;specific gravity 0&middot;862 at
0&deg;; melting-point, -2&middot;5&deg;; boiling-point, 166&middot;6&deg;. Pure coniine has been
prepared synthetically by Ladenburg, and found to be propyl-piperidine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
<span class="chemform">C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>10</sub>NC<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub></span>, but the synthetically-prepared piperidine has no action on
polarised light. By uniting it with dextro-tartaric acid, and evaporating,
it is possible to separate the substance into dextro-propyl-piperidine and
l&aelig;vo-propyl-piperidine. The former is in every respect identical with
coniine from hemlock; it is a clear, oily fluid, possessing a peculiarly
unpleasant, mousey odour. One part is soluble in 150 parts of water,<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>
in 6 parts of ether, and in almost all proportions of amyl alcohol, chloroform,
and benzene. It readily volatilises, and, provided air is excluded,
may be distilled unchanged. It ignites easily, and burns with a smoky
flame. It acts as a strong base, precipitating the oxides of metals and
alkaline earths from their solutions, and it coagulates albumen. Coniine
forms salts with hydrochloric acid (<span class="chemform">C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>15</sub>N.HCl</span>), phosphoric acid, iodic
acid, and oxalic acid, which are in well-marked crystals. The sulphate,
nitrate, acetate, and tartrate are, on the other hand, non-crystalline.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_341" id="Footnote_341"></a><a href="#FNanchor_341"><span class="label">[341]</span></a> The saturated watery solution of coniine at 15&deg;, becomes cloudy if
gently warmed, and clears again on cooling.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>If coniine is oxidised with nitric acid, or bichromate of potash, and
diluted sulphuric acid, butyric acid is formed; and since the latter has
an unmistakable odour, and other characteristic properties, it has been
proposed as a test for coniine. This may be conveniently performed
thus:&mdash;A crystal of potassic bichromate is put at the bottom of a test-tube,
and some diluted sulphuric acid with a drop of the supposed
coniine added. On heating, the butyric acid reveals itself by its odour,
and can be distilled into baryta water, the butyrate of baryta being
subsequently separated in the usual way, and decomposed by sulphuric
acid, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Another test for coniine is the following:&mdash;If dropped into a solution
of alloxan, the latter is coloured after a few minutes an intense purple-red,
and white needle-shaped crystals are separated, which dissolve in
cold potash-lye into a beautiful purple-blue, and emit an odour of the
base.<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> Dry hydrochloric acid gives a purple-red, then an indigo-blue
colour, with coniine; but if the acid is not dry, there is formed a bluish-green
crystalline mass. This test, however, is of little value to the
toxicologist, the pure substance alone responding with any definite result.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>Phosphomolybdic acid gives a strong yellow precipitate; limit,
1&nbsp;: 5000.</p>

<p>Potass. mercuric iodide gives a cheesy precipitate; limit, 1&nbsp;: 1000 in
neutral, 1&nbsp;: 800 in acid, solutions.</p>

<p>Potass. cadmic iodide gives an amorphous precipitate, 1&nbsp;: 300. The
precipitate is soluble in excess of the precipitant. (Nicotine, under
similar circumstances, gives a crystalline precipitate.)</p>

<p>Fl&uuml;ckiger recommends the following reaction:<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>&mdash;&#8220;Add to 10 drops of
ether in a shallow glass crystallising dish 2 drops of coniine, and cover
with filter paper. Set upon the paper a common-sized watch-glass
containing bromine water, and invert a beaker over the whole arrangement.
Needle-shaped crystals of coniine hydro-bromine soon form in
the dish as well as in the watch-glass.&#8221; Hydrochloric acid, used in the
same way, instead of bromine water, forms with coniine microscopic
needles of coniine hydrochlorate; both the hydro-bromide and the hydrochlorate
doubly refract light. Nicotine does not respond to this
reaction.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>Coniine forms with carbon disulphide a thiosulphate and a sulphite.
If carbon disulphide, therefore, be shaken with an aqueous solution of
coniine, the watery solution gives a brown precipitate with copper sulphate,
colours ferric chloride solution dark brown red, and gives a milky
opalescence with dilute acids. If coniine itself is added to carbon
disulphide, there is evolution of heat, separation of sulphur, and formation
of thiosulphate. Nicotine does not respond to this reaction.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_320" id="Sect_320"></a>&sect; 320. <b>Other Coniine Bases.</b>&mdash;Methyl- and ethyl-coniine have been
prepared synthetically, and are both similar in action to coniine, but
somewhat more like curarine. By the reduction of coniine with zinc
dust conyrine (<span class="chemform">C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>11</sub>N</span>) is formed; between coniine and conyrine stands
coniceine (<span class="chemform">C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>15</sub>NO</span>). De Coninck has made synthetically by the
addition of 6 atoms of hydrogen to &#946; collidine, a new fluid alkaloid
(<span class="chemform">C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>11</sub>N</span> + <span class="chemform">6H</span> = <span class="chemform">C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>17</sub>N</span>), which he has called <i>isocicutine</i>: it has the
same formula as coniine. Paraconiine Schiff prepared synthetically
from ammonia and normal butyl aldehyde; it has the formula <span class="chemform">C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>15</sub>N</span>,
and therefore differs from coniine in containing two atoms less of hydrogen.
All the above have a similar physiological action to coniine. &#945;-stillbazoline
(<span class="chemform">C<sub>11</sub>H<sub>19</sub>N</span>), prepared by Baurath from benzaldehyde and picoline, is
analogous to coniine, and according to Falck has similar action, but is
more powerful.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_321" id="Sect_321"></a>&sect; 321. <b>Pharmaceutical Preparations.</b>&mdash;The percentage of coniine in
the plant itself, and in pharmaceutical preparations, can be approximately
determined by distilling the coniine over, in a partial vacuum,<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
titrating the distillate with Mayer&#8217;s reagent, each c.c. = about &middot;00416 grm.
of coniine. It appears to be necessary to add powdered potassic chloride
and a small quantity of diluted sulphuric acid before titrating, or the
precipitate does not separate. In any case, the end of the reaction is
difficult to observe.<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

<p>The fresh plant is said to contain from about &middot;04 to &middot;09 per cent., and
the fruit about 0&middot;7 per cent. of coniine.</p>

<p>The officinal preparations are&mdash;the leaves, the fruit, a tincture of the
fruit, an extract of the leaves, the juice of the leaves (<i>Succus conii</i>), a
compound hemlock pill (composed of extract of hemlock, ipecacuanha,
and treacle), an inhalation of coniine (<i>Vapor conii</i>), and a poultice
(<i>Cataplasma conii</i>) made with the leaves.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_322" id="Sect_322"></a>&sect; 322. <b>Statistics of Coniine Poisoning.</b>&mdash;F. A. Falck<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> has been able
to collect 17 cases of death recorded in medical literature, up to the
year 1880, from either coniine or hemlock. Two of these cases were
criminal (murders), 1 suicidal, 2 cases in which coniine had been used
medicinally (in one instance the extract had been applied to a cancerous
breast; in the other, death was produced from the injection of an
infusion of hemlock leaves). The remaining 12 were cases in which
the root, leaves, or other portions of the plant had been ignorantly or
accidentally eaten.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_323" id="Sect_323"></a>&sect; 323. <b>Effects on Animals.</b>&mdash;It destroys all forms of animal life. The
author made some years ago an investigation as to its action on the common
blow-fly. Droplets of coniine were applied to various parts of blow-flies,
which were then placed under glass shades. The symptoms began within a
minute by signs of external irritation, there were rapid motions of the wings,
and quick and aimless movements of the legs. Torpor set in speedily,
the buzz soon ceased, and the insects lay on their sides, motionless,
but for occasional twitching of the legs. The wings, as a rule, became
completely paralysed before the legs, and death occurred at a rather
variable time, from ten minutes to two hours. If placed in a current
of air in the sun, a fly completely under the influence of coniine may
recover. Coniine causes in frogs, similar to curarine, peripheral paralysis
of the motor nerves, combined with a transitory stimulation, and
afterwards a paralysis of the motor centres; in frogs the paralysis is
not preceded by convulsions. Dragendorff experimented on the action
of coniine when given to five cats, the quantities used being &middot;05 to &middot;5
grm. The symptoms came on almost immediately, but with the smaller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
dose given to a large cat, no effect was witnessed until twenty-five
minutes afterwards; this was the longest interval. One of the earliest
phenomena was dilatation of the pupil, followed by weakness of the limbs
passing into paralysis, the hinder legs being affected prior to the fore.
The respiration became troubled, and the frequency of the breathing
diminished; the heart in each case acted irregularly, and the sensation
generally was blunted; death was preceded by convulsions. In the
cases in which the larger dose of &middot;4 to &middot;5 grm. was administered, death
took place within the hour, one animal dying in eight minutes, a second
in eighteen minutes, a third in twenty minutes, and a fourth in fifty-eight
minutes. With the smaller dose of &middot;051 grm. given to a large cat,
death did not take place until eight hours and forty-seven minutes after
administration.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_324" id="Sect_324"></a>&sect; 324. <b>Effects on Man.</b>&mdash;In a case recorded by Bennet,<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> and quoted
in most works on forensic medicine, the symptoms were those of general
muscular weakness deepening into paralysis. The patient had eaten
hemlock in mistake for parsley; in about twenty minutes he experienced
weakness in the lower extremities, and staggered in walking like a
drunken man; within two hours there was perfect paralysis of both
upper and lower extremities, and he died in three and a quarter hours.
In another case, related by Taylor, the symptoms were also mainly those
of paralysis, and in other instances stupor, coma, and slight convulsions
have been noted.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p><a name="Sect_325" id="Sect_325"></a>&sect; 325. <b>Physiological Action.</b>&mdash;It is generally agreed that coniine
paralyses, first the ends of the motor nerves, afterwards their trunks,
and lastly, the motor centre itself. At a later period the sensory nerves
participate. In the earlier stage the respiration is quickened, the pupils
contracted, and the blood-pressure increased; but on the development of
paralysis the breathing becomes slowed, the capillaries relaxed, and the
blood-pressure sinks. Death takes place from cessation of the respiration,
and not primarily from the heart, the heart beating after the breathing
has stopped. Coniine is eliminated by the urine, and is also in part
separated by the lungs, while a portion is, perhaps, decomposed in the
body.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_326" id="Sect_326"></a>&sect; 326. <b>Post-mortem Appearances.</b>&mdash;There is nothing characteristic
in the appearances after death.</p>

<p><b>Fatal Dose.</b>&mdash;The fatal dose of coniine is not accurately known; it is
about 150 mgrms. (2&middot;3 grains). In the case of Louise Berger, 10 to 15
drops appear to have caused death in a few minutes. The auto-experiments
of Dworzak, Heinrich, and Dillaberger would indicate that one
drop may cause unpleasant symptoms. Albers, in the treatment of a
woman suffering from cancer of the breast, witnessed convulsions and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
loss of consciousness from a third dose of 4 mgrms. (&middot;06 grain); and
Eulenberg, its full narcotic effects on a child after subcutaneous injection
of 1 mgrm. (&middot;015 grain).</p>

<p><a name="Sect_327" id="Sect_327"></a>&sect; 327. <b>Separation of Coniine from Organic Matters or Tissues.</b>&mdash;The
substances are digested with water, acidulated with <span class="chemform">H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub></span>, at a
temperature not exceeding 40&deg;, and then filtered. If the filtrate should
be excessive, it must be concentrated; alcohol is then added, the liquid
refiltered, and from the filtrate the alcohol separated by distillation.</p>

<p>On cooling, the acid fluid is agitated with benzene, and the latter
separated in the usual way. The fluid is now alkalised with ammonia,
and shaken up once or twice with its own volume of petroleum ether;
the latter is separated and washed with distilled water, and the alkaloid
is obtained almost pure. If the petroleum ether leaves no residue, it is
certain that the alkaloid was not present in the contents of the stomach
or intestine.</p>

<p>The affinity of coniine with ether or chloroform is such, that its solution
in either of these fluids, passed through a <i>dry</i> filter, scarcely retains
a drop of water. In this way it may be conveniently purified, the impurities
dissolved by water remaining behind.</p>

<p>In searching for coniine, the stomach, intestines, blood, urine, liver,
and lungs are the parts which should be examined. According to
Dragendorff, it has been discovered in the body of a cat six weeks after
death.</p>

<p>Great care must be exercised in identifying any volatile alkaloid as
coniine, for the sources of error seem to be numerous. In one case<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> a
volatile coniine-like ptomaine, was separated from a corpse, and thought
to be coniine; but Otto found that in its behaviour to platinic chloride,
it differed from coniine; it was very poisonous&mdash;&middot;07 was fatal to a frog,
&middot;44 to a pigeon, in a few minutes. In the seeds of <i>Lupinus luteus</i> there
is a series of coniine-like substances,<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> but they do not give the characteristic
crystals with hydrochloric acid.</p>

<h5>2. TOBACCO&mdash;NICOTINE.</h5>

<p><a name="Sect_328" id="Sect_328"></a>&sect; 328. The different forms of tobacco are furnished by three species
of the tobacco plant, viz., <i>Nicotianum tabacum</i>, <i>N. rustica</i>, and <i>N.
persica</i>.</p>

<p>Havanna, French, Dutch, and the American tobaccos are in the main
derived from <i>N. tabacum</i>; Turkish, Syrian, and the Latakia tobaccos
are the produce of <i>N. rustica</i>. There seems at present to be little of
<i>N. persica</i> in commerce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>All the species of tobacco contain a liquid, volatile, poisonous alkaloid
(<i>Nicotine</i>), probably united in the plant with citric and malic acids.
There is also present in tobacco an unimportant camphor (<i>nicotianin</i>).
The general composition of the plant may be gathered from the following

<p><a name="Sect_329" id="Sect_329"></a>&sect; 329. <b>Quantitative Estimation of Nicotine in Tobacco.</b>&mdash;The best
process (although not a perfectly accurate one) is the following:&mdash;25
grms. of the tobacco are mixed with milk of lime, and allowed to
stand until there is no odour of ammonia; the mixture is then exhausted
by petroleum ether, the ether shaken up with a slight excess of normal
sulphuric acid, and titrated back by baryta water; the sulphate of baryta
may be collected and weighed, so as to control the results. With regard
to the percentage of nicotine in commercial tobacco, Kosutany found from
1&middot;686 to 3&middot;738 per cent. in dry tobacco; Letheby, in six samples, from
1&middot;5 to 3&middot;2 per cent.; whilst Schl&ouml;ssing gives for Havanna 2 per cent.,
Maryland 2&middot;29 per cent., Kentucky 6&middot;09 per cent., Virginian 6&middot;87 per
cent., and for French tobacco, quantities varying from 3&middot;22 to 7&middot;96 per
cent. Again, Lenoble found in Paraguay tobacco from 1&middot;8 to 6 per
cent.; and Wittstein, in six sorts of tobacco in Germany, 1&middot;54 to 2&middot;72
per cent.</p>

<p>Mr. Cox<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> has recently determined the amount of nicotine in a number

<p>It is therefore obvious that the strength of tobacco in nicotine varies
between wide limits.</p>

<p>Twenty-five grammes (or more or less, according to the amount of the
sample at disposal) of the dried and powdered tobacco were intimately
mixed with slaked lime, and distilled in a current of steam until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
condensed steam was no longer alkaline; the distillate was slightly
acidulated with dilute <span class="chemform">H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub></span>, and evaporated to a conveniently small
bulk. This was made alkaline with soda, and agitated repeatedly with
successive portions of ether. The separated batches of ethereal solution
of nicotine were then mixed and exposed to the air in a cool place.
This exposure to the air carries away ammonia, if any be present, as well
as ether.</p>

<p>Water was added to the ethereal residue, and the amount of nicotine
present determined by decinormal <span class="chemform">H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub></span>, using methyl-orange as an indicator.
One c.c. of decinormal <span class="chemform">H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub></span> represents 0&middot;0162 gramme of
nicotine (<span class="chemform">C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>14</sub>N<sub>2</sub></span>).</p>

<p>Alcohol and ether dissolve nicotine in every proportion; if such
solutions are distilled, nicotine goes over first. The salts which it forms
with hydrochloric, nitric, and phosphoric acids crystallise with difficulty;
tartaric and oxalic acid form white crystalline salts, and the latter, oxalate
of nicotine, is soluble in alcohol, a property which distinguishes it from
the oxalate of ammonia. The best salts are the oxalate and the acid
tartrate of nicotine, from which to regenerate nicotine in a pure state.</p>

<p>Hydrochloride of nicotine is more easily volatilised than the pure base.
Nicotine is precipitated by alkalies, &amp;c., also by many oxyhydrates, lead,
copper, &amp;c. By the action of light, it is soon coloured yellow and brown,
and becomes thick, in which state it leaves, on evaporation, a brown
resinous substance, only partly soluble in petroleum ether.</p>

<p>A very excellent test for nicotine, as confirmatory of others, is the
beautiful, long, needle-like crystals obtained by adding to an ethereal
solution of nicotine a solution of iodine in ether. The crystals require a
few hours to form.</p>

<p>Chlorine gas colours nicotine blood-red or brown; the product is soluble
in alcohol, and separates on evaporation in crystals.</p>

<p>Cyanogen also colours nicotine brown; the product out of alcohol is
not crystalline. Platin chloride throws down a reddish crystalline precipitate,
soluble on warming; and gallic acid gives a flocculent precipitate.
A drop of nicotine poured on dry chromic acid blazes up, and gives out
an odour of tobacco camphor; if the ignition does not occur in the cold,
it is produced by a gentle heat. It is scarcely possible to confound
nicotine with ammonia, by reason of its odour; and, moreover, ammonia
may always be excluded by converting the base into the oxalate, and
dissolving in absolute alcohol.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a confusion between coniine and nicotine is apt
to occur when small quantities only are dealt with. It may, however,
be guarded against by the following tests:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1.) If coniine be converted into oxalate, the oxalate dissolved in
alcohol, and coniine regenerated by distillation (best in <i>vacuo</i>) with
caustic lye, and then hydrochloric acid added, a crystalline hydrochlorate
of coniine is formed, which doubly refracts light, and is in needle-shaped
or columnar crystals, or dendritic, moss-like forms. The columns afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
become torn, and little rows of cubical, octahedral, and tetrahedral
crystals (often cross or dagger-shaped) grow out of yellow amorphous
masses. Crystalline forms of this kind are rare, save in the case of
dilute solutions of chloride of ammonium (the presence of the latter is, of
course, rendered by the treatment impossible); and nicotine does not
give anything similar to this reaction.</p>

<p>(2.) Coniine coagulates albumen; nicotine does not.</p>

<p>(3.) Nicotine yields a characteristic crystalline precipitate with an
aqueous solution of mercuric chloride; the similar precipitate of coniine
is amorphous.</p>

<p>(4.) Nicotine does not react with <span class="chemform">CS<sub>2</sub></span> to form thiosulphate (see
<a href="#Page_266">p. 266</a>).</p>

<p><a name="Sect_331" id="Sect_331"></a>&sect; 331. <b>Effects on Animals.</b>&mdash;Nicotine is rapidly fatal to all animal
life&mdash;from the lowest to the highest forms. That tobacco-smoke is
inimical to insect-life is known to everybody; very minute quantities in
water kill infusoria. Fish of 30 grms. weight die in a few minutes
from a milligram of nicotine; the symptoms observed are rapid movements,
then shivering and speedy paralysis, with decreased motion of the
gills, and death. With frogs, if doses not too large are employed, there
is first great restlessness, then strong tetanic convulsions, and a very
peculiar position of the limbs; the respiration after fatal doses soon
ceases, but the heart beats even after death. Birds also show tetanic
convulsions followed by paralysis and speedy death. The symptoms
witnessed in mammals poisoned by nicotine are not essentially dissimilar.
With large doses the effect is similar to that of prussic acid&mdash;viz., a cry,
one or two shuddering convulsions, and death. If the dose is not too
large, there is trembling of the limbs, excretion of f&aelig;ces and urine, a
peculiar condition of stupor, a staggering gait, and then the animal falls
on its side. The respiration, at first quickened, is afterwards slowed, and
becomes deeper than natural; the pulse, also, with moderate doses, is
first slowed, then rises in frequency, and finally, again falls. Tetanic
convulsions soon develop, during the tetanus the pupils have been
noticed to be contracted, but afterwards dilated, the tongue and mouth
are livid, and the vessels of the ear dilated. Very characteristic of
nicotine poisoning as witnessed in the cat, the rabbit, and the dog, is its
peculiarly violent action, for after the administration of from one to two
drops, the whole course from the commencement of symptoms to the death
may take place in five minutes. F. Vas has drawn the smoke of tobacco
from an immense pipe, and condensed the products; he finds the well-washed
tarry products without physiological action, but the soluble liquid
affected the health of rabbits,&mdash;they lost weight, the number of the blood
corpuscles was decreased, and the h&aelig;moglobin of the blood diminished.<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

<p>The larger animals, such as the horse, are affected similarly to the
smaller domestic animals. A veterinary surgeon, Mr. John Howard, of
Woolwich,<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> has recorded a case in which a horse suffered from the most
violent symptoms of nicotine-poisoning, after an application to his skin
of a strong decoction of tobacco. The symptoms were trembling, particularly
at the posterior part of the shoulders, as well as at the flanks,
and both fore and hind extremities; the superficial muscles were generally
relaxed and felt flabby; and the pupils were widely dilated. There
was also violent dyspn&#339;a, the respirations being quick and short, pulse
32 per minute, and extremely feeble, fluttering, and indistinct. When
made to walk, the animal appeared to have partly lost the use of his
hind limbs, the posterior quarter rolling from side to side in an unsteady
manner, the legs crossing each other, knuckling over, and appearing to be
seriously threatened with paralysis. The anus was very prominent, the
bowels extremely irritable, and tenesmus was present. He passed much
flatus, and at intervals of three or four minutes, small quantities of f&aelig;ces
in balls, partly in the liquid state, and coated with slimy mucus. There
was a staring, giddy, intoxicated appearance about the head and eyes,
the visible mucous membrane being of a dark-red colour. A great
tendency to collapse was evident, but by treatment with cold douches and
exposure to the open air, the horse recovered.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_332" id="Sect_332"></a>&sect; 332. <b>Effects on Man.</b>&mdash;Poisoning by the pure alkaloid nicotine is so
rare that, up to the present, only three cases are on record. The first of
these is ever memorable in the history of toxicology, being the first
instance in which a pure alkaloid had been criminally used. The detection
of the poison exercised the attention of the celebrated chemist Stas.
I allude, of course, to the poisoning of M. Fougnies by Count Bocarm&eacute;
and his wife. For the unabridged narrative of this interesting case the
reader may consult Tardieu&#8217;s <i>&Eacute;tude M&eacute;dico-L&eacute;gale sur L&#8217;Empoisonnement</i>.</p>

<p>Bocarm&eacute; actually studied chemistry in order to prepare the alkaloid
himself, and, after having succeeded in enticing his victim to the chateau
of Bitremont, administered the poison forcibly. It acted immediately,
and death took place in five minutes. Bocarm&eacute; now attempted to hide
all traces of the nicotine by pouring strong acetic acid into the mouth
and over the body of the deceased. The wickedness and cruelty of the
crime were only equalled by the clumsy and unskilful manner of its
perpetration. The quantity of nicotine actually used in this case must
have been enormous, for Stas separated no less than &middot;4 grm. from the
stomach of the victim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>The second known case of nicotine-poisoning was that of a man who
took it for the purpose of suicide. The case is related by Taylor. It
occurred in June 1863. The gentleman drank an unknown quantity
from a bottle; he stared wildly, fell to the floor, heaving a deep sigh, and
died quietly without convulsion. The third case happened at Cherbourg,<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>
where an officer committed suicide by taking nicotine, but how much had
been swallowed, and what were the symptoms, are equally unknown, for
no one saw him during life.</p>

<p>Poisoning by nicotine, pure and simple, then is rare. Tobacco-poisoning
is very common, and has probably been experienced in a mild degree by
every smoker in first acquiring the habit. Nearly all the fatal cases are to
be ascribed to accident; but criminal cases are not unknown. Christison
relates an instance in which tobacco in the form of snuff was put into
whisky for the purpose of robbery. In 1854, a man was accused of
attempting to poison his wife by putting snuff into her ale, but acquitted.
In another case, the father of a child, ten weeks old, killed the infant by
putting tobacco into its mouth. He defended himself by saying that it
was applied to make the child sleep.</p>

<p>In October 1855,<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> a drunken sailor swallowed (perhaps for the purpose
of suicide) his quid of tobacco, containing from about half an ounce to an
ounce. He had it some time in his mouth, and in half an hour suffered
from frightful tetanic convulsions. There was also diarrh&#339;a; the pupils
were dilated widely; the heart&#8217;s action became irregular; and towards the
end the pupils again contracted. He died in a sort of syncope, seven
hours after swallowing the tobacco.</p>

<p>Tobacco-juice, as expressed or distilled by the heat developed in the
usual method of smoking, is very poisonous. Sonnenschein relates the
case of a drunken student, who was given a dram to drink, into which
his fellows had poured the juice from their pipes. The result was fatal.
Death from smoking is not unknown.<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> Helwig saw death follow in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
case of two brothers, who smoked seventeen and eighteen German pipefuls
of tobacco. Marshall Hall<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> records the case of a young man, nineteen
years of age, who, after learning to smoke for two days, attempted
two consecutive pipes. He suffered from very serious symptoms, and did
not completely recover for several days. Gordon has also recorded severe
poisoning from the consecutive smoking of nine cigars. The external
application of the leaf may, as already shown in the case of the horse,
produce all the effects of the internal administration of nicotine. The
old instance, related by Hildebrand, of the illness of a whole squadron of
hussars who attempted to smuggle tobacco by concealing the leaf next to
their skin, is well known, and is supported by several recent and similar
cases. The common practice of the peasantry, in many parts of England,
of applying tobacco to stop the bleeding of wounds, and also as a sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
poultice to local swellings, has certainly its dangers. The symptoms&mdash;whether
nicotine has been taken by absorption through the broken or
unbroken skin, by the bowel, by absorption through smoking, or by the
expressed juice, or the consumption of the leaf itself&mdash;show no very great
difference, save in the question of time. Pure nicotine acts with as great
a rapidity as prussic acid; while if, so to speak, it is entangled in tobacco,
it takes more time to be separated and absorbed; besides which, nicotine,
taken in the concentrated condition, is a strong enough base to have slight
caustic effects, and thus leaves some local evidences of its presence. In
order to investigate the effects of pure nicotine, Dworzak and Heinrich
made auto-experiments, beginning with 1 mgrm. This small dose produced
unpleasant sensations in the mouth and throat, salivation, and a
peculiar feeling spreading from the region of the stomach to the fingers
and toes. With 2 mgrms. there was headache, giddiness, numbness,
disturbances of vision, torpor, dulness of hearing, and quickened respirations.
With 3 to 4 mgrms., in about forty minutes there was a great
feeling of faintness, intense depression, weakness, with pallid face and
cold extremities, sickness, and purging. One experimenter had shivering
of the extremities and cramps of the muscles of the back, with difficult
breathing. The second suffered from muscular weakness, fainting, fits of
shivering, and creeping sensations about the arms. In two or three hours
the severer effects passed away, but recovery was not complete for two or
three days. It is therefore evident, from these experiments and from
other cases, that excessive muscular prostration, difficult breathing, tetanic
cramps, diarrh&#339;a, and vomiting, with irregular pulse, represent both
tobacco and nicotine poisoning. The rapidly-fatal result of pure nicotine
has been already mentioned; but with tobacco-poisoning the case may
terminate lethally in eighteen minutes. This rapid termination is unusual,
with children it is commonly about an hour and a half, although in
the case previously mentioned, death did not take place for two days.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_359" id="Footnote_359"></a><a href="#FNanchor_359"><span class="label">[359]</span></a> The question as to whether there is much nicotine in tobacco-smoke
cannot be considered settled; but it is probable that most of the
poisonous symptoms produced are referable to the pyridene bases of the
general formula (<span class="chemform">C<sub class="tab">n</sub>H<sub class="tab">2n-5</sub>N</span>). Vohl and Eulenberg (<i>Arch. Pharmac.</i>,
2, cxlvi. p. 130) made some very careful experiments on the smoke of
strong tobacco, burnt both in pipes and also in cigars. The method
adopted was to draw the smoke first through potash, and then through
dilute sulphuric acid. The potash absorbed prussic acid, hydric
sulphide, formic, acetic, propionic, butyric, valeric, and carbolic
acids; while in the acid the bases were fixed, and these were found to
consist of the whole series of pyridene bases, from pyridene
(<span class="chemform">C<sub class="tab">5</sub>H<sub class="tab">5</sub>N</span>), boil. point 117&deg;, picoline (<span class="chemform">C<sub class="tab">6</sub>H<sub class="tab">7</sub>N</span>), boil. point
133&deg;, lutidine (<span class="chemform">C<sub class="tab">7</sub>H<sub class="tab">9</sub>N</span>), boil. point 154&deg;, upwards. When smoked in
pipes, the chief yield was pyridene; when in cigars, collidine
(<span class="chemform">C<sub class="tab">8</sub>H<sub class="tab">11</sub>N</span>); and in general, pipe-smoking was found to produce a
greater number of volatile bases. The action of these bases has been
investigated by several observers. They all have a special action on the
organism, and all show an increase in physiological activity as the
series is ascended. The lowest produce merely excitement from irritation
of the encephalic nervous centres, and the highest, paralysis of those
centres. Death proceeds from gradual failure of the respiratory
movements, leading to asphyxia&mdash;(Kendrick and Dewar, <i>Proc. Roy. Soc.</i>,
xxii. 442; xxiii. 290). The most recent experimental work is that of A.
Gautier; he found that tobacco smoked in a pipe produced basic
compounds, a large quantity of nicotine, and a higher homologue of
nicotine, <span class="chemform">C<sub class="tab">11</sub>H<sub class="tab">16</sub>N<sub class="tab">2</sub></span>, which pre-exists in tobacco leaves, and a
base <span class="chemform">C<sub class="tab">6</sub>H<sub class="tab">9</sub>NO</span>, which seems to be a hydrate of picoline&mdash;(<i>Compt.
Rend.</i>, t. cxv. p. 992, 993). The derivatives of the pyridene series are
also active. The methiodides strongly excite the brain and paralyse the
extremities. A similar but more energetic action is exerted by the ethyl
and allyl derivatives; the iodyallyl derivatives are strong poisons.
Methylic pyridene carboxylate is almost inactive, but the corresponding
ammonium salt gives rise to symptoms resembling epilepsy&mdash;(Ramsay,
<i>Phil. Mag.</i>, v. 4, 241). One member of the pyridene series
&#946;-lutidine has been elaborately investigated by C. Greville
Williams and W. H. Waters&mdash;(<i>Proc. Roy. Soc.</i>, vol. xxxii. p. 162,
1881). They conclude that it affects the heart profoundly, causing an
increase in its tonicity, but the action is almost confined to the
ventricles. The auricles are but little affected, and continue to beat
after the ventricles have stopped. The rate of the heart&#8217;s beat is
slowed, and the inhibitory power of the vagus arrested. By its action on
the nervous cells of the spinal cord, it in the first place lengthens
the time of reflex action, and then arrests that function. Finally, they
point out that it is antagonistic to strychnine, and may be successfully
employed to arrest the action of strychnine on the spinal cord.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_334" id="Sect_334"></a>&sect; 334. <b>Physiological Action.</b>&mdash;Nicotine is absorbed into the blood
and excreted unchanged, in part by the kidneys and in part by the
saliva (<i>Dragendorff</i>). According to the researches of Rosenthal and
Krocker,<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> nicotine acts energetically on the brain, at first exciting it,
and then lessening its activity; the spinal marrow is similarly affected.
The convulsions appear to have a cerebral origin; paralysis of the peripheral
nerves follows later than that of the nerve centres, whilst muscular
irritability is unaffected. The convulsions are not influenced by artificial
respiration, and are therefore to be considered as due to the direct influence
of the alkaloid on the nervous system. Nicotine has a striking
influence on the respiration, first quickening, then slowing, and lastly
arresting the respiratory movements: section of the vagus is without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
influence on this action. The cause of death is evidently due to the
rapid benumbing and paralysis of the respiratory centre. Death never
follows from heart-paralysis, although nicotine powerfully influences the
heart&#8217;s action, small doses exciting the terminations of the vagus in the
heart, and causing a slowing of the beats. Large doses paralyse both
the controlling and exciting nerve-centres of the heart; the heart then
beats fast, irregularly, and weakly. The blood-vessels are first narrowed,
then dilated, and, as a consequence, the blood-pressure first rises, then
falls. Nicotine has a special action on the intestines. As O. Nasse<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>
has shown, there is a strong contraction of the whole tract, especially of
the small intestine, the lumen of which may be, through a continuous
tetanus, rendered very small. This is ascribed to the peripheral excitation
of the intestinal nerves and the ganglia. The uterus is also excited
to strong contraction by nicotine; the secretions of the bile and saliva

for rabbits, a quarter of a drop; for an adult not accustomed to tobacco
the lethal dose is probably 6 mgrms.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_336" id="Sect_336"></a>&sect; 336. <b>Post-mortem Appearances.</b>&mdash;There seem to be no appearances
so distinctive as to be justly ascribed to nicotine or tobacco-poisoning
and no other.</p>

<p>A more or less fluid condition of the blood, and, generally, the signs of
death by the lungs, are those most frequently found. In tobacco-poisoning,
when the leaves themselves have been swallowed, there may
be some inflammatory redness of the stomach and intestine.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_337" id="Sect_337"></a>&sect; 337. <b>Separation of Nicotine from Organic Matters, &amp;c.</b>&mdash;The
process for the isolation of nicotine is precisely that used for coniine (see
<a href="#Page_269">p. 269</a>). It appears that it is unaltered by putrefaction, and may be
separated and recognised by appropriate means a long time after death.
Orfila detected it in an animal two or three months after death; Melsens
discovered the alkaloid unmistakably in the tongues of two dogs, which
had been buried in a vessel filled with earth for seven years; and it has
been found, by several experiments, in animals buried for shorter periods.
Nicotine should always be looked for in the tongue and mucous membrane
of the mouth, as well as in the usual viscera. The case may be
much complicated if the person supposed to be poisoned should have
been a smoker; for the defence would naturally be that there had been
either excessive smoking or chewing, or even swallowing accidentally a
quid of tobacco.<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> A ptomaine has been discovered similar to nicotine.
Wolckenhaar separated also an alkaloid not unlike nicotine from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
corpse of a woman addicted to intemperate habits; but this base was not
poisonous, nor did it give any crystals when an ethereal solution was
added to an ether solution of iodine. It will be well always to support
the chemical evidence by tests on animal life, since the intensely
poisonous action of nicotine seems not to be shared by the nicotine-like
ptomaines.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_338" id="Sect_338"></a>&sect; 338. Piturie (<span class="chemform">C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>N</span>) is a liquid, nicotine-like alkaloid, obtained from the
<i>Duboisia hopwoodii</i>, a small shrub or tree belonging to the natural order <i>Solanace&aelig;</i>,
indigenous in Australia. The natives mix piturie leaves with ashes from some other
plant, and chew them. Piturie is obtained by extracting the plant with boiling
water acidified with sulphuric acid, concentrating the liquid by evaporation, and
then alkalising and distilling with caustic soda, and receiving the distillate in
hydrochloric acid. The solution of the hydrochlorate is afterwards alkalised and
shaken up with ether, which readily dissolves out the piturie. The ether solution of
piturie is evaporated to dryness in a current of hydrogen, and the crude piturie
purified by distillation in hydrogen, or by changing it into its salts, and again
recovering, &amp;c. It is clear and colourless when pure and fresh, but becomes yellow
or brown when exposed to air and light. It boils and distils at 243&deg; to 244&deg;. It is
soluble in all proportions in alcohol, water, and ether; its taste is acrid and
pungent; it is volatile at ordinary temperatures, causing white fumes with hydrochloric
acid; it is very irritating to the mucous membranes, having a smell like
nicotine at first, and then, when it becomes browner, like pyridine. It forms salts
with acids, but the acetate, sulphate, and hydrochlorate are varnish-like films having
no trace of crystallisation; the oxalate is a crystalline salt. Piturie gives precipitates
with mercuric chloride, cupric sulphate, gold chloride, mercur-potassic iodide,
tannin, and an alcoholic solution of iodine. If an ethereal solution of iodine is
added to an ethereal solution of piturie, a precipitate of yellowish-red needles,
readily soluble in alcohol, is deposited. The iodine compound melts at 110&deg;, while
the iodine compound of nicotine melts at 100&deg;. Piturie is distinguished from coniine
by its aqueous solution not becoming turbid either on heating or on the addition of
chlorine water; it differs from picoline in specific gravity, picoline being &middot;9613
specific gravity at 0&deg;, and piturie sinking in water; it differs from aniline by not
being coloured by chlorinated lime. From nicotine it has several distinguishing
marks, one of the best being that it does not change colour on warming with hydrochloric
acid and the addition to the mixture afterwards of a little nitric acid. The
physiological action seems to be but little different from that of nicotine. It is, of
course, poisonous, but as yet has no forensic importance.</p>

<p>Sparteine is separated from the plant by extraction with sulphuric acid holding
water, and then alkalising the acid solution and distilling: it has the formula

substance, scarcely soluble in water, to which it imparts a strong, alkaline reaction; it
is soluble in alcohol, in ether, and chloroform; insoluble in benzene and in petroleum;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"><span class="fsize110">[280]</span></a></span>
it boils at 288&deg;. Sparteine neutralises acids fully, but the oxalate is the only one
which can be readily obtained in crystals. It forms crystalline salts with platinic
chloride, with gold chloride, with mercuric chloride, and with zinc chloride. The
picrate is an especially beautiful salt, crystallising in long needles, which, when
dried and heated, explode. On sealing sparteine up in a tube with ethyl iodide and
alcohol, and heating to 100&deg; for an hour, ethyl sparteine iodide separates in long,
needle-like crystals, which are somewhat insoluble in cold alcohol.</p>

<h5>5. ANILINE.</h5>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><a name="Sect_340" id="Sect_340"></a>&sect; 340. <b>Properties.</b>&mdash;Aniline or amido-benzol (<span class="chemform">C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NH<sub>2</sub></span>) is made by the reduction
of nitro-benzol. It is an oily fluid, colourless when quite pure, but gradually
assuming a yellow tinge on exposure to the air. It has a peculiar and distinctive
smell. It boils at 182&middot;5&deg;, and can be congealed by a cold of 8&deg;. It is slightly
soluble in water, 100 parts of water at 16&deg; retaining about 3 of aniline, and easily
soluble in alcohol, ether, and chloroform. It does not blue red-litmus paper, but
nevertheless acts as a weak alkali, for it precipitates iron from its salts. It forms a
large number of crystalline salts. The hydrochloride crystallises in white plates,
and has a melting-point of 192&deg;. The platinum compound has the formula of
<span class="chemform">(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>HCl)<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>4</sub></span>, and crystallises in yellow needles.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_341" id="Sect_341"></a>&sect; 341. <b>Symptoms and Effects.</b>&mdash;Aniline, like picric acid, coagulates albumin.
Aniline is a blood poison; it produces, even during life, in some obscure way,
meth&aelig;moglobin, and it disintegrates the red blood corpuscles; both these effects
lessen the power of the blood corpuscles to convey oxygen to the tissues, hence the
cyanosis observed so frequently in aniline poisoning is explained. Engelhardt<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> has
found that aniline black is produced; in every drop of blood there are fine black
granules, the total effect of which produce a pale blue or grey-blue colour of the
skin. Aniline has also an action on the central nervous system, at first stimulating,
and then paralysing. Schmiedeberg finds that para-amido-phenol-ether-sulphuric acid
is produced, and appears in the urine as an alkali salt; a small quantity of fuchsine is also
produced, and has been found in the urine. Some aniline may be excreted unchanged.</p>

<p>The symptoms are giddiness, weakness, cyanosis, blueness of the skin, sinking of
the temperature, and dilatation of the pupil. The pulse is small and frequent, the
skin moist and cold. The patient smells of aniline. Towards the end coma and convulsions
set in. The urine may be brown to brown-black, and may contain hyaline
cylinders. The blood shows the spectrum of meth&aelig;moglobin, and has the peculiarities
already mentioned. Should the patient recover, jaundice often follows.
The outward application of aniline produces eczema.</p>

<p>Chronic poisoning by aniline is occasionally seen among workers in the manufacture
of aniline. Headache, loss of muscular power, diminished sensibility of the
skin, vomiting, loss of appetite, pallor, eruptions on the skin, and general malaise
are the chief symptoms. The perspiration has been noticed to have a reddish colour.</p>

<p>Cases of aniline poisoning are not common; Dr. Fred. J. Smith has recorded one
in the <i>Lancet</i> of January 13, 1894.<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> The patient, a woman, 42 years of age, of

oxygen administered, but the patient died comatose almost exactly twelve hours
after the poison had been taken.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_343" id="Sect_343"></a>&sect; 343. <b>Detection of Aniline.</b>&mdash;Aniline is easily separated and detected. Organic
fluids are alkalised by a solution of potash, and distilled. The organs, finely divided,
are extracted with water acidulated with sulphuric acid, the fluid filtered, and then
alkalised and distilled. The distillate is shaken up with ether, the ether separated
and allowed to evaporate spontaneously. Any aniline will be in the residue left after
evaporation of the ether, and may be identified by the following tests:&mdash;An aqueous
solution of aniline or its salts is coloured blue by a little chloride of lime or hypochlorite
of soda; later on the mixture becomes red. The blue colour has an absorption
band, when examined spectroscopically, extending from W.L. 656 to 560, and
therefore in the red and yellow from Fraunhofer&#8217;s line C, and overlapping D.
Another test for aniline is the addition of kairine, hydrochloric acid, and sodium
nitrite, which strikes a blue colour.</p>

<h4>III.&mdash;The Opium Group of Alkaloids.</h4>

<p><a name="Sect_344" id="Sect_344"></a>&sect; 344. <b>General Composition.</b>&mdash;Opium contains a larger number of
basic substances than any plant known. The list reaches at present to
18 or 19 nitrogenised bases, and almost each year there have been
additions. Some of these alkaloids exist in very small proportion, and
have been little studied. Morphine and narcotine are those which, alone,
are toxicologically important. Opium is a gummy mass, consisting of the
juice of the incised unripe fruit of the <i>Papaver somniferum</i> hardened in
the air. The following is a nearly complete list of the constituents
which have been found in opium:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

and it also takes up a little of the resin.</p>

<p><b>Ether, Benzene, and Carbon Sulphide</b> do not dissolve the resin, and
only slightly morphine, if free; but they dissolve the other free alkaloids
as well as caoutchouc.</p>

<p><b>Acids</b> dissolve all the alkaloids and the resin.</p>

<p><b>Fixed Alkalies</b>, in excess, dissolve in part resin; they also dissolve
morphine freely; narcotine remains insoluble.</p>

<p><b>Lime Water</b> dissolves morphine, but is a solvent for narcotine only in
presence of morphine.</p>

<p><b>Ammonia</b> dissolves only traces of morphine; but narceine and codeine
readily. It does not dissolve the other alkaloids, nor does it dissolve the
resin.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_346" id="Sect_346"></a>&sect; 346. <b>Assay of Opium.</b>&mdash;The following processes may be described:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p><b>Process of Teschemacher and Smith.</b>&mdash;This process, with a few modifications,
is as follows:&mdash;10 grms. of opium are as completely exhausted
with proof spirit at a boiling temperature as possible. The resulting
alcoholic extract is treated with a few drops of ammonium oxalate
solution, and the solution is almost neutralised with ammonia. The
solution is concentrated to one-third, cooled, and filtered. The filtrate is
farther concentrated to 5 c.c., and transferred to a small flask, it is
washed into this flask by 4 c.c. of water, and 3 c.c. of 90 per cent.
alcohol; next 2 c.c. solution of ammonia (sp. gr. 0&middot;960) and 25 c.c. of
dry ether are added. The flask is corked, shaken, and then allowed to
rest over-night.</p>

<p>The ether is decanted as completely as possible. Two filter papers are
taken and counterpoised&mdash;that is to say, they are made precisely the
same weight. The filters are placed one inside the other, and the precipitate
collected on the inner one; the precipitate is washed with
morphinated water&mdash;that is to say, water in which morphine has been
digested for some days. The filter papers with their contents are washed
with benzene and dried, the outer paper put on the pan of the
balance carrying the weights, and the inner filter with the precipitate
weighed. The precipitate is now digested with a known volume of
decinormal acid, and then the excess of acid ascertained by titration with
decinormal alkali, using either litmus or methyl orange; each c.c. of
decinormal acid is equal to 30&middot;3 mgrms. of morphine.<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p><b>Dott&#8217;s Process.</b>&mdash;Dott has recently proposed a new process, which he
states has given good results. The process is as follows:&mdash;10 grammes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
powdered opium are digested with 25 c.c. water; 1&middot;8 gramme barium
chloride dissolved in about 12 c.c. water is then added, the solution
made up to 50 c.c., well mixed, and after a short time filtered. 22 c.c.
(representing 5 grammes opium) are mixed with dilute sulphuric acid in
quantity just sufficient to precipitate the barium. About 1 c.c. is
required, and the solution should be warmed to cause the precipitate to
subside, and the solution to filter clear. To this filtered solution a little
dilute ammonia, about 0&middot;5 c.c. is added to neutralise the free acid, and
the solution concentrated to 6 or 7 c.c., and allowed to cool. 1 c.c.
spirit and 1 c.c. ether are then added, and next ammonia in slight excess.
The ammonia should be added gradually until there is no further precipitation,
and a perceptible odour of ammonia remains after well stirring
and breaking down any lumps with the stirring rod. After three hours
the precipitate is collected on counterpoised filters and washed. Before
filtering, it should be noted that the solution has a faint odour of
ammonia: if not, one or two drops of ammonia solution should be added.
The dried precipitate is washed with benzene or chloroform, dried, and
weighed. It is then titrated with <sup><i>n</i></sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub> acid, until the morphine is
neutralised, as indicated by the solution reddening litmus paper.<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_371" id="Footnote_371"></a><a href="#FNanchor_371"><span class="label">[371]</span></a> Other methods of opium assay have been published: see Mr. A. B.
Prescott&#8217;s method (<i>Proceedings of Amer. Pharm. Assoc.</i>, 1878); Allen
(<i>Commercial Org. Analysis</i>, vol. ii. p. 473); E. R. Squibb&#8217;s
modification of Fl&uuml;ckiger&#8217;s method (<i>Pharm. Journ.</i> (3), xii. p. 724); a
rapid mode of opium assay, MM. Portes and Lanjlois (<i>Journ. de Pharm. et
de Chim.</i>, Nov. 1881); <i>Year Book of Pharmacy</i>, 1882.</p>

<p>To the above may be added&mdash;(1.) <i>Schacht&#8217;s Method.</i>&mdash;5 to 10 grms. of
dry, finely-powdered opium are digested with sufficient distilled water
to make a thin pulp. After twenty-four hours the whole is thrown on a
weighed filter, and washed until the washings are almost colourless and
tasteless. The portion insoluble in water is dried at 100&deg; and weighed;
in good opium this should not exceed 40 per cent. The filtrate is
evaporated until it is about one-fifth of the weight of the opium taken
originally; cooled, filtered, and treated with pure animal charcoal,
until the dark brown colour is changed into a brownish-yellow. The
liquid is then refiltered, precipitated with a slight excess of ammonia,
allowed to stand in an open vessel until all odour of ammonia
disappears, and at the same time frequently stirred, in order that the
precipitate may not become crystalline&mdash;a form which is always more
difficult to purify. The precipitate is now collected on a tared filter,
washed, dried, and weighed. With an opium containing 10 per cent. of
morphine, its weight is usually 14 per cent. A portion of the
precipitate is then detached from the filter, weighed, and exhausted,
first with ether, and afterwards with boiling alcohol (0&middot;81 specific
gravity). Being thus purified from narcotine, and containing a little
colouring-matter only, it may now be dried and weighed, and the amount
of morphine calculated, on the whole, from the data obtained.</p>

<p>(2.) <i>Fleury</i> has proposed a titration by oxalic acid as follows:&mdash;2
grms. of the powdered opium are macerated a few hours with 8 c.c. of
aqueous oxalate of ammonia, brought on a filter, and washed with 5 c.c.
of water. To the filtrate an equal volume of 80 per cent. alcohol and
ammonia to alkaline reaction is added; and, after standing twenty-four
hours in a closed flask, it is filtered, and the flask rinsed out with
some c.c. of 40 per cent. alcohol. The filter, with its contents, after
drying, is placed in the same flask (which should not be cleansed), a
few drops of alcoholic logwood solution are added, with an excess of
oxalic acid solution of known strength, the whole being made up to 100
c.c. This is divided into two parts, and the excess of acid titrated
back with diluted soda-lye. If the oxalic acid solution is of the
strength of 4&middot;42 grms. to the litre, every c.c. of the oxalic acid
solution which has become bound up with morphine, corresponds to 0&middot;02
grm. of morphine.</p>

<p>Of European countries, England has the greatest proportional number
of opium poisonings. In France, opium or morphine poisoning accounts
for about 1 per cent. of the whole; and Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland,
Germany, all give very small proportional numbers; arsenic, phosphorus,
and the acids taking the place of opiates. The more considerable mortality
arises, in great measure, from the pernicious practice&mdash;both of the
hard-working English mother and of the baby-farmer&mdash;of giving infants
various forms of opium sold under the name of &#8220;<i>soothing syrups</i>,&#8221;
&#8220;<i>infants&#8217; friends</i>,&#8221; &#8220;<i>infants&#8217; preservatives</i>,&#8221; &#8220;<i>nurses&#8217; drops</i>&#8221; and the like,
to allay restlessness, and to keep them during the greater part of their
existence asleep. Another fertile cause of accidental poisoning is mistakes
in dispensing; but these mistakes seem to happen more frequently on
the Continent than in England. This is in some degree due to the
decimal system, which has its dangers as well as its advantages, <i>e.g.</i>:&mdash;A
physician ordered &middot;5 decigrm. of morphine acetate in a mixture for a child,
but omitted the decimal point, and the apothecary, therefore, gave ten
times the dose desired, with fatal effect. Again, morphine hydrochlorate,
acetate, and similar soluble salts are liable to be mistaken for other white
powders, and in this way unfortunate accidents have occurred&mdash;accidents
that, with proper dispensing arrangements, should be impossible.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_349" id="Sect_349"></a>&sect; 349. <b>Poisoning of Children by Opium.</b>&mdash;The drugging of children
by opium&mdash;sometimes with a view to destroy life, sometimes merely for
the sake of the continual narcotism of the infant&mdash;is especially rife in
India.<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> A little solid opium is applied to the roof of the mouth, or
smeared on the tongue, and some Indian mothers have been known to
plaster the nipples with opium, so that the child imbibes it with the
milk. Europeans, again and again, have discovered the native nurses
administering opiates to the infants under their care, and it is feared
that in many cases detection is avoided.</p>

<p>The ignorant use of poppy-tea has frequently caused the death of
young children; thus in 1875 an inquest was held at Chelsea on the body
of a little boy two years and a half old. He had been suffering from
whooping-cough and enlargement of the bowels, and poppy-tea was by
the advice of a neighbour given to him. Two poppy-heads were used in
making a quart of tea, and the boy, after drinking a great portion of it,
fell into a deep sleep, and died with all the symptoms of narcotic
poisoning.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_350" id="Sect_350"></a>&sect; 350. <b>Doses of Opium and Morphia.</b>&mdash;Opium in the solid state is
prescribed for adults in quantities not exceeding 3 grains, the usual dose
being from 16&middot;2 mgrms. to 64&middot;8 mgrms. (<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> to 1 grain). The extract of
opium is given in exactly the same proportions (special circumstances,
such as the habitual use of opium, excepted); the dose of all the compounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
of opium is mainly regulated by the proportion of opium contained
in them.</p>

<p>The dose for children (who bear opium ill) is usually very small;
single drops of laudanum are given to infants at the breast, and the dose
cautiously increased according to age. Most practitioners would consider
half a grain a very full dose, and, in cases requiring it, would seldom
prescribe at first more than <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> to <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> grain.</p>

<p>The dose of solid opium for a horse is from 1&middot;77 grm. to 7&middot;08 grms.
(<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> drachm to 2 drachms); in extreme cases, however, 4 drachms (14&middot;16
grms.) have been given.</p>

<p>The dose for large cattle is from &middot;648 grm. to 3&middot;88 grms. (10 to 60
grains); for calves, &middot;648 grm. (10 grains); for dogs it is greatly regulated
by the size of the animal, 16&middot;2 to 129&middot;6 mgrms. (<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> grain to 2 grains).</p>

<p><b>Fatal Dose.</b>&mdash;Cases are recorded of infants dying from extremely
small doses of opium, <i>e.g.</i>, &middot;7, 4&middot;3, and 8&middot;1 mgrms. (<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>90</sub>, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>15</sub>, and <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> of a
grain); but in such instances one cannot help suspecting some mistake.
It may, however, be freely conceded that a very small quantity might
be fatal to infants, and that 3 mgrms. given to a child under one year
would probably develop serious symptoms.</p>

<p>The smallest dose of solid opium known to have proved fatal to adults
was equal to 259 mgrms. (4 grains) of crude opium (<i>Taylor</i>), and the
smallest dose of the tincture (laudanum), 7&middot;0 c.c. (2 drachms), (<i>Taylor</i>);
the latter is, however, as already shown, uncertain in its composition.</p>

<p>A dangerous dose (save under special circumstances) is:&mdash;For a horse,
14&middot;17 grms. (4 drachms); for cattle, 7&middot;04 grms. (2 drachms); for a dog
of the size and strength of a foxhound, 204 mgrms. (3 grains).</p>

<p>Enormous and otherwise fatal doses may be taken under certain conditions
by persons who are not opium-eaters. I have seen 13 cgrms.
(2 grains) of morphine acetate injected hypodermically in a strong man
suffering from rabies with but little effect. Tetanus, strychnine, convulsions,
and excessive pain all decrease the sensibility of the nervous
system to opium.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_351" id="Sect_351"></a>&sect; 351. <b>General Method for the Detection of Opium.</b>&mdash;It is usually
laid down in forensic works that, where poisoning by opium is suspected,
it is sufficient to detect the presence of meconic acid in order to establish
that of opium. In a case of adult poisoning there is generally substance
enough available to obtain one or more alkaloids, and the presence of
opium may, without a reasonable doubt, be proved, if meconic acid (as
well as either morphine, narcotine, thebaine, or other opium alkaloid)
has been detected. Pills containing either solid opium or the tincture
usually betray the presence of the drug by the odour, and in such a case
there can be no possible difficulty in isolating morphine and meconic
acid, with probably one or two other alkaloids. The method of extraction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
from organic fluids is the same as before described, but it may, of
course, be modified for any special purpose. If opium, or a preparation
of opium, be submitted to Dragendorff&#8217;s process (see <a href="#Page_242">p. 242</a>), the following
is a sketch of the chief points to be noticed.</p>

<p>If the solution is <i>acid</i><span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1.) <b>Benzene</b> mainly extracts <i>meconin</i>, which dissolves in sulphuric
acid very gradually (in twenty-four to forty-eight hours), with a green
colour passing into red. Meconin has no alkaloidal reaction.</p>

<p>(2.) <b>Amyl alcohol</b> dissolves small quantities of <i>meconic acid</i>, identified
by striking a blood-red colour with ferric chloride.</p>

<p>If now the amyl alcohol is removed with the aid of petroleum ether,
and the fluid made alkaline by ammonia<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1.) <b>Benzene</b> extracts <i>narcotine</i>, <i>codeine</i>, and <i>thebaine</i>. On evaporation
of the benzene the alkaloidal residue may be dissolved in water,
acidified with sulphuric acid, and after filtration, on adding ammonia <i>in
excess</i>, <i>thebaine and narcotine</i> are precipitated, <i>codeine</i> remaining in solution.
The dried precipitate, if it contain thebaine, becomes blood-red
when treated with cold concentrated sulphuric acid, while narcotine is
shown by a violet colour developing gradually when the substance is
dissolved in dilute sulphuric acid 1&nbsp;: 5, and gently warmed. The codeine
in the ammoniacal solution can be recovered by shaking up with benzene,
and recognised by the red colour which the solid substance gives when
treated with a little sugar and sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>(2.) <b>Chloroform</b> especially dissolves the <i>narceine</i>, which, on evaporation
of the chloroform, may be identified by its general characters, and
by its solution in Fr&ouml;hde&#8217;s reagent becoming a beautiful blue colour.
Small quantities of morphine may be extracted with codeine.</p>

<p>(3.) <b>Amyl alcohol</b> extracts from the alkaline solution morphine,
identified by its physical characters, by its forming a crystalline precipitate
with iodine and hydriodic acid, and the reaction with iodic acid to
be described.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_352" id="Sect_352"></a>&sect; 352. <b>Morphine</b> (<span class="chemform">C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>17</sub>NO(OH)<sub>2</sub></span> + <span class="chemform">H<sub>2</sub>O</span>).&mdash;Morphine occurs in commerce
as a white powder, sp. gr. 1&middot;205, usually in the form of more or
less perfect six-sided prisms, but sometimes in that of white silky needles.
When heated in the subliming cell (described at <a href="#Page_257">pp. 257-8</a>), faint nebul&aelig;,
resolved by high microscopic powers into minute dots, appear on the
upper disc at 150&deg;. As the temperature is raised the spots become
coarser, and at 188&deg; distinct crystals may be obtained, the best being
formed at nearly 200&deg;, at which temperature morphine begins distinctly
to brown, melt, and carbonise. At temperatures below 188&deg;, instead of
minute dots, the sublimate may consist of white circular spots or foliated
patterns. One part of morphine, according to P. Chastaing, is soluble
at a temperature of 3&deg; in 33,333 parts of water; at 22&deg;, in 4545 parts;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
at 42&deg;, 4280; and at 100&deg;, 4562. It is scarcely soluble in ether or
benzene. Absolute alcohol, according to Pettenkofer, dissolves in the
cold one-fortieth of its weight; boiling, one-thirtieth. Amyl alcohol, in
the cold, dissolves one-fourth per cent., and still more if the alkaloid be
thrown out of an aqueous acid solution by ammonia in the presence of
amyl alcohol; for under such circumstances the morphine has no time to
become crystalline. According to Schlimpert, 1 part of morphine requires
60 of chloroform for solution; according to Pettenkofer, 175.</p>

<p>Morphine is easily soluble in dilute acids, as well as in solutions of the
caustic alkalies and alkaline earths; carbonated alkalies and chloride of
ammonium also dissolve small quantities. The acid watery, and the
alcoholic solutions, turn the plane of polarisation to the left; for sulphuric,
nitric, and hydrochloric acids [&#945;]<i>r</i> = 89&middot;8&deg;; in alkaline solution the
polarisation is less, [&#945;]<i>r</i> = 45&middot;22&deg;. It is alkaline in reaction, neutralising
acids fully; and, in fact, a convenient method of titrating morphine is
by the use of a centinormal sulphuric acid&mdash;each c.c. equals 2&middot;85 mgrms.
of anhydrous morphine.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_353" id="Sect_353"></a>&sect; 353. The salts of morphine are for the most part crystalline, and are
all bitter, neutral, and poisonous. They are insoluble in amylic alcohol,
ether, chloroform, benzene, or petroleum ether.</p>

<p><b>Morphine meconate</b> is one of the most soluble of the morphine salts;
it is freely soluble in water. Of all salts this is most suitable for subcutaneous
injection; it is the form in which the alkaloid exists in
opium.</p>

<p><b>Morphine hydrochlorate</b> (<span class="chemform">C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>19</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>HCl</span>) crystallises in silky fibres;
it is readily soluble in alcohol, and is soluble in cold, more freely in
boiling water. The purest morphine hydrochlorate is colourless, but
that which is most frequently met with in commerce is fawn or buff-coloured.</p>

<p><b>Morphine acetate</b> is a crystallisable salt, soluble in water or alcohol;
it is in part decomposed by boiling the aqueous solution, some of the
acetic acid escaping.</p>

<p><b>Morphine Tartrates.</b>&mdash;These are readily soluble salts, and it is important
to note that the morphine might escape detection, if the expert
trusted alone to the usual test of an alkaloidal salt giving a precipitate
when the solution is alkalised by the fixed or volatile alkalies; for the
tartrates of morphine do not give this reaction, nor do they give any
precipitate with calcic chloride. By adding a solution of potassium
acetate in spirit, and also alcohol and a little acetic acid to the concentrated
solution, the tartrate is decomposed, and acid tartrate of potassium
is precipitated in the insoluble form; the morphine in the form of acetate
remains in solution, and then gives the usual reactions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>The solubility of morphine salts in water and alcohol has been investigated

<p><a name="Sect_354" id="Sect_354"></a>&sect; 354. <b>Constitution of Morphine.</b>&mdash;The chief facts bearing on the
constitution of morphine are as follows:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>It certainly contains two hydroxyl groups, because by the action of acetic
anhydride, acetyl morphine and diacetyl morphine, <span class="chemform">C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>18</sub>(CH<sub>3</sub>CO)NO<sub>3</sub></span>
and <span class="chemform">C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>17</sub>(CH<sub>3</sub>CO)<sub>2</sub>NO<sub>3</sub></span> are produced. The formation of the monomethyl
ether of morphine (codeine), <span class="chemform">C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>17</sub>(OH)(OCH<sub>3</sub>)NO</span>, is also a
testimony to the existence of hydroxyl groups. One of the hydroxyl
groups has phenolic functions, the other alcoholic functions. By suitable
oxidation morphine yields trinitrophenol (picric acid), and by fusion with
an alkali, protocatechuic acid; both of these reactions suggest a benzene
ring. On distilling with zinc dust phenanthrene, pyridine, pyrrol, trimethylamine,
and ammonia are formed; evidence of a pyridine nucleus.
If morphine is mixed with 10 to 15 times its weight of a 20 per cent.
solution of potash, and heated at 180&deg; for from four to six hours, air
being excluded, a phenol-like compound is formed, and a volatile amine,
ethylmethylamine (the amine boils at 34&deg; to 35&deg;, and its hydrochloride<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
melts at 133&deg;). This reaction is interpreted by Z. H. Skrauk<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> and L.
Wiegmann to indicate that the nitrogen is directly connected with two
alkyl groups&mdash;that is, ethyl and methyl.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_355" id="Sect_355"></a>&sect; 355. <b>Tests for Morphine.</b>&mdash;(1.) One hundredth of a milligrm. of
pure morphine gives a blue colour to a paste of ammonium molybdate
in sulphuric acid; 20 mgrms. of ammonium molybdate are rubbed with
a glass rod in a porcelain dish, and well mixed with 5 drops of pure
strong sulphuric acid and the morphine in a solid form applied; titanic
acid and tungstates give similar reactions.</p>

<p>(2.) Morphine possesses strong reducing properties; a little solid
morphine dissolved in a solution of ferric chloride gives a Prussian
blue precipitate when ferridcyanide solution is added. A number of
ptomaines and other substances also respond to this test, so that in itself
it is not conclusive.</p>

<p>(3.) <b>Iodic Acid Test.</b>&mdash;The substance supposed to be morphine is
converted into a soluble salt by adding to acid reaction a few drops of
hydrochloric acid, and then evaporating to dryness. The salt thus
obtained is dissolved in as little water as possible&mdash;this, as in toxicological
researches only small quantities are recovered, will probably
be but a few drops. A little of the solution is now mixed with a very
small quantity of starch paste, and evaporated to dryness at a gentle heat
in a porcelain dish. After cooling, a drop of a solution of 1 part of
iodic acid in 15 of water is added to the dry residue; and if even the
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>20000</sub> of a grain of morphine be present, a blue colour will be developed.</p>

<p>Another way of working the iodic acid test is to add the iodic acid
solution to the liquid in which morphine is supposed to be dissolved, and
then shake the liquid up with a few drops of carbon disulphide. If
morphine be present, the carbon disulphide floats to the top distinctly
coloured pink. Other substances, however, also set free iodine from
iodic acid, and it has, therefore, been proposed to distinguish morphine
from these by the after addition of ammonia. If ammonia is added to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
the solution, which has been shaken up with carbon disulphide, the pink
or red colour of the carbon disulphide is deepened, if morphine was
present; on the contrary, if morphine was <i>not</i> present, it is either
discharged or much weakened.</p>

<p><b>Other Reactions.</b>&mdash;There are some very interesting reactions besides
the two characteristic tests just mentioned. If a saturated solution of
chloride of zinc be added to a little solid morphine, and heated over the
water-bath for from fifteen minutes to half-an-hour, the liquid develops a
beautiful and persistent green colour. This would be an excellent test
for morphine were it not for the fact that the colour is produced with
only pure morphine. For example, I was unable to get the reaction from
morphine in very well-formed crystals precipitated from ordinary laudanum
by ammonia, the least trace of resinous or colouring-matter seriously interfering.
By the action of nitric acid on morphine, the liquid becomes
orange-red, and an acid product of the formula <span class="chemform">C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>9</sub>NO<sub>9</sub></span> is produced,
which, when heated in a closed tube with water at 100&deg;, yields trinitrophenol
or picric acid. This interesting reaction points very decidedly to
the phenolic character of morphine. On adding a drop of sulphuric acid
to solid morphine in the cold, the morphine solution becomes of a faint
pink; on gently warming and continuing the heat until the acid begins
to volatilise, the colour changes through a series of brownish and indefinite
hues up to black. On cooling and treating the black spot with
water, a green solution is obtained, agreeing in hue with the same
green produced by chloride of zinc. Vidali<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> has proposed the following
test:&mdash;Morphine is dissolved in strong sulphuric acid, and a little
arsenate of sodium is added; on gently warming, a passing blue colour
develops; on raising the temperature higher, the liquid changes into
green, then into blue, and finally again into green. Codeine acts very
similarly. The following test originated with Siebold (<i>American Journal
of Pharmacy</i>, 1873, p. 544):&mdash;The supposed morphine is heated gently
with a few drops of concentrated sulphuric acid and a little pure potassic
perchlorate. If morphine be present the liquid immediately takes a
pronounced brown colour&mdash;a reaction said to be peculiar to morphine,
and to succeed with <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub> of a mgrm. In order to obtain absolutely pure
perchlorate, potassic perchlorate is heated with hydrochloric acid so long
as it disengages chlorine; it is then washed with distilled water, dried,
and preserved for use. There is also a test known as &#8220;Pellagri&#8217;s&#8221;; it
depends on the production of apomorphine. The suspected alkaloid is
dissolved in a little strong hydrochloric acid, and then a drop of concentrated
sulphuric acid is added, and the mixture heated for a little
time from 100&deg; to 120&deg;, until it assumes a purple-black colour. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
now cooled, some hydrochloric acid again added, and the mixture
neutralised with sodic carbonate. If morphine be present, on the
addition of iodine in hydriodic acid, a cherry-red colour is produced,
passing into green. Morphine and codeine are believed alone to give
this reaction.</p>

<p>The acetate of morphine, and morphine itself, when added to ferric
chloride solution, develop a blue colour. When 1 molecule of morphine
is dissolved in alcohol, containing 1 molecule of sodium hydroxide, and
2 vols. of methyl iodide are added, and the mixture gently heated, a
violent reaction sets in and the main product is codeine methiodide
(<span class="chemform">C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>18</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>OCH,MeI</span>). If only half the quantity of methyl iodide is
added, then free codeine is in small quantity produced; if ethyl iodide be
substituted for methyl, a new base is formed homologous with codeine&mdash;codeine
is therefore the methyl ether of morphine. If morphine is
heated with iodide of methyl and absolute alcohol in a closed tube for
half an hour at 100&deg;, methyl iodide of morphine is obtained in colourless,
glittering, quadratic crystals, easily soluble in water (<span class="chemform">C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>19</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>MeI</span>
+ <span class="chemform">H<sub>2</sub>O</span>); similarly the ethyl iodide compound can be produced.</p>

with dilute hydrochloric acid, water is eliminated<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="chemreact">(C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>19</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> = C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>17</sub>NO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O),</p>

<p>and the hydrochlorate of apomorphine is produced. This succeeds when
even <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> mgrm. is heated with <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub> c.c. of strong <span class="chemform">HCl</span>, and the tests for
apomorphine applied.</p>

<p>If concentrated sulphuric acid be digested on morphine for twelve to
fifteen hours (or heated for half an hour at 100&deg;), on adding to the
cooled violet-coloured solution either a crystal of nitrate of potash or of
chlorate of potash, or a drop of dilute nitric acid, a beautiful violet-blue
colour is produced, which passes gradually into a dark blood-red.
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>100</sub> of a mgrm. will respond distinctly to this test. Fr&ouml;hde&#8217;s reagent
strikes with morphine a beautiful violet colour, passing from blue into
dirty green, and finally almost vanishing. <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>200</sub> of a mgrm. will respond
to the test, but it is not itself conclusive, since papaverine and certain
glucosides give an identical reaction.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_356" id="Sect_356"></a>&sect; 356. <b>Symptoms of Opium and Morphine Poisoning.</b>&mdash;The
symptoms of opium and morphine poisoning are so much alike, that
clinically it is impossible to distinguish them; therefore they may be
considered together.</p>

<p><b>Action on Animals&mdash;Frogs.</b>&mdash;The action of morphine or opium on
frogs is peculiar: the animal at first springs restlessly about, and then
falls into a condition extremely analogous to that seen in strychnine
poisoning, every motion or external irritation producing a tetanic convulsion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
This condition is, however, sometimes not observed. The
tetanic stage is followed by paralysis of reflex movements and cessation
of breathing, the heart continuing to beat.</p>

<p><b>Dogs.</b>&mdash;0&middot;2 to 0&middot;5 grm. of morphine meconate, or acetate, injected
directly into the circulation of a dog, shows its effects almost immediately.
The dog becomes uneasy, and moves its jaws and tongue as if some
peculiar taste were experienced; it may bark or utter a whine, and then
in a minute or two falls into a profound sleep, which is often so deep
that while it lasts&mdash;usually several hours&mdash;an operation may be performed.
In whatever attitude the limbs are placed, they remain. The
respiration is rapid and stertorous, and most reflex actions are extinguished.
Towards the end of the sleep, any sudden noise may startle
the animal, and when he wakes his faculties are evidently confused.
A partial paralysis of the hind legs has often been noticed, and then the
dog, with his tail and pelvis low, has something the attitude of the
hyena. Hence this condition (first, I believe, noticed by Bernard) has
been called the &#8220;hyenoid&#8221; state. If the dose is larger than 2 to 3 grms.
(31 to 46 grains), the symptoms are not dissimilar, save that they
terminate in death, which is generally preceded by convulsions.<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_381" id="Footnote_381"></a><a href="#FNanchor_381"><span class="label">[381]</span></a> MM. Grasset and Amblard have studied the action of morphine in
causing convulsions in the mammalia. They found that if small doses of
hydrochlorate of morphine (from 1 to 15 centigrammes) are administered
to dogs, the brief sleep which is produced may be accompanied by partial
muscular contractions (in one paw, for instance), which are renewed at
variable intervals. Then occur true convulsive shocks in the whole body
or in the hind limbs. After an interval, the phenomena recur in more
intense degree, and are followed by true convulsions. Regularly, ten or
sixteen times a minute, at each inspiration, the hind limbs present a
series of convulsive movements, which may become general. Sometimes they
are excited by external stimulation, but they are usually spontaneous.
The sleep may continue profound during this convulsive period, or it may
become distinctly lighter. These convulsive phenomena may continue, with
intervals, for an hour. Differences are observed with different animals;
but the chief characters of the phenomena are as described. In certain
animals, and with small doses, there may be a brief convulsive phase at
the commencement of the sleep, but it is much less constant than the
later period of spasm. These convulsions, the authors believe, have not
previously been described, except as a consequence of very large doses,
amounting to grammes. The period of cerebral excitement, described by
Claude Bernard as occurring at the commencement of the sleep from
morphine, is a phenomenon of a different order. The conclusions drawn
from the experiments are&mdash;(1) That morphia is not diametrically opposed
to thebaine, as is often stated, since it has, to a certain degree, the
convulsive properties of the latter alkaloid. (2) That the excitomotor
action of opium cannot be exclusively attributed to the convulsive
alkaloids, but is, in fact, due to those which are soporific. According
to the ordinary composition of opium, 5 centigrammes of morphine
represent about a milligramme of thebaine. But these experiments show
that the quantity of morphine has a much more powerful convulsive action
than a milligramme of thebaine. (3) There is not the supposed antagonism
between the action of morphine on the frog and on the mammalia. (4) The
researches hitherto undertaken on the antagonism between morphine and
other agents need to be repeated, and a separate study made of the
substances which antagonise the convulsive and soporific action.</p>

<p><b>Goats.</b>&mdash;According to Guinard, goats are proof against the narcotic
influence of morphine. Large doses kill goats, but death is caused by
interference with the respiratory function. A young goat weighing 30
kilos, showed little effect beyond a slightly increased cerebral excitability
after two doses of 8 and 8&middot;5 grms. respectively of morphine hydrochlorate
had been administered by intravenous injection, the second being
given an hour and a half after the first. To the same animal two days
afterwards 195 grms. were administered in the same way, yet the goat
recovered. The lethal dose for a goat seems to be no less than 1000
times that which will produce narcotism in man, and lies somewhere
between 0&middot;25 to 0&middot;30 per kilo. of the body weight.<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

<p><b>Cats and the Felid&aelig;.</b>&mdash;According to Guinard,<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> morphine injected
subcutaneously or intravenously into cats, in doses varying from 0&middot;4
mgrm. to 90 mgrms. per kilo., never produces sleep or narcotic prostration.
On the contrary, it causes a remarkable degree of excitement,
increasing in intensity with the dose given. This excitement is evidently
accompanied by disorder in the functions of the brain, and if the dose is
large convulsions set in, ending in death. According to Milne-Edwards,
the same symptoms are produced in lions and tigers.</p>

<p><b>Birds</b>, especially pigeons, are able to eat almost incredible quantities
of opium. A pigeon is said<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> to have consumed 801 grains of opium,
mixed with its food, in fourteen days. The explanation of this is that
the poison is not absorbed; for subcutaneous injections of salts of
morphine act rapidly on all birds hitherto experimented upon.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_357" id="Sect_357"></a>&sect; 357. <b>Physiological Action.</b>&mdash;From experiments on animals, the
essential action of morphine on the nervous and arterial systems has in
some measure been examined. There is no very considerable action on
the heart. The beats are first accelerated, then diminished in frequency;
but very large doses introduced directly into the circulation at once
diminish the pulsations, and no acceleration is noticed. The slowing
may go on to heart-paralysis. The slowing is central in its origin, for on
the vagi being cut, morphine always quickens. With regard to the
peripheric ends of the vagi, small doses excite, large paralyse. If all the
nerves going to the heart are divided, there is first a considerable acceleration,
and then a slowing and weakening of the pulsations. The arterial
blood-pressure, at first increased, is afterwards diminished. This increase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
of blood-pressure is noticed during the acceleration of the pulse, and also
during some portion of the time during which the pulse is slowed.
Stockman and D. B. Dott,<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> experimenting on rabbits and frogs, consider
that a medium dose of morphine first of all depresses the spinal cord and
then excites it, for tetanus follows. If morphine is in sufficient quantity
thrown into the circulation then tetanus at once occurs. It would thus
appear that depression and stimulation is entirely a matter of dosage.
Gescheidlen, in his researches on the frog, found the motor nerves at
first excited, and then depressed. When the doses were large, there was
scarcely any excitement, but the reverse effect, in the neighbourhood of
the place of application. According to other observers, the function of
the motor nerves may be annihilated.<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> According to Meihuizen, reflex
action, at first much diminished, is later, after several hours, normal, and
later still again increased. The intestinal movements are transitorily
increased. In the dog there has been noticed a greater flow of saliva than
usual, and the flow of bile from the gall-bladder is diminished. The
pupils in animals are mostly contracted, but, if convulsions occur towards
death, they are dilated.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_358" id="Sect_358"></a>&sect; 358. <b>Physiological Effect of Morphine Derivatives.</b>&mdash;By introducing
methyl, or amyl, or ethyl, into the morphine molecule, the narcotic
action is diminished, while the tetanic effects are increased. Acetyl,
diacetyl, benzoyl, and dibenzoyl morphine, morphine sulphuric ether, and
nitrosomorphine are all weaker narcotics than morphine, but, on the
other hand, they depress the functions of the spinal cord and bring on,
in large doses, tetanus.</p>

<p>The introduction of two methyl groups into morphine, as in metho-codeine,
<span class="chemform">C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>17</sub>MeNO(OH)-Me</span>, entirely alters the physiological
effect. This compound has an action on voluntary muscle causing
gradual paralysis.</p>

<p>The chlorine derivatives, trichlormorphine and chlorcodeine, have the
characteristic action of the morphine group on the central nervous system
and, in addition, act energetically as muscle poisons, soon destroying the
contractile power of the voluntary muscles with which they first come
into contact at the place of injection, and more gradually affecting the
other muscles of the body.<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

poisoning:&mdash;(1) <i>The common form</i>, as seen in about 99 per cent. of
cases; (2) A very <i>sudden form</i>, in which death takes place with fearful
rapidity (the <i>foudroyante</i> variety of the French);<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> and (3) a very rare

<p>In the <i>common form</i> there are three stages, viz.:&mdash;(1) Excitement;
(2) Narcosis; (3) Coma. In from half an hour to an hour<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> the first
symptoms commence, the pulse is quickened, the pupils are contracted,
the face flushes, and the hands and feet reddened,&mdash;in other words, the
capillary circulation is active. This stage has some analogy to the action
of alcohol; the ideas mostly flow with great rapidity, and instead of a
feeling of sleepiness, the reverse is the case. It, however, insensibly,
and more or less rapidly, passes into the next stage of heaviness and stupor.
There is an irresistible tendency to sleep; the pulse and the respiration
become slower; the conjunctiv&aelig; are reddened; the face and head often
flushed. In some cases there is great irritability of the skin, and an
eruption of nettle-rash. If the poison has been taken by the mouth,
vomiting may be present. The bowels are usually&mdash;in fact almost invariably&mdash;constipated.
There is also some loss of power over the bladder.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_389" id="Footnote_389"></a><a href="#FNanchor_389"><span class="label">[389]</span></a> In a remarkable case related by Taylor, a lady took a large dose
(supposed to be 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> oz.) of laudanum, and there were no symptoms for
four and a half hours. She died in twenty-two hours.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>In the next stage, the narcosis deepens into dangerous coma; the
patient can no longer be roused by noises, shaking, or external stimuli;
the breathing is loud and stertorous; the face often pale; the body
covered with a clammy sweat. The pupils are still contracted, but they
may in the last hours of life dilate: and it is generally agreed that, if a
corpse is found with the pupils dilated, this circumstance, taken in itself,
does not contra-indicate opium or morphine poisoning. Death occasionally
terminates by convulsion.</p>

<p>The <i>sudden form</i> is that in which the individual sinks into a deep
sleep almost immediately&mdash;that is, within five or ten minutes&mdash;and dies
in a few hours. In these rapid cases the pupils are said to be constantly
dilated.</p>

<p>Examples of the <i>convulsive form</i> are to be sought among opium-eaters,
or persons under otherwise abnormal conditions.</p>

<p>A man, forty years old, who had taken opiates daily since his twenty-second
year&mdash;his dose being 6 grms. (92&middot;4 grains) of solid opium&mdash;when
out hunting, of which sport he was passionately fond, took cold, and,
as a remedy, administered to himself three times his accustomed dose.
Very shortly there was contraction of the left arm, disturbance of vision,
pain in the stomach, faintness, inability to speak, and unconsciousness
which lasted half an hour. Intermittent convulsions now set in, and
pains in the limbs. There was neither somnolence nor delirium, but
great agitation; repeated vomiting and diarrh&#339;a followed. After five
hours these symptoms ceased; but he was excessively prostrate.<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> There
was complete recovery.</p>

<p>One may hazard a surmise that, in such a case, tolerance has been
established for morphine, but not for other morphine alkaloids in the
same degree, and that the marked nervous symptoms were in no small
degree the effect of some of the homologous alkaloids, which, in such an
enormous dose, would be taken in sufficient quantity to have a physiological
action.</p>

<p>There are several instances of a relapsing or remittent form of poisoning&mdash;a
form in which the patient more or less completely recovers consciousness,
and then sinks back into a fatal slumber. One of the best known is
the case of the Hon. Mrs Anson (January 1859), who swallowed an
ounce and a half of laudanum by mistake. After remaining in a comatose
condition for more than nine hours, she revived. The face became
natural, the pulse steady. She was able to recognise her daughter, and
in a thick voice to give an account of the mistake. But this lasted only
ten minutes, when she again became comatose, and died in fourteen
hours.<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p>

<p>In a Swedish case quoted by Maschka,<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> a girl, nine years old, in weak
health and suffering from slight bronchitis, had been given a non-officinal
acetate of morphia lozenge, which was supposed to contain 5 mgrms.
(&middot;075 grain) of morphine acetate. She took the lozenge at eight in the
evening; soon slept, woke at ten, got out of bed, laughed, talked, and
joked with the nurse, again got into bed, and very quickly fell asleep.
At four <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span> the nurse came and found her breathing with a rattling
sound, and the physician, who arrived an hour later, found the girl in a
state of coma, with contracted pupils, breathing stertorously, and the
pulse scarcely to be felt. Despite all attempts to rouse the patient, she
died at eight in the morning, twelve hours after taking the lozenge.</p>

<p>The <i>post-mortem</i> examination showed some hyper&aelig;mia of the brain
and serous effusion in the ventricles, and there was also tubercle in the
pleura. Three lozenges similar to the one taken by the patient were
chemically investigated by Hamberg, who found that the amount of
acetate was very small, and that the lozenges, instead of morphine
acetate, might be considered as prepared with almost pure morphine;
the content in the three of morphine being respectively 35, 37, and
42 mgrms. (that is, from half a grain to three-fifths of a grain). There
was a difference of opinion among the experts as to whether in this case
the child died from morphine poisoning or not&mdash;a difference solely to be
attributed to the waking up of the child two hours after taking the poison.
Now, considering the great probability that a large dose for a weakly child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
of that age had been taken, and that this is not the only case in which a
relapse has occurred, it seems just to infer that it was really a case of
poisoning.</p>

<p>As unusual symptoms (or rather sequel&aelig;) may be noted in a few cases,
hemiplegia, which soon passes off; a weakness of the lower extremities
may also be left, and inability to empty the bladder thoroughly; but
usually on recovery from a large dose of opium, there is simply heaviness
of the head, a dry tongue, constipation, and loss of appetite. All these
symptoms in healthy people vanish in a day or two. There have also
been noticed slight albuminuria, eruptions on the skin, loss of taste, and
numbness of parts of the body.</p>

<p>Opium, whether taken in substance, or still more by subcutaneous
injection, in some individuals constantly causes faintness. In my own
case, I have several times taken a single grain of opium to relieve either
pain or a catarrh; almost invariably within an hour afterwards there has
been great coldness of the hands and feet, lividity of the face, a feeling
of deadly faintness followed by vomiting; this stage (which has seldom
lasted more than half an hour) passed, the usual narcotic effects have
been produced.</p>

<p>Some years ago I injected one-sixth of a grain of morphine hydrochlorate
subcutaneously into an old gentleman, who was suffering from
acute lumbago, but was otherwise healthy, and had no heart disease
which could be detected; the malady was instantly relieved, and he
called out, &#8220;I am well; it is most extraordinary.&#8221; He went out of
the front door, and walked some fifty yards, and then was observed to
reel about like a drunken man. He was supported back and laid in the
horizontal posture; the face was livid, the pulse could scarcely be felt,
and there was complete loss of consciousness. This state lasted about
an hour, and without a doubt the man nearly died. Medical men in
practice, who have been in the habit of using hypodermic injections of
morphine, have had experiences very similar to this and other cases, and
although I know of no actual death, yet it is evident that morphine,
when injected hypodermically even in a moderate dose, may kill by
syncope, and within a few minutes.<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> Absorption by hypodermic administration
is so rapid that by the time, or even before the needle of the
syringe is withdrawn, a contraction of the pupil may be observed.</p>

<p>Opium or morphine is poisonous by whatever channel it gains access

narcotic effects may be produced by external applications, whether a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>

related in Chevers&#8217;s <i>Jurisprudence</i>.<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> A Burman boy, about nine or ten
years of age, was struck on the forehead by a brick-bat, causing a gaping
wound about an inch long; his parents stuffed the wound with opium.
On the third day after the accident, and the opium still remaining in the
wound, he became semi-comatose, and, in short, had all the symptoms of
opium narcosis; with treatment he recovered. The unbroken skin also
readily absorbs the drug. Tardieu states that he had seen 30 grms. of
laudanum, applied on a poultice to the abdomen, produce death. Christison
has also cited a case in which a soldier suffered from erysipelas, and
died in a narcotic state, apparently produced from the too free application
of laudanum to the inflamed part.</p>

<p>To these cases may be added the one cited by Taylor, in which a
druggist applied 30 grains of morphine to the surface of an ulcerated
breast, and the woman died with all the symptoms of narcotic poisoning
ten hours after the application&mdash;an event scarcely surprising. It is a
curious question whether sufficient of the poison enters into the secretions&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>,
the milk&mdash;to render it poisonous. An inquest was held in
Manchester, Nov. 1875, on the body of a male child two days old, in
which it seemed probable that death had occurred through the mother&#8217;s
milk. She was a confirmed opium-eater, taking a solid ounce per week.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_360" id="Sect_360"></a>&sect; 360. <b>Diagnosis of Opium Poisoning.</b>&mdash;The diagnosis is at times
between poisoning by opium or other narcotic substances, at others,
between opium and disease. Insensibility from chloral, from alcohol,
from belladonna or atropine, and from carbon oxide gas, are all more or
less like opium poisoning. With regard to chloral, it may be that only
chemical analysis and surrounding circumstances can clear up the matter.
In alcohol poisoning, the breath commonly smells very strongly of
alcohol, and there is no difficulty in separating it from the contents of
the stomach, &amp;c., besides which the stomach is usually red and inflamed.
Atropine and belladonna invariably dilate the pupil, and although just
before death opium has the same effect, yet we must hold that mostly
opium contracts, and that a widely-dilated pupil during life would, <i>per se</i>,
lead us to suspect that opium had not been used, although, as before
mentioned, too much stress must not be laid upon the state of the pupils.
In carbon oxide, the peculiar rose-red condition of the body affords a
striking contrast to the pallor which, for the most part, accompanies
opium poisoning. In the rare cases in which convulsions are a prominent
symptom, it may be doubtful whether opium or strychnine has been taken,
but the convulsions hitherto noticed in opium poisoning seem to me to
have been rather of an epileptiform character, and very different from the
effects of strychnine. No rules can be laid down for cases which do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
run a normal course; in medicine such are being constantly met with, and
require all the care and acumen of the trained observer. Cases of disease
render a diagnosis often extremely difficult, and the more so in those
instances in which a dose of laudanum or other opiate has been administered.
In a case under my own observation, a woman, suffering
from emphysema and bronchitis, sent to a chemist for a sleeping draught,
which she took directly it arrived. A short time afterwards she fell into
a profound slumber, and died within six hours. The draught had been
contained in an ounce-and-a-half bottle; the bottle was empty, and the
druggist stated in evidence that it only contained 20 minims of laudanum,
10 grains of potassic bromide, and water. On, however, diluting the
single drop remaining in the bottle, and imitating its colour with several
samples of laudanum diluted in the same way, I came to the conclusion
that the quantity of laudanum which the bottle originally contained was
far in excess of that which had been stated, and that it was over
1 drachm and under 2 drachms. The body was pallid, the pupils
strongly contracted, the vessels of the brain membranes were filled with
fluid blood, and there was about an ounce of serous fluid in each
ventricle. The lungs were excessively emphysematous, and there was
much secretion in the bronchi; the liver was slightly cirrhotic. The
blood, the liver, and the contents of the stomach were exhaustively
analysed with the greatest care, but no trace of morphine, narcotine, or
meconic acid could be separated, although the woman did not live more
than six hours after taking the draught. I gave the opinion that it was,
in the woman&#8217;s state, improper to prescribe a sedative of that kind, and
that probably death had been accelerated, if not directly caused, by
opium.</p>

<p>Deaths by apoplexy will only simulate opium-poisoning during life;
a <i>post-mortem</i> examination will at once reveal the true nature of the
malady. In epilepsy, however, it is different, and more than once an
epileptic fit has occurred and been followed by coma&mdash;a coma which
certainly cannot be distinguished from that produced by a narcotic
poison. Death in this stage may follow, and on examining the body no
lesion may be found.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_361" id="Sect_361"></a>&sect; 361. <b>Opium-eating.</b>&mdash;The consumption of opium is a very ancient
practice among Eastern nations, and the picture, drawn by novelist and
traveller, of poor, dried-up, yellow mortals addicted to this vice, with
their faculties torpid, their skin hanging in wrinkles on their wasted
bodies, the conjunctiv&aelig; tinged with bile, the bowels so inactive that
there is scarcely an excretion in the course of a week, the mental faculties
verging on idiocy and imbecility, is only true of a percentage of those
who are addicted to the habit. In the <i>British Medical Journal</i> for
1894, Jan. 13 and 20, will be found a careful digest of the evidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
collated from 100 Indian medical officers, from which it appears that opium
is taken habitually by a very large number of the population throughout
India, those who are accustomed to the drug taking it in quantities of
from 10 to 20 grains in the twenty-four hours; so long as this amount
is not exceeded they do not appear to suffer ill-health or any injurious
effect. The native wrestlers even use it whilst training. The habitual
consumption of opium by individuals has a direct medico-legal bearing.
Thus in India, among the Rajpoots, from time immemorial, infused
opium has been the drink both of reconciliation and of ordinary greeting,
and it is no evidence of death by poison if even a considerable quantity
of opium be found in the stomach after death, for this circumstance
taken alone would, unless the history of the case was further known, be
considered insufficient proof. So, again, in all climates, and among all
races, it is entirely unknown what quantity of an opiate should be considered
a poisonous dose for an opium-eater. Almost incredible quantities
have, indeed, been consumed by such persons, and the commonly-received
explanation, that the drug, in these cases, passes out unabsorbed,
can scarcely be correct, for Hermann mentions the case of a lady of
Zurich who daily injected subcutaneously 1 to 2 grms. (15-31 grains) of a
morphine salt. In a case of uterine cancer, recorded by Dr. W. C. Cass,<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>
20 grains of morphine in the twelve hours were frequently used subcutaneously;
during thirteen months the hypodermic syringe was used
1350 times, the dose each time being 5 grains. It is not credible that
an alkaloid introduced into the body hypodermically should not be
absorbed.</p>

<p>Opium-smoking is another form in which the drug is used, but it is
an open question as to what poisonous alkaloids are in opium smoke. It
is scarcely probable that morphine should be a constituent, for its subliming
point is high, and it will rather be deposited in the cooler portion
of the pipe. Opium, specially prepared for smoking, is called &#8220;Chandoo&#8221;;
it is dried at a temperature not exceeding 240&deg;. H. Moissan<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> has
investigated the products of smoking chandoo, but only found a small
quantity of morphine. N. Gr&eacute;hant and E. Martin<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> have also experimented
with opium smoke; they found it to have no appreciable effect
on a dog; one of the writers smoked twenty pipes in succession, containing
altogether 4 grms. of chandoo. After the fourth pipe there was
some headache, at the tenth pipe and onwards giddiness. Half an hour
after the last pipe the giddiness and headache rapidly went off. In any
case, opium-smoking seems to injure the health of Asiatics but little.
Mr. Vice-Consul King, of Kew-Kiang, in a tour through Upper Yangtse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
and Stechnan, was thrown much into the company of junk sailors and
others, &#8220;almost every adult of whom smoked more or less.&#8221; He says:&mdash;&#8220;Their
work was of the hardest and rudest, rising at four and working
with hardly any intermission till dark, having constantly to strip and
plunge into the stream in all seasons, and this often in the most
dangerous parts. The quantity of food they eat was simply prodigious,
and from this and their work it seems fairly to be inferred that their
constitution was robust. The two most addicted to the habit were the
pilot and the ship&#8217;s cook. On the incessant watchfulness and steady
nerve of the former the safety of the junk and all on board depended,
while the second worked so hard from 3 <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span> to 10 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span>, and often
longer, and seemed so independent of sleep or rest, that to catch him
seated or idle was sufficient cause for good-humoured banter. This
latter had a conserve of opium and sugar which he chewed during the
day, as he was only able to smoke at night.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="Sect_362" id="Sect_362"></a>&sect; 362. <b>Treatment of Opium or Morphine Poisoning.</b>&mdash;The first
thing to be done is doubtless to empty the stomach by means of the
flexible stomach tube; the end of a sufficiently long piece of indiarubber
tubing is passed down into the pharynx and allowed to be carried into
the stomach by means of the natural involuntary movements of the
muscles of the pharynx and gullet; suction is then applied to the free
end and the contents syphoned out; the stomach is, by means of a
funnel attached to the tube, washed out with warm water, and then
some coffee administered in the same way.</p>

<p>Should morphine have been taken, and permanganate of potash be at
hand, it has been shown that under such circumstances potassic permanganate
is a perfect antidote, decomposing at once any morphine
remaining in the stomach, but it, of course, will have no effect upon any
morphine which has already been absorbed. In a case of opium poisoning,
reported in the <i>Lancet</i> of June 2, 1894, by W. J. C. Merry, M.B.,
inhalations of oxygen, preceded by emptying the stomach and other
means, appeared to save a man, who, three hours before the treatment,
had drank 2 ozs. of chlorodyne. It is also the received treatment
to ward off the fatal sleep by stimulation; the patient is walked about,
flicked with a towel, made to smell strong ammonia, and so forth. This
stimulation must, however, be an addition, but must never replace the
measures first detailed.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_363" id="Sect_363"></a>&sect; 363. <b>Post-mortem Appearances.</b>&mdash;There are no characteristic
appearances after death save hyper&aelig;mia of the brain and blood-vessels of
the membranes, with generally serous effusion into the ventricles. The
pupils are sometimes contracted, sometimes dilated, the dilatation occurring,
as before mentioned, in the act of dying. The external surface
of the body is either livid or pale. The lungs are commonly hyper&aelig;mic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
the bladder full of urine; still, in not a few cases, there is nothing
abnormal, and in no single case could a pathologist, from the appearance
of the organs only, declare the cause of death with confidence.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_364" id="Sect_364"></a>&sect; 364. <b>Separation of Morphine from Animal Tissues and Fluids.</b>&mdash;Formerly
a large proportion of the opium and morphine cases submitted
to chemical experts led to no results; but owing to the improved processes
now adopted, failure, though still common, is less frequent. The constituents
of opium taken into the blood undergo partial destruction in
the animal body, but a portion may be found in the secretions, more
especially in the urine and f&aelig;ces. First Bouchardat<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> and then Lefort<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a>
ascertained the excretion of morphine by the urine after medicinal doses;
Dragendorff and Kauzmann showed that the appearance of morphine in
the urine was constant, and that it could be easily ascertained and
separated from the urine of men and animals; and Levinstein<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> has also
shown that the elimination from a single dose may extend over five or
six days. The method used by Dragendorff to extract morphine from
either urine or blood is to shake the liquid (acidified with a mineral
acid) several times with amyl alcohol, which, on removal, separates urea
and any bile acids. The liquid thus purified is then alkalised, and
shaken up with amyl alcohol, and this amyl alcohol should contain any
morphine that was present. On evaporation it may be pure enough to
admit of identification, but if not, it may be redissolved and purified on
the usual principles. Considerable variety of results seems to be obtained
by different experimenters. Landsberg<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> injected hypodermically doses
of &middot;2 to &middot;4 grm. of morphine hydrochlorate into dogs, making four
experiments in all, but failed to detect morphine in the urine. A large
dose with 2&middot;4 mgrms. of the salt gave the same result. On the other
hand, &middot;8 grm. of morphine hydrochlorate injected direct into the jugular
vein, was partly excreted by the kidneys, for 90 c.c. of the urine yielded
a small quantity of morphine. Voit, again, examined the urine and
f&aelig;ces of a man who had taken morphine for years; he could detect none
in the urine, but separated morphine from the f&aelig;ces.<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> Morphine may
occasionally be recognised in the blood. Dragendorff<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> found it in the
blood of a cat twenty-five minutes after a subcutaneous dose, and he also
separated it from the blood of a man who died of morphine poisoning in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
six hours. Haidlen<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> recognised morphine in the blood of a suicide who
had taken opium extract.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>On the other hand, in a case recorded at <a href="#Page_304">p. 304</a>, where a woman died
in six hours from a moderate dose, probably of laudanum, although the
quantity of blood operated upon was over a pound in weight, and every
care was taken, the results were entirely negative. In poisoning by
laudanum there may be some remaining in the stomach, and also if
large doses of morphine have been taken by the mouth; but when morphine
has been administered hypodermically, and in all cases in which
several hours have elapsed, one may almost say that the organ in which
there is the least probability of finding the poison is the stomach. It
may, in some cases, be necessary to operate on a very large scale;&mdash;to
examine the f&aelig;ces, mince up the whole liver, the kidney, spleen, and
lungs, and treat them with acid alcohol. The urine will also have to be
examined, and as much blood as can be obtained. In cases where all
the evidence points to a minute quantity (under a grain) of morphine, it
is decidedly best to add these various extracts together, to distil off the
alcohol at a very gentle heat, to dry the residue in a vacuum, to dissolve
again in absolute alcohol, filter, evaporate again to dryness, dissolve in
water, and then use the following process:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p><a name="Sect_365" id="Sect_365"></a>&sect; 365. <b>Extraction of Morphine.</b>&mdash;To specially search for morphine in
such a fluid as the urine, it is, according to the author&#8217;s experience, best
to proceed strictly as follows:&mdash;The urine is precipitated with acetate of
lead, the powdered lead salt being added to the warm urine contained in
a beaker on the water-bath, until a further addition no longer produces a
precipitate; the urine is then filtered, the lead precipitate washed, and
the excess of lead thrown down by <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>; the lead having been filtered
off, and the precipitate washed, the urine is concentrated down to a syrup
in a vacuum. The syrup is now placed in a separating tube (if not acid,
it is acidified with hydrochloric acid), and shaken up successively with
petroleum ether, chloroform, ether, and, lastly, with amylic alcohol (the
latter should be warm); finally, the small amount of amylic alcohol left
dissolved in the liquid is got rid of by shaking it up with petroleum
ether. To get rid of the last traces of petroleum ether, it may be necessary
to turn the liquid into an evaporating dish, and gently heat for a
little time over the water-bath. The acid liquid is now again transferred
to the separating tube, and shaken up with ether, after being made
alkaline with ammonia; this will remove nearly all alkaloids save morphine,&mdash;under
the circumstances, a very small quantity of morphine may
indeed be taken up by the ether, but not the main bulk. After separating
the ether, the liquid is again made slightly acid, so as to be able to precipitate
morphine in the presence of the solvent; the tube is warmed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
the water-bath, at least its own bulk of hot amylic alcohol added and the
liquid made alkaline, and the whole well shaken. The amylic alcohol is
removed in the usual way, and shaken with a small quantity of decinormal
sulphuric acid; this washes out the alkaloid from the amyl alcohol, and the
same amyl alcohol can be used again and again. It is best to extract the
liquid for morphine at least thrice, and to operate with both the solution
and the amyl hot. The decinormal acid liquid is made slightly alkaline
with ammonia, and allowed to stand for at least twelve hours; any precipitate
is collected and washed with ether, and then with water; the
alkaline liquid from which the morphine has been separated is concentrated
to the bulk of 5 c.c. on the water bath, and again allowed to stand
for twelve hours; a little more morphine may often in this way be obtained.</p>

<p>The author in some test experiments, in which weighed small
quantities of morphine (60-80 mgrms.) were dissolved in a little decinormal
sulphuric acid, and added to large quantities of urine, found the
process given to yield from 80 to 85 per cent. of the alkaloid added, and
it was always recovered in fine crystals of a slight brown tint, which
responded well to tests.</p>

<p>Various other methods were tried, but the best was the one given;
the method not only separates the alkaloid with but little loss, but also
in a sufficiently pure state to admit of identification.</p>

<p>From the tissues the alkaloid may be dissolved out by the general
method given at <a href="#Page_239">p. 239</a>, and the ultimate aqueous solution, reduced to a
bulk of not more than 25 c.c., treated by the ethereal solvents in the
way just described.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_366" id="Sect_366"></a>&sect; 366. <b>Narcotine</b> (<span class="chemform">C<sub>22</sub>H<sub>23</sub>NO<sub>7</sub></span>) crystallises out of alcohol or ether in
colourless, transparent, glittering needles, or groups of needles, belonging
to the orthorhombic system.</p>

<p>It is only slightly soluble in boiling, and almost insoluble in cold
water. One part requires 100 parts of cold, and 20 of boiling 84 per
cent. alcohol; 126 parts of cold, 48 of boiling ether (specific gravity
0&middot;735); 2&middot;69 parts of chloroform; 400 of olive oil; 60 of acetic ether;
300 of amyl alcohol; and 22 parts of benzene, for solution. The neutral
solution of narcotine turns the plane of polarisation to the left [&#945;]<i>r</i> = 130&middot;6;
the acid solution to the right. Narcotine has no effect on red litmus
paper.</p>

<p>Narcotine gives no crystalline sublimate; its behaviour in the subliming
cell is described at <a href="#Page_259">p. 259</a>. Its melting-point, taken in a tube, is
about 176&deg;.</p>

<p><b>Behaviour of Narcotine with Reagents.</b>&mdash;Narcotine, dissolved in
dilute hydrochloric acid, and then treated with a little bromine, gives a
yellow precipitate, which on boiling is dissolved; by gradually adding
solution of bromine and boiling, a fine rose colour is produced, readily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
destroyed by excess of bromine. This is perhaps the best test for the
presence of narcotine. Concentrated sulphuric acid dissolves narcotine;
the solution in the cold is at first colourless, after a few minutes yellow,
and in the course of a day or longer the tints gradually deepen. If the
solution is warmed, it first becomes orange-red, then at the margin violet-blue;
and if heated until hydric sulphate begins to volatilise, the colour
is an intense red-violet. If the heating is not carried so far, but the
solution allowed to cool, a delicate cherry-red hue slowly develops. If
the sulphuric acid solution contains 1&nbsp;: 2000 of the alkaloid, this test is
very evident; with 1&nbsp;: 40,000, the colour is only a faint carmine.&mdash;<i>A.
Husemann.</i></p>

<p>A solution of narcotine in pure sulphuric acid, to which a drop of
nitric acid has been added, becomes of a red colour; if the solution is
warmed to 150&deg;, hypochlorite of soda develops a carmine-red; and
chloride of iron, first a violet, then a cherry-red. The precipitants of
narcotine are&mdash;phosphomolybdic acid, picric acid, sulphocyanide of
potash, potassio cadmic iodide, mercuric chloride, platinic chloride,
auric chloride, and several other reagents.</p>

<p>From the brown mass left after heating narcotine above 200&deg;, hydrochloric
acid extracts a small portion of a base but little studied. The
residue consists of humopic acid (<span class="chemform">C<sub>40</sub>H<sub>19</sub>O<sub>14</sub></span>), which can be obtained by
dissolving in caustic potash, precipitating with <span class="chemform">HCl</span>, dissolving the precipitate
in boiling alcohol, and finally throwing it down by water.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_367" id="Sect_367"></a>&sect; 367. <b>Effects.</b>&mdash;Narcotine in itself has toxic action only in rather
large doses; from 1 to 2 grms. have been given to man, and slight
hypnotic effects have followed. It is poisonous in very large doses; an

<p><a name="Sect_368" id="Sect_368"></a>&sect; 368. <b>Codeine</b> (<b>Codomethylene</b>), <span class="chemform">C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>17</sub>OCH<sub>3</sub>(OH)NO</span> + <span class="chemform">H<sub>2</sub>O</span>, is the
methyl of morphine; it is an alkaloid contained in opium in small quantity
only. Mulder, indeed, quotes &middot;66 to &middot;77 per cent. as present in Smyrna
opium, but Merck and Schindler give &middot;25 per cent. Schindler found in
Constantinople, &middot;5 per cent.; and Merck, in Bengal, &middot;5 per cent. also.</p>

<p>Codeine crystallises out of dry ether in small, colourless, anhydrous,
crystals; but crystallised slowly from an aqueous solution, the crystals
are either in well-defined octahedra, or in prisms, containing one atom of
water, and melting in boiling-water to an oily fluid. The anhydrous
crystals have a melting-point of 150&deg;, and solidify again on cooling. Its
watery solution is alkaline to litmus paper.</p>

<p>It requires 80 parts of cold, 17 of boiling water, 10 parts of benzole,
and 7 parts of amyl alcohol respectively, for solution. Alcohol, benzene,
ether, carbon disulphide, and chloroform freely dissolve it, but in
petroleum ether it is almost insoluble. Further, it is also soluble in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
aqueous ammonia, and in dilute acids, but insoluble in excess of caustic
potash or soda, and may thus be thrown out of an aqueous solution. A
solution of codeine turns the plane of polarisation to the left, [&#945;]<i>r</i> =
118&middot;2&deg;.</p>

<p>Concentrated sulphuric acid dissolves codeine without colour, but after
eight days the solution becomes blue; this reaction is quicker if the acid
contains a trace of nitric acid. If the sulphuric acid solution be warmed
to 150&deg;, and a drop of nitric acid be added after cooling, a blood-red
colour is produced. Fr&ouml;hde&#8217;s reagent produces a dirty green colour, soon
becoming Prussian blue, and terminating after twenty-four hours in a
pale yellow.</p>

<p>Cyanogen gas, led into an alcoholic solution of codeine, gives first a
yellow and then a brown colour; lastly, a crystalline precipitate falls.
On warming with a little sulphuric acid and ferric chloride, a blue colour
is produced. This blue colour is apparently common to all ethers of the
codeine class.</p>

<p>Of the group reagents, the following precipitate solutions of codeine:&mdash;Mercuric
potassium iodide, mercuric chloride, mercuric bromide, picric
acid, and tannin solutions. The following do not precipitate:&mdash;Mercuric
cyanide and potassium ferrocyanide solutions. Potassium dichromate gives
no immediate precipitate, but crystals form on long standing. It does not
give the reaction with iodic acid like morphine; it is distinguished from
narceine by dropping a small particle of iodine into the aqueous solution,
the iodine particle does not become surrounded with fine crystals.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_369" id="Sect_369"></a>&sect; 369. <b>Effects.</b>&mdash;The physiological action of codeine on animals has
been investigated by Claude Bernard, Magendie, Crum Brown and Fraser,
Falck, and a large number of others.<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> It has also been administered to
man, and has taken in some degree the place of morphine. Claude
Bernard showed that, when given to dogs in sufficient quantity to produce
sleep, the sleep was different in some respects to that of morphine
sleep, especially in its after-effects. Thus, in his usual graphic way, he
describes the following experiment:&mdash;&#8220;Two young dogs, accustomed to
play together, and both a little beyond the average size, received in the
cellular tissue of the axill&aelig;, by the aid of a subcutaneous syringe, the
one 5 centigrammes of morphine hydrochloride, the other 5 centigrammes
of codeine hydrochloride. At the end of a quarter of an hour both dogs
showed signs of narcosis. They were placed on their backs in the
experimental trough, and slept tranquilly for three or four hours. When
the animals woke, they presented the most striking contrast. The
morphine dog ran with a hyena-like gait (<i>d&eacute;marche hy&eacute;noid</i>), the eye
wild, recognising no one, not even his codeine comrade, who vainly bit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
him playfully, and jumped sportively on his back. It was not until the
next day that the morphine dog regained his spirits and usual humour.
A couple of days after, the two dogs being in good health, I repeated the
same experiment, but in an inverse order&mdash;that is to say, I gave the
codeine to that which previously had the morphine, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. Both
dogs slept about as long as the first time; but on waking the attitudes
were completely reversed, just as the administration of the two substances
had been. The dog which, two days before, after having been codeinised,
woke lively and gay, was now bewildered and half paralysed at the end
of his morphine sleep; whilst the other was wide awake and in the best
spirits.&#8221;</p>

<p>Subsequent experimenters found what Bernard does not mention&mdash;viz.,
that codeine produced epileptiform convulsions. Falck made some very
careful experiments on pigeons, frogs, and rabbits. To all these in high
enough doses it was fatal. Falk puts the minimum lethal dose for a
rabbit at 51&middot;2 mgrms. per kilo. Given to man, it produces a sleep very
similar to that described by Claude Bernard&mdash;that is, a sleep which is
very natural, and does not leave any after-effect. Therefore it is declared
to be the best alkaloid of a narcotic nature to give when lengthened
slumber is desired, more especially since it does not confine the bowels,
nor has it been found to produce any eruption on the skin. Before it
has a full narcotic effect, vomiting has often been excited, and in a few
cases purging. The maximum dose for an adult is about &middot;1 grm. (1&middot;5
grain); three times this quantity, &middot;3 grms. (4-5 grains), would probably
produce unpleasant, if not dangerous, symptoms.<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p>

<p>It therefore contains three methoxyl groups.</p>

<p>Narceine forms good crystals, the form being that of long, four-sided rhombic
prisms or fine bushy united needles.</p>

<p>Narceine hydrochloride crystallises with <span class="chemform">5<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</span> and with <span class="chemform">3H<sub>2</sub>O</span>; the anhydrous
salt melts at 190&deg;-192&deg;. The platinochloride is a definite salt, m.p. 190&deg;-191&deg;; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"><span class="fsize110">[313]</span></a></span>
decomposes at 195&deg;-196&deg;. The nitrate forms good crystals, which decompose at 97&deg;.
Narceine also forms crystalline salts with potassium and sodium; these may be
obtained by heating the base at 60&deg;-70&deg; with a 33 per cent. of <span class="chemform">NaHO</span> or
<span class="chemform">KHO</span>.</p>

<p>The potassium compound melts at 90&deg;, the sodium at 159&deg;-160&deg;. The alkaloid is
regenerated when the alkali salts are treated with acids or with <span class="chemform">CO<sub>2</sub></span>. Crude narceine
may be purified by means of the sodium salt; the latter is dissolved in alcohol and
precipitated with ether.</p>

<p>It is soluble in alcohol, but almost insoluble in alcohol and ether, or benzene and
ether; it is slightly soluble in ether, carbon disulphide, and chloroform. It has no
reaction on moist litmus paper.</p>

<p>Benzole and petroleum ether extract narceine neither from acid nor alkaline solutions;
chloroform extracts narceine both from acid and from alkaline solutions, the
latter in small proportion only. Narceine turns the plane of polarisation to the left,
[&#945;]<i>r</i> = 66&middot;7&deg;. Narceine may be separated from narcotine by the addition of ammonia
to the acid aqueous solution; narcotine is fully precipitated by ammonia, but narceine
is left in solution.</p>

<p>In the subliming cell it melts at 134&deg;, but gives no crystalline sublimate. The
tube melting-point of the trihydrate is 170&deg;. The melted substance is at first colourless;
but on raising the temperature, the usual transitions of colour through different
shades of brown to black are observed. If melted, and kept a few degrees above its
melting-point, and then cooled slowly, the residue is straw-coloured, divided into
lobes, most of which contain feathery crystals.</p>

<p>At high temperatures narceine develops a herring-like odour; the residue becomes
darkish blue with iron chloride. Concentrated nitric acid dissolves it with a yellow
colour; on heating, red vapours are produced; the fluid contains crystals of oxalic
acid, and develops with potash a volatile base. Concentrated sulphuric acid colours
pure narceine brown; but if impure, a blood-red or blue colour may be produced.
It does not reduce iron salts.</p>

<p>Fr&ouml;hde&#8217;s reagent colours it first brown-green, then red, passing into blue. Narceine
forms precipitates with bichromate of potash, chloride of gold, bichloride of platinum,
and several other reagents. The one formed by the addition of potassio zinc iodide
is in hair-like crystals, which after twenty-four hours become blue.</p>

<p>Weak iodine solution colours narceine crystals a black-blue; they dissolve in water
at 100&deg; without colour, but on cooling again separate with a violet or blue colour.
If on a saturated solution of narceine a particle of iodine is strewn, fine needle-like
grey crystals form around the iodine. A drop of &#8220;Nessler&#8221; solution, added to solid
narceine, at once strikes a brown colour; on diluting the drop with a little water,
beautiful little bundles of crystals appear.&mdash;<i>Fl&uuml;ckiger.</i></p>

<p>The following group reagents precipitate narceine:&mdash;picric acid, tannin solution,
and potassium dichromate on long standing. The following give no precipitate:&mdash;mercuric
cyanide, mercuric potas. iodide, mercuric chloride, mercuric bromide, and
potas. ferrocyanide solutions.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_371" id="Sect_371"></a>&sect; 371. <b>Effects.</b>&mdash;The physiological action of narceine has been variously interpreted
by different observers. Claude Bernard<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> thought it the most somniferous of the
opium alkaloids. He said that &#8220;the narceinic sleep was characterised by a profound
calm and absence of the excitability of morphine, the animals narcotised by narceine
on awaking returning to their natural state without enfeeblement of the hind limbs
or other sequel&aelig;.&#8221; It has been amply confirmed that narceine possesses somniferous
properties, but certainly not to the extent that Bernard&#8217;s observations led physiologists
to expect. In large doses there is some irritation of the stomach and intestines,
and vomiting occurs, and even diarrh&#339;a; moderate doses induce constipation. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"><span class="fsize110">[314]</span></a></span>
maximum medicinal dose may be put at &middot;14 grm. (or 2&middot;26 grains), and a probably
dangerous dose would be three times that quantity.<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p>

<p><a name="Sect_372" id="Sect_372"></a>&sect; 372. <b>Papaverine</b> (<span class="chemform">C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>21</sub>NO<sub>4</sub></span>) crystallises from alcohol in white needles or scales.
It possesses scarcely any alkaline reaction, but its salts have an acid reaction; it has
but little effect on a ray of polarised light. It is almost insoluble in water; it is
easily soluble in acetone, amyl alcohol, alcohol, and chloroform. One part of the
alkaloid is dissolved in 36&middot;6 of benzene, and in 76 parts of amyl alcohol. Petroleum
ether dissolves it by the aid of heat, but the alkaloid separates in crystals on cooling.
Chloroform extracts it from either acid or alkaline solutions. Papaverine gives no
crystalline sublimate. The melting-point of pure samples in a tube is 147&deg;, with
scarcely any colour; it solidifies again to crystals on cooling; in the subliming cell
it melts at 130&deg;, and decomposes about 149&deg;; the vapours are alkaline; the residue
is amorphous, light brown, and is not characteristic. Concentrated sulphuric acid
colours it a deep violet-blue, and dissolves it to a violet, slowly fading. This solution,
by permanganate of potash, is first green and then grey. Fr&ouml;hde&#8217;s reagent
gives a beautiful violet colour, which becomes blue, and vanishes after twenty-four
hours. Diluted solutions of salts of papaverine are not precipitated by phosphomolybdic
acid. It is precipitated by ammonia, by the caustic and carbonated
alkalies, by potassic-cadmic iodide, iodine in hydriodic acid, and by alkaloidal
reagents generally&mdash;save by the important exception mentioned above. A solution
in amyl alcohol is also precipitated by bromine; the precipitate is crystalline. An
alcoholic solution of platinic chloride also separates papaverine platin chloride in
crystals. An alcoholic solution of iodine, added to an alcoholic solution of papaverine,
separates in a little time crystals of the composition <span class="chemform">C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>21</sub>NO<sub>4</sub>I<sub>3</sub></span>. From the
mother-liquor, by concentration, can be obtained needles of another iodine combination,
<span class="chemform">C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>21</sub>NO<sub>4</sub>I<sub>5</sub></span>; the latter heated above 100&deg; parts with free iodine. These
compounds with iodine are decomposed by ammonia and potash, papaverine separating.
The decomposition may be watched under the microscope. Nitric acid precipitates
from a solution of the sulphate a white nitrate soluble in excess; the precipitate does
not appear at once, but forms in the course of an hour; it is at first amorphous, but
subsequently crystalline; this, with its physical properties, is a great assistance to
identification.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_373" id="Sect_373"></a>&sect; 373. <b>Effects.</b>&mdash;Claude Bernard ranked papaverine with the convulsants; probably
the papaverine he had was impure. In any case, subsequent observations have shown
that it is to be classed rather with the hypnotic principles of opium. Leidesdorf<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>
administered it to the insane, and noted slowness of the pulse, muscular weakness,
and drowsiness to follow. The doses were given subcutaneously (&middot;42 grm. of the
hydrochloride). Baxt,<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> experimenting with the frog, found that a milligramme
caused deep sleep and slowing of the heart&#8217;s action. This action on the heart is
witnessed also on the recently-removed frog&#8217;s heart. Guinea-pigs, and other small
animals poisoned by strychnine or thebaine, and then given papaverine, did not
seem to be so soon affected with tetanus as when no such remedy was administered.
The fatal dose of papaverine for a man is unknown. I should conjecture that the
least quantity that would cause dangerous symptoms would be 1 grm. (15&middot;4 grains).</p>

ammonia, and solutions of the alkalies. It requires 10 parts of cold alcohol for
solution, and dissolves readily in hot. Ether, hot or cold, is also a good solvent.
100 parts of benzene are required for 5&middot;27 parts of thebaine, and 100 of amyl alcohol
for 1&middot;67 parts. Chloroform dissolves thebaine with difficulty out of both acid and
alkaline solutions; petroleum ether extracts it from neither. Thebaine melts in a
tube at 193&deg;, sublimes at 135&deg;. The sublimate is in minute crystals, similar to
theine; at higher temperatures (160&deg; to 200&deg;) needles, cubes, and prisms are obtained.
The residue is fawn coloured. Fr&ouml;hde&#8217;s reagent (as well as concentrated sulphuric
acid) dissolves it, with the production of a blood-red colour, passing gradually into
yellow. The precipitate with picric acid is yellow and amorphous; with tannic
acid yellow; with gold chloride, red-yellow; and with platinic chloride, citron-yellow,

<p><a name="Sect_375" id="Sect_375"></a>&sect; 375. <b>Effects.</b>&mdash;There is no disagreement of opinion as to the action of thebaine.
By the united testimony of all who have experimented with it, the alkaloid belongs
to those poisons which produce tetanus, and the symptoms can scarcely be differentiated
from strychnia. In Baxt&#8217;s experiments on frogs he showed that there was
some considerable difference in details in the general course of the symptoms, according
to the dose of the poison. A small dose (such, for example, as &middot;75 mgrm.)
injected into a frog subcutaneously produces immediate excitement, the animal
jumping about, and this stage lasting for about a minute; it then becomes quieter,
and has from three to six minutes&#8217; sleep; in a little time this comatose state is
followed by reflex tetanic spasms and then spontaneous tetanic spasms. With three
times the dose, the tetanic convulsions commence early, and death takes place in
from two to six hours. Baxt<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> found 6 to 7 mgrms. kill rabbits with tetanic convulsions
in from fifteen to twenty-five minutes. Crum Brown and Fraser also found
that 12 mgrms. injected into rabbits were fatal; it may then be presumed that the
lethal dose for a rabbit is about 5 mgrms. per kilo. A frog&#8217;s heart under the action of
thebaine, and removed from the body, beats quicker and ceases earlier than one in
distilled water. Thebaine has been administered to the insane subcutaneously in
doses of from 12 to 40 mgrms., when a rise of temperature and an increase in the
respiratory movements and in the circulation were noticed.<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a></p>

only contained in very minute traces in opium&mdash;something like &middot;003 per cent. It is
a crystalline substance, the crystals being colourless, six-sided prisms, without odour,
but with a bitter taste, causing an after-sensation like peppermint. The crystals
melt at 217&deg;, and congeal in a crystalline form again at 171&deg;; at high temperatures
they are decomposed with evolution of ammoniacal vapour. Cryptopine is insoluble,
or almost so, in ether, water, and oil of turpentine; it is soluble in acetone, benzene,
and chloroform; the latter is the best solvent, or hot alcohol; it is insoluble in
aqueous ammonia and in solutions of the caustic alkaloids. Cryptopine is strongly
basic, neutralising fully mineral acids. Concentrated sulphuric acid colours cryptopine
pure blue, the tint gradually fading from absorption of water from the atmosphere.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"><span class="fsize110">[316]</span></a></span>

colour in this way 10,000 parts of acid water blue or purple-red, 200,000 rose-red,
and 800,000 pale red. The reaction depends on a splitting up of the rh&#339;adine
into a colourless substance, <i>rh&#339;adin</i>, and a red colouring-matter. Rh&#339;adine is not
poisonous.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_378" id="Sect_378"></a>&sect; 378. <b>Pseudomorphine</b> (<span class="chemform">C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>19</sub>NO<sub>4</sub></span>).&mdash;Pseudomorphine was discovered by Pelletier
and Thiboumery in 1835. As precipitated by ammonia out of the hot solution,
pseudomorphine falls as a white crystalline precipitate; but if the solution is cold,
the precipitate is gelatinous. It possesses no taste, and has no action on vegetable
colours. On heating, it decomposes and then melts. It dissolves easily in caustic
alkalies and in milk of lime, but is insoluble in all the ordinary alcoholic and
ethereal solvents, as well as in diluted sulphuric acid. The most soluble salt is the
hydrochlorate (<span class="chemform">C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>19</sub>NO<sub>4</sub>HCl</span> + <span class="chemform">H<sub>2</sub>O</span>), and that requires 70 parts of water at 20&deg; for
solution. Various salts, such as the sulphate, oxalate, &amp;c., may be prepared from
the hydrochlorate by double decomposition. Concentrated sulphuric acid dissolves
pseudomorphine gradually, with the production of an olive-green colour.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_379" id="Sect_379"></a>&sect; 379. <b>Opianine</b> (<span class="chemform">C<sub>66</sub>H<sub>72</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>21</sub></span>).&mdash;Opianine crystallises in colourless, glittering
ortho-rhombic needles. Ammonia precipitates it from its solution in hydrochloric
acid as a fine white powder. It is without odour, and has a bitter taste. It is a strong
base, and is soluble in cold, but slightly soluble in boiling water. It is also but little
soluble in boiling alcohol.</p>

<p>An alcoholic solution of the alkaloid gives a voluminous precipitate with mercuric
chloride; after standing a little time, the precipitate becomes crystalline, the crystals
being in the shape of fine needles. They have the following composition&mdash;<span class="chemform">C<sub>66</sub>H<sub>72</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>21</sub></span>,
<span class="chemform">2HCl</span>, <span class="chemform">2HgCl</span>&mdash;and are with difficulty soluble in water or alcohol.</p>

<p>Opianine, administered to cats in doses of &middot;145 grm., produces complex symptoms&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>,
dilated pupils, foaming at the mouth, uncertain gait, paralysis of the hinder
extremities, and stupor&mdash;but the alkaloid is rare, and few experiments have been
made with it.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_380" id="Sect_380"></a>&sect; 380. <b>Apomorphine</b> (<span class="chemform">C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>19</sub>NO<sub>3</sub></span>).&mdash;Apomorphine is a derivative of morphine,
and is readily prepared by saponifying morphine by heating it with dilute hydrochloric
acid in sealed tubes. The result is apomorphine hydrochloride, the morphine
losing one molecule of water, according to the equation <span class="chemform">C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>19</sub>NO<sub>3</sub></span> = <span class="chemform">C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>17</sub>NO<sub>2</sub></span> + <span class="chemform">H<sub>2</sub>O</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"><span class="fsize110">[317]</span></a></span></p>

<p>To extract apomorphine, the bases are precipitated by sodic bicarbonate, and the
precipitate extracted by ether or chloroform, either of which solvents leaves morphine
undissolved. The apomorphine is again converted into hydrochloride, and once
more precipitated by sodic bicarbonate, and is lastly obtained as a snow-white substance,
rapidly becoming green on exposure to the air. The mass dissolves with a
beautiful green colour in water, and also in alcohol, whilst it colours ether purple-red,
and chloroform violet.</p>

<p>A test for apomorphine is the following:&mdash;The chloride is dissolved in a little
acetic acid and shaken with a crystal of potassic iodate (<span class="chemform">KIO<sub>3</sub></span>); this immediately
turns red from liberated iodine on shaking it up with a little chloroform; on standing,
the chloroform sinks to the bottom, and is coloured by the alkaloid a beautiful
blue colour; on now carefully pouring a little <span class="chemform">CS<sub>2</sub></span> on the surface of the liquid at the
point of junction it is coloured amethyst owing to dissolved iodine, and apocodeine
gives a similar reaction.</p>

<p>Apomorphine is the purest and most active emetic known: whether injected
beneath the skin or taken by the mouth, the effect is the same&mdash;there is considerable
depression, faintness, and then vomiting. The dose for an adult is about 6 mgrms.

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>The most generally accepted view at the present time is that the
physiological action of meconic acid is similar to that of lactic acid&mdash;viz.,
large doses cause some depression and feeble narcosis.</p>

<p>In a special research amongst organic fluids for meconic acid, the substances
are extracted by alcohol <i>feebly</i> acidulated with nitric acid; on
filtration the alcohol, after the addition of a little water, is distilled off,
and to the remaining fluid a solution of acetate of lead is added, and the
whole filtered. The filtrate will contain any alkaloids, whilst meconic
acid, if present, is bound up with the lead on the filter. The meconate
of lead may be either washed or digested in strong acetic acid to purify
it, suspended in water, and freed from lead by <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>; the filtrate from
the lead sulphide may be tested by ferric chloride, or preferably, at once
evaporated to dryness, and weighed. After this operation it is identified.
If the quantity is so small that it cannot be conveniently weighed, it may
be estimated colorimetrically, by having a standard solution of meconic
acid, containing 1 mgrm. in every c.c. A few drops of neutral ferric
chloride are added in a Nessler cylinder to the liquid under examination;
and the tint thus obtained is imitated in the usual way, in another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
cylinder, by means of ferric chloride, the standard solution, and water.
It is also obvious that the weight of the meconic acid may be increased
by converting it into the barium salt&mdash;100 parts of anhydrous baric
meconate, (<span class="chemform">Ba<sub>2</sub>C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub></span>), being equivalent to 42&middot;3 of meconic acid

<h5>1. NUX VOMICA GROUP&mdash;STRYCHNINE&mdash;BRUCINE&mdash;IGASURINE.</h5>

<p><a name="Sect_385" id="Sect_385"></a>&sect; 385. Nux vomica is found in commerce both in the entire state
and as a powder. It is the seed of the <i>Strychnos nux vomica</i>, or
Koochla tree. The seed is about the size of a shilling, round, flattened,
concavo-convex, of a yellowish-grey or light-brown colour, covered with
a velvety down of fine, radiating, silky hairs, which are coloured by a
solution of iodine beautiful gold-yellow; the texture is tough, leathery,
and not easily pulverised; the taste is intensely bitter. The powder is
not unlike that of liquorice, and, if met with in the pure state, gives a
dark orange-red colour with nitric acid, which is destroyed by chloride
of tin; the aqueous infusion gives a precipitate with tincture of galls, is
reddened by nitric acid, and gives an olive-green tint with persulphate of
iron. The best method, however, of recognising quickly and with certainty
that the substance under examination is nux vomica powder, is to
extract strychnine from it by the following simple process:&mdash;The powder
is completely exhausted by boiling alcohol (90 per cent.), the alcoholic
extract evaporated to dryness, and then treated with water; the aqueous
solution is passed through a wet filter, and concentrated by evaporation to
a small bulk. To this liquid a drop or so of a concentrated solution of
picric acid is added, and the yellow precipitate of picrates thus obtained
is separated, treated with nitric acid, the picric acid removed by ether, and
the pure alkaloid precipitated by soda, and shaken out by chloroform.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_386" id="Sect_386"></a>&sect; 386. <b>Chemical Composition.</b>&mdash;Nux vomica contains at least four
distinct principles:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<ul class="nostyle">
<li>(1.) Strychnine.</li>
<li>(2.) Brucine.</li>
<li>(3.) Igasurine.</li>
<li>(4.) Strychnic or igasuric acid.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="Sect_387" id="Sect_387"></a>&sect; 387. <b>Strychnine</b> (<span class="chemform">C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>22</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub></span>) is contained in the bean of S.
<i>ignatius</i>, in the bark (<i>false angustura bark</i>) and seeds of the <i>Strychnos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
nux vomica</i>, in the <i>Strychnos colubrina</i>, L., in the <i>Strychnos tieut&eacute;</i>,
Lesch, and probably in various other plants of the same genus.</p>

<p>Commercial strychnine is met with either in colourless crystals or as a
white powder, the most usual form being that of the alkaloid itself;
but the nitrate, sulphate, and acetate are also sold to a small extent.</p>

<p>The <i>microscopical appearance</i> of strychnine, as thrown down by the
solution of vapour of ammonia, may be referred to three leading forms&mdash;the
long rectangular prism, the short hexagonal prism, or the regular
octahedron. If obtained from the slow evaporation of an alcoholic
solution, it is usually in the form of four-sided pyramids or long
prisms; but if obtained by speedy evaporation or rapid cooling, it
appears as a white granular powder. If obtained from a benzene
solution, the deposit is usually crystalline, but without a constant form,
though at times the crystals are extremely distinct, the short six-sided
prism prevailing; but triangular plates, dodecahedral, rhomboidal, and
pentagonal, may also be met with. An ethereal solution on evaporation
assumes dendritic forms, but may contain octahedra and four-sided
prisms. A chloroform solution deposits rosettes, veined leaves, stellate
dotted needles, circles with broken radii, and branched and reticulated
forms of great delicacy and beauty.&mdash;<i>Guy.</i></p>

<p>Strychnine is very insoluble in water, although readily dissolved by
acidulated water. According to Wormley&#8217;s repeated experiments, one
part of strychnine dissolves in 8333 parts of cold water; and, according
to Pelletier and Cahours, it dissolves in 6667 parts of cold, and 2500
parts of boiling water. It may be convenient, then, to remember that
a gallon of cold water would hardly dissolve more than 10 grains (&middot;142
grm. per litre); the same amount, if boiling, about 30 grains (&middot;426 grm.
per litre) of strychnine. The solubility of one part of strychnine in
other menstrua is as follows:&mdash;Cold alcohol, 0&middot;833 specific gravity, 120,
boiling, 10 parts (<i>Wittstein</i>); cold alcohol, 0&middot;936 specific gravity, 240 parts
(<i>Merck</i>); cold alcohol, 0&middot;815 specific gravity, 107 parts (<i>Dragendorff</i>);
amyl alcohol, 181 parts; benzene, 164; chloroform, 6&middot;9 (<i>Schlimpert</i>),
5 (<i>Pettenkofer</i>); ether, 1250 parts; carbon disulphide, 485 parts;
glycerin, 300 parts. Creosote and essential and fixed oils also dissolve
strychnine.</p>

<p>Of all the above solvents, it is evident that chloroform is the best for
purposes of separation, and next to chloroform, benzene.</p>

<p>If a speck of strychnine be placed in the subliming cell, it will be found
to sublime usually in a crystalline form at 169&deg;. A common form at this
temperature, according to the writer&#8217;s own observations, is minute needles,
disposed in lines; but, as Dr. Guy has remarked, the sublimate may consist
of drops, of waving patterns, and various other forms; and, further,
while the sublimates of morphia are made up of curved lines, those of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
strychnine consist of lines either straight or slightly curved, with parallel
feathery lines at right angles. On continuing the heat, strychnine melts
at about 221&deg;, and the lower disc, if removed and examined, is found to
have a resinous residue; but it still continues to yield sublimates until
reduced to a spot of carbon. The melting-point taken in a tube is
268&deg;.</p>

<p>Strychnine is so powerfully bitter, that one part dissolved in 70,000 of
water is distinctly perceptible; it is a strong base, with a marked alkaline
reaction, neutralising the strongest acids fully, and precipitating many
metallic oxides from their combinations, often with the formation of
double salts. Most of the salts of strychnine are crystalline, and all extremely
bitter. Strychnine, in the presence of oxygen, combines with
<span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span> to form a beautiful crystalline compound:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="chemreact">2C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>22</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>S + O<sub>3</sub> = 2C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>22</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>3H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

<p>On treatment with an acid this compound yields <span class="chemform">H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub></span>.&mdash;Schmidt, <i>Ber.
Deutsch. Chem. Ges.</i>, 8, 1267.</p>

<p>An alcoholic solution of strychnine turns the plane of polarisation to
the left, [&#945;]<i>r</i> = -132&middot;08&deg; to 136&middot;78&deg; (<i>Bouchardat</i>); but acid solutions
show a much smaller rotatory power.</p>

<p>The salts used in medicine are&mdash;the <i>sulphate</i>, officinal only in the
French pharmacop&#339;ia; the <i>nitrate</i>, officinal in the German, Austrian,
Swiss, Norse, and Dutch pharmacop&#339;ias; and the <i>acetate</i>, well known
in commerce, but not officinal.</p>

<p>The commercial <b>Sulphate</b> (<span class="chemform">C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>22</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub></span> + <span class="chemform">2H<sub>2</sub>O</span>) is an acid salt
crystallising in needles which lose water at 150&deg;, the neutral sulphate
(<span class="chemform">2C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>22</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub></span> + <span class="chemform">7H<sub>2</sub>O</span>) crystallises in four-sided, orthorhombic
prisms, and is soluble in about 50 parts of cold water.</p>

<p>The <b>Nitrate</b> (<span class="chemform">C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>22</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>,HNO<sub>3</sub></span>) crystallises on evaporation from a
warm solution of the alkaloid in dilute nitric acid, in silky needles,
mostly collected in groups. The solubility of this salt is considerable,
one part dissolving in 50 of cold, in 2 of boiling water; its solubility in
boiling and cold alcohol is almost the same, taking 60 of the former and
2 of the latter.</p>

<p>The <b>Acetate</b> crystallises in tufts of needles; as stated, it is not officinal
in any of the European pharmacop&#339;ias.</p>

strychnine are<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1.) <b>The Chromate of Strychnine</b> (<span class="chemform">C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>22</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>CrHO<sub>2</sub></span>), formed by
adding a neutral solution of chromate of potash to a solution of a
strychnine salt, crystallises out of hot water in beautiful, very insoluble,
orange-yellow needles, mixed with plates of various size and thickness.
The salt is of great practical use to the analyst; for by its aid strychnine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
may be separated from a variety of substances, and in part from brucine&mdash;the
colour tests being either applied direct to the strychnine chromate,
or the chromate decomposed by ammonia, and the strychnine recovered
from the alkaline liquid by chloroform.</p>

<p>(2.) <b>Sulphocyanide of Strychnine</b> (<span class="chemform">C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>22</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>CNHS</span>) is a thick,
white precipitate, produced by the addition of a solution of potassic
sulphocyanide to that of a strychnine salt; on warming it dissolves, but
on cooling reappears in the form of long silky needles.</p>

<p>(3.) <b>Double Salts.</b>&mdash;The platinum compound obtained by adding a
solution of platinic chloride to one of strychnine chloride has the composition
<span class="chemform">C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>22</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>HClPtCl<sub>2</sub></span>, and crystallises out of weak boiling alcohol
(in which it is somewhat soluble) in gold-like scales. The similar palladium
compound (<span class="chemform">C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>22</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>HCl,PdCl</span>) is in dark brown needles,
and the gold compound (<span class="chemform">C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>22</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>HClAuCl<sub>3</sub></span>) in orange-coloured
needles.</p>

<p>(4.) <b>Strychnine Trichloride.</b>&mdash;The action of chlorine on strychnine&mdash;by
which chlorine is substituted for a portion of the hydrogen&mdash;has been
proposed as a test. The alkaloid is dissolved in very dilute <span class="chemform">HCl</span>, so as
to be only just acid; on now passing through chlorine gas, a white
insoluble precipitate is formed, which may be recrystallised from ether;
it has probably the composition <span class="chemform">C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>19</sub>Cl<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub></span>, and is extremely insoluble
in water.</p>

<p>(5.) <b>The Iodide of Strychnine</b> (<span class="chemform">C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>22</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>HI<sub>3</sub></span>) is obtained by the
action of iodine solution on strychnine sulphate; on solution of the precipitate
in alcohol, and evaporation, it forms violet-coloured crystals, very
similar to those of potassic permanganate.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_388" id="Sect_388"></a>&sect; 388. <b>Pharmaceutical and other Preparations of Nux Vomica and
Strychnine, with Suggestions for their Valuation.</b></p>

<p><b>An aqueous extract of nux vomica</b>, officinal in the German pharmacop&#339;ia,
appears to contain principally brucine, with a small percentage
of strychnine; the proportion of brucine to strychnine being about four-fifths
to one-fifth. Blossfield found in a sample 4&middot;3 per cent. of total
alkaloid, and two samples examined by Grundmann consisted (No. 1) of
strychnine, 0&middot;6 per cent.; brucine, 2&middot;58 per cent.&mdash;total, 3&middot;18 per cent.;
(No. 2) strychnine, 0&middot;68 per cent.; brucine, 2&middot;62 per cent.&mdash;total, 3&middot;3
per cent. A sample examined by Dragendorff yielded&mdash;strychnine, 0&middot;8
per cent.; brucine, 3&middot;2 per cent.&mdash;total, 4 per cent. The maximum
medicinal dose is put at &middot;6 grm. (9<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>14</sub> grains).</p>

<p><b>The spirituous extract of nux vomica</b>, officinal in the British and all
the Continental pharmacop&#339;ias, differs from the aqueous in containing a
much larger proportion of alkaloids, viz., about 15 per cent., and about
half the total quantity being strychnine. The medicinal dose is 21&middot;6-64&middot;8
mgrms. (<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>3</sub> grain to a grain).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>There is also an <b>extract of St. Ignatius bean</b> which is used in the
United States; nearly the whole of its alkaloid may be referred to
strychnine.</p>

<p><b>The tincture of nux vomica</b>, made according to the British Pharmacop&#339;ia,
contains in 1 fl. oz. 1 grain of alkaloids, or 0&middot;21 part by weight
in 100 by volume, but the strength of commercial samples often varies.
Lieth found in one sample 0&middot;122 per cent. of strychnine and 0&middot;09 per
cent. brucine; and two samples examined by Wissel consisted respectively
of 0&middot;353 per cent. and 0&middot;346 per cent. of total alkaloids. Dragendorff
found in two samples &middot;2624 per cent. and &middot;244 per cent. of total
alkaloids, about half of which was strychnine.</p>

<p><b>Analysis.</b>&mdash;Either of the extracts may be treated for a few hours on
the water-bath, with water acidulated by sulphuric acid, filtered, the
residue well washed, the acid liquid shaken up with benzene to separate
impurities, and, on removal of the benzene, alkalised with ammonia, and
shaken up two or three times with chloroform; the chloroform is then
evaporated in a tared vessel, and the total alkaloids weighed. The
alkaloids can then be either (<i>a</i>) treated with 11 per cent. of nitric
acid on the water-bath until all the brucine is destroyed, and then
(the liquid being neutralised) precipitated by potassic chromate; or (<i>b</i>)
the alkaloids may be converted into picrates. Picrate of strychnine is
very insoluble in water, 1 part requiring no less than 10,000 of water.<a name="FNanchor_423" id="FNanchor_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a>
The tincture is analysed on precisely similar principles, the spirit
being got rid of by distillation, and the residue treated by acidified
water, &amp;c.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>The nux vomica powder itself may be valued as follows:&mdash;15 to 20
grms., pulverised as finely as possible, are treated three times with 150
to 300 c.c. of water, acidified with sulphuric acid, well boiled, and, after
each boiling, filtered and thoroughly pressed. The last exhaustion must
be destitute of all bitter taste. The united filtrates are then evaporated
to the consistence of a thick syrup, which is treated with sufficient burnt
magnesia to neutralise the acid. The extract is now thoroughly exhausted
with boiling alcohol of 90 per cent.; the alcoholic extract, in its turn, is
evaporated nearly to dryness, and treated with acidulated water; this
acid solution is freed from impurities by shaking up with benzene, and
lastly alkalised with ammonia, and the alkaloids extracted by shaking
up with successive portions of chloroform. The chloroformic extract
equals the total alkaloids, which may be separated in the usual way.</p>

<p>In four samples of nux vomica examined by Dragendorff, the total
alkaloids ranged from 2&middot;33 to 2&middot;42 per cent. Grate found in two
samples 2&middot;88 per cent. and 2&middot;86 per cent. respectively; while Karing
from one sample separated only 1&middot;65 per cent. The strychnine and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
brucine are in about equal proportions, Dragendorff<a name="FNanchor_424" id="FNanchor_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> finding 1&middot;187 per
cent. strychnine and 1&middot;145 per cent. brucine.<a name="FNanchor_425" id="FNanchor_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a></p>

were attempted to be given in milk. The fatal dose of nux vomica must be
ruled by its alkaloidal content, which may be so low as 1 per cent., and
as high as nearly 3 per cent. 30 grains have proved fatal (<i>Taylor</i>); if
the powder in this instance was of the ordinary strength, the person
died from less than a grain (&middot;0648 grm.) of the united alkaloids.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_389" id="Sect_389"></a>&sect; 389. <b>Statistics.</b>&mdash;In England, during the ten years 1883-92, out of
6666 total deaths from poison, strychnine, nux vomica, and vermin-killer
account for 325. Out of these deaths, 118 were ascribed to &#8220;vermin-killer.&#8221;
&#8220;Vermin-killer&#8221; may be presumed to include not only strychnine
mixtures, but also phosphorus and arsenic pastes and powders, so
that there are no means of ascertaining the number of strychnine cases
comprised under this heading. Taking the deaths actually registered as
due to strychnine or nux vomica, they are about 4&middot;7 per cent. of the
deaths from all sorts of poison. Of these deaths, 268, or 82&middot;4 per cent.,
were suicidal, 8 were homicidal, and 49 only were accidental.</p>

<p>Schauenstein has collected from literature 130 cases of poisoning by
strychnine, but most of these occurred during the last twenty-five years;
62 of the 130, or about one-half, were fatal, and 15 were homicidal. It has
been stated that strychnine is so very unsuitable for the purpose of
criminal poisoning as to render it unlikely to be often used. Facts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
however, do not bear out this view; for, allowing its intensely bitter
taste, yet it must be remembered that bitter liquids, such as bitter ale, are
in daily use, and a person accustomed to drink any liquid rapidly might
readily imbibe sufficient of a toxic liquid to produce death before he was
warned by its bitterness. It is, indeed, capable of demonstration, that
taste is more vivid <i>after</i> a substance has been taken than just in the act
of swallowing, for the function of taste is not a rapid process, and requires
a very appreciable interval of time.</p>

<p>The series of murders by Thomas Neill, or, more correctly, Thomas
Neill Cream, is an example of the use of strychnine for the purposes of
murder. Thomas Neill Cream was convicted, October 21, 1892, for the
murder of Matilda Clover on October 20, 1891; there was also good
evidence that the same criminal had murdered Ellen Dunworth, October
13, 1891; Alice Marsh, April 12, 1892; Emma Shrivell, April 12, 1892,
and had attempted the life of Louie Harvey. The agent in all these
cases was strychnine. There was no evidence as to what form of the
poison was administered in the case of Clover, but Ellen Dunworth,
who was found dying in the streets at 7.45 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span>, and died less than
two hours afterwards, stated that a gentleman gave her &#8220;two drops&#8221; of
white stuff to drink.</p>

<p>In the cases of Marsh and Shrivell, Neill Cream had tea with them
on the night of April 11, and gave them both &#8220;three long pills;&#8221; half an
hour after Neill Cream left them they were found to be dying, and
died within six hours. From Marsh 7 grains, from Shrivell nearly 2
grains of strychnine were separated; the probability is that each pill
contained at least 3 grains of strychnine. The criminal met Louie
Harvey on the Embankment, and gave her &#8220;some pills&#8221; to take; she
pretended to do so, but threw them away. Hence it seems probable that
Neill Cream took advantage of the weakness that a large number of the
population have for taking pills, and mostly poisoned his victims in this
manner. Clover&#8217;s case was not diagnosed during life, but strychnine was
found six or seven months after burial in the body. It may be mentioned
incidentally that the accused himself furnished the clue which
led to his arrest, by writing letters charging certain members of the
medical profession with poisoning these poor young prostitutes with
strychnine.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_390" id="Sect_390"></a>&sect; 390. <b>Fatal Dose.</b>&mdash;In a research, which may, from its painstaking
accuracy, be called classical, F. A. Falck has thrown much light upon
the minimum lethal dose of strychnine for various animals. It would
seem that, in relation to its size, the frog is by no means so sensible to
strychnine as was believed, and that animals such as cats and rabbits
take a smaller dose in proportion to their body-weight. The method used
by Falck was to inject subcutaneously a solution of known strength of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
strychnine nitrate, and, beginning at first with a known lethal dose, a
second experiment was then made with a smaller dose, and if that proved
fatal, with a still smaller, and so on, until such a quantity was arrived at,
that the chances as determined by direct observation were as great of
recovery as of death. Operating in this way, and making no less than
20 experiments on the rabbit, he found that the least fatal dose for that
animal was &middot;6 mgrm. of strychnine nitrate per kilogramme. Cats were
a little less susceptible, taking &middot;75 mgrm. Operating on fowls, he found
that strychnine taken into the crop in the usual way was very uncertain;
50 mgrms. per kilo, taken with the food had no effect, but results always
followed if the poison was introduced into the circulation by the subcutaneous
needle&mdash;the lethal dose for fowls being, under those circumstances,
1 to 2 mgrms. per kilo. He made 35 experiments on frogs, and
found that to kill a frog by strychnine nitrate, at least 2 mgrms. per kilo,
must be injected. Mice take a little more, from 2&middot;3 to 2&middot;4 mgrms. per
kilo. In 2 experiments on the ring adder, in one 62&middot;5 mgrms. per kilo.
of strychnine nitrate, injected subcutaneously, caused death in seven
hours; in the second, 23&middot;1 mgrms. per kilo. caused death in five days;
hence the last quantity is probably about the least fatal dose for this
particular snake.</p>

<p>These observations may be conveniently thrown into the following
<a href="#Table_362">table</a> (see next page), placing the animals in order according to their
relative sensitiveness.<a name="FNanchor_426" id="FNanchor_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a></p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_426" id="Footnote_426"></a><a href="#FNanchor_426"><span class="label">[426]</span></a> According to Christison&#8217;s researches, 0&middot;2 grm. (about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>3</sub> grain)
is fatal to swine; &middot;03 grm. (<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> grain) to bears, if injected into the
pleura. 1 to 3 grains (&middot;0648 to &middot;1944 grm.) is given to horses in cases
of paralysis, although 3 grains cannot but be considered a dangerous
dose, unless smaller doses have been previously administered without
effect; 10 grains would probably kill a horse, and 15 grains (&middot;972 grm.)
have certainly done so.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>Now, the important question arises, as to the place in this series
occupied by man&mdash;a question difficult to solve, because so few cases are
recorded in which strychnine has been administered by subcutaneous
injection with fatal result. Eulenberg has observed poisonous symptoms,
but not death, produced by 6 mgrms. (<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>11</sub> grain) and by 10 mgrms.
(about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>6</sub> grain). Bois observed poisonous symptoms from the similar
subcutaneous administrations of 8 mgrms. to a child six years old, and
4 mgrms. to another child four years old&mdash;the latter dose, in a case
recorded by Christison, actually killing a child of three years of age. On
the other hand, the smallest lethal dose taken by an adult was swallowed
in solution. Dr. Warner took 32 mgrms. (<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> grain) of strychnine sulphate,
mistaking it for morphine sulphate, and died in twenty minutes.
In other cases 48 mgrms. (<sup>7</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub> grain) have been fatal. It will be safe to
conclude that these doses by the stomach would have acted still more
surely and energetically if injected subcutaneously. The case of Warner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
is exceptional, for he was in weak health; and, if calculated out according
to body-weight, presuming that Dr. Warner weighed 68 kilos., the
relative dose as strychnine nitrate would be &middot;24 per kilo.&mdash;a smaller dose
than for any animal hitherto experimented upon. There is, however, far
more reason for believing that the degree of sensitiveness in man is about
the same as that of cats or dogs, and that the least fatal dose for man is
&middot;70 per kilo., the facts on record fairly bearing out this view. It is,
therefore, probable that death would follow if 38 mgrms. (<sup>7</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub> grain) were
injected subcutaneously into a man of the average weight of 68 kilos.
(150 lbs.). Taylor estimates the fatal dose of strychnine for adults as
from 32&middot;4 to 129&middot;6 mgrms. (&middot;5 to 2 grains); Guy puts the minimum at
16&middot;2 mgrms. (&middot;25 grain).</p>

<p>Large doses of strychnine may be recovered from if correct medical
treatment is sufficiently prompt. Witness the remarkable instances on
record of duplex poisonings, in which the would-be-suicide has unwittingly
defeated his object by taking strychnine simultaneously with some
narcotic, such as opium or chloral. In a case related by Schauenstein,<a name="FNanchor_427" id="FNanchor_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a>
a suicidal pharmacist took &middot;48 grm. or &middot;6 grm. (7&middot;4 to 9&middot;25 grains) of
strychnine nitrate dissolved in about 30 c.c. of bitter-almond water, and
then, after half an hour, since no symptoms were experienced, &middot;6 grm.
(9&middot;25 grains) of morphine acetate, which he likewise dissolved in bitter-almond
water and swallowed. After about ten minutes, he still could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
walk with uncertain steps, and poured some chloroform on the pillow-case
of his bed, and lay on his face in order to breathe it. In a short
time he lost consciousness, but again awoke, and lay in a half-dreamy
state, incapable of motion, until some one entered the room, and hearing
him murmur, came to his bedside. At that moment&mdash;two and a quarter
hours after first taking the strychnine&mdash;the pharmacist had a fearful
convulsion, the breathing was suspended, and he lost consciousness.
Again coming to himself, he had several convulsions, and a physician
who was summoned found him in general tetanus. There were first
clonic, then tonic convulsions, and finally opisthotonus was fully
developed. The treatment consisted of emetics, and afterwards tannin
and codeine were given separately. The patient slept at short intervals;
in ten hours after the taking of the poison the seizures were fewer in
number and weaker in character, and by the third day recovery was
complete. Dr. Macredy<a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> has also placed on record an interesting case,
in which the symptoms, from a not very large dose of strychnine, were
delayed by laudanum for eight hours. A young woman, twenty-three
years of age, pregnant, took at 10 <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span> a quantity of strychnine estimated
at 1&middot;5 grain, in the form of Battle&#8217;s vermin-killer, and immediately afterwards
2 ounces of laudanum. She was seen by Dr. Macredy in four
hours, and was then suffering from pronounced narcotic symptoms. A
sulphate of zinc emetic was administered. In eight hours after taking
the strychnine, there were first observed some clonic convulsive movements
of the hands, and, in a less degree, the legs. These convulsions
continued, at times severe, for several hours, and were treated with
chloral. Recovery was speedy and complete.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_391" id="Sect_391"></a>&sect; 391. <b>Action on Animals.</b>&mdash;The action of strychnine has been experimentally
studied on all classes of animals, from the infusoria upwards.
The effects produced on animal forms which possess a nervous system
are strikingly alike, and even in the cephalopoda, tetanic muscular spasm
may be readily observed. Of all animals the frog shows the action of
strychnine in its purest form, especially if a dose be given of just sufficient
magnitude to produce toxic effects. The frog sits perfectly still
and quiet, unless acted upon by some external stimuli, such as a breath
of air, a loud noise, or the shaking of the vessel which contains it, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
an immediate tetanic convulsion of all the muscles is witnessed, lasting
a few seconds only, when the animal again resumes its former posture.
This heightened state of reflex action has its analogue in hydrophobia as
well as in idiopathic tetanus. If the frog thus poisoned by a weak dose
is put under a glass shade, kept moist, and sheltered from sound, or from
other sources of irritation, no convulsions occur, and after some days it is
in its usual health. If, on the other hand, by frequent stimuli, convulsions
are excited, the animal dies. M. Richet<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> has contributed a valuable
memoir to the Academy of Sciences on the toxic action of strychnine.
He has confirmed the statement of previous observers that, with artificial
respiration, much larger doses of strychnine may be taken without fatal
result than under normal conditions, and has also recorded some peculiar
phenomena. Operating on dogs and rabbits, after first securing a canula
in the trachea, and then injecting beneath the skin or into the saphena
vein 10 mgrms. of strychnine hydrochlorate, the animal is immediately,
or within a few seconds, seized with tetanic convulsions, and this attack
would be mortal, were it not for artificial respiration. Directly this is
practised the attack ceases, and the heart, after a period of hurried and
spasmodic beats, takes again its regular rhythm. Stronger and stronger
doses may then be injected without causing death. As the dose is thus
augmented, the symptoms differ. M. Richet distinguishes the following
periods:&mdash;(1.) A period of tetanus. (2.) A period of convulsion, characterised
by spasmodic and incessant contraction of all the muscles. (3.)
A little later, when the quantity exceeds 10 mgrms. per kilo., a choreic
period, which is characterised by violent rhythmic shocks, very sudden
and short, repeated at intervals of about three to four seconds; during
these intervals there is almost complete relaxation. (4.) A period of
relaxation; this period is attained when the dose exceeds 40 mgrms. per
kilo. Reflex action is annihilated, the spontaneous respiratory movements
cease, the heart beats tumultuously and regularly in the severe
tetanic convulsions at first, and then contracts with frequency but with
regularity. The pupils, widely dilated at first, become much contracted.
The arterial pressure, enormously raised at the commencement, diminishes
gradually, in one case from 0&middot;34 mm. to 0&middot;05 mm. The temperature undergoes
analogous changes, and during the convulsions is extraordinarily
elevated; it may even attain 41&deg; or 42&deg;, to sink in the period of relaxation
to 36&deg;. Dogs and rabbits which have thus received enormous quantities
of strychnine (<i>e.g.</i>, 50 mgrms. per kilo.), may, in this way, live for
several hours, but the slightest interruption to the artificial respiration,
in the relaxed state, is followed by syncope and death.</p>

may be extremely rapid, the rapidity being mainly dependent on the form
of the poison and the manner of application. A soluble salt of strychnine
injected subcutaneously will act within a few seconds;<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> in a case of
amaurosis, related by Schuler,<a name="FNanchor_432" id="FNanchor_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> 5&middot;4 mgrms. of a soluble strychnine salt
were introduced into the punctum lachrymale;&mdash;in less than four
minutes there were violent tetanic convulsions. In a case related by
Barker, the symptoms commenced in three minutes from a dose of &middot;37
grm. (5&middot;71 grains).<a name="FNanchor_433" id="FNanchor_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> Here the poison was not administered subcutaneously.
Such short periods, to a witness whose mind was occupied
during the time, might seem immediate. On the other hand, when nux
vomica powder has been taken, and when strychnine has been given in
the form of pill, no such rapid course has been observed, or is likely to
occur, the usual course being for the symptoms to commence within half
an hour. It is, however, also possible for them to be delayed from one
to two hours, and under certain circumstances (as in the case related by
Macredy) for eight hours. In a few cases, there is first a feeling of
uneasiness and heightened sensibility to external stimuli, a strange
feeling in the muscles of the jaw, and a catching of the respiration; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
generally the onset of the symptoms is as sudden as epilepsy, and
previous to their appearance the person may be pursuing his ordinary
vocation, when, without preliminary warning, there is a shuddering of
the whole frame, and a convulsive seizure. The convulsions take the
form of violent general tetanus; the limbs are stretched out involuntarily,
the hands are clenched, the soles of the feet incurved, and, in the height
of the paroxysm, the back may be arched and rigid as a board, the
sufferer resting on head and heels, and the abdomen tense. In the
grasp of the thoracic muscles the walls of the chest are set immovable,
and from the impending suffocation the face becomes congested, the
eyes prominent and staring. The muscles of the lower jaw&mdash;in &#8220;disease
tetanus&#8221; the first to be affected&mdash;are in &#8220;strychnos tetanus,&#8221; as a rule,
the last; a distinction, if it were more constant, of great clinical value.
The convulsions and remissions recur until death or recovery, and, as a
rule, within two hours from the commencement of the symptoms the
case in some way or other terminates. The number of the tetanic
seizures noted has varied&mdash;in a few cases the third spasm has passed
into death, in others there have been a great number. The duration of
the spasm is also very different, and varies from thirty seconds to five or
even eight minutes, the interval between lasting from forty-five seconds<a name="FNanchor_434" id="FNanchor_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>

<p>Richardson&#8217;s liquor bismuth contains <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>20</sub> grain of strychnine in each
drachm. The mixture was alkaline; it contained 1&middot;7 grain of strychnine
and 38&middot;25 minims of chloroform.</p>

<p>The patient, a woman, 54 years of age, had taken the previous doses with
considerable relief; but ten minutes after the last dose, which she
described as far more bitter than those she had taken previously, she
was seized with the usual symptoms of strychnine poisoning, but
recovered after five hours.</p>

<p>The explanation is pretty obvious; the mixture was alkaline, so that the
strychnine was not in the form of a salt, but in the free state, and was
therefore dissolved by the chloroform; the amount of strychnine taken in
each dose wholly depended on whether or not the mixture was shaken
violently and poured out into the teaspoon immediately after shaking; if
allowed to repose the globules of chloroform saturated with strychnine
would settle at the bottom, and there form a stratum rich in strychnine;
so that the last dose would certainly contain an excess.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_393" id="Sect_393"></a>&sect; 393. <b>Diagnosis of Strychnine Poisoning.</b>&mdash;However striking and
well defined the picture of strychnine tetanus may be, mistakes in
diagnosis are rather frequent, especially when a medical man is hastily
summoned, has never seen a case of similar poisoning, and has no
suspicion of the possible nature of the seizure. If a young woman, for
instance, is the subject, he may put it down to hysteria, and certainly
hysteria not unfrequently affects somewhat similar convulsions. In a
painful case in which the author was engaged, a young woman either
took or was given (for the mystery was never cleared up fully) a fatal
dose of strychnine, and though the symptoms were well marked, the
medical attendant was so possessed with the view that the case was due
to hysteria, that, even after making the <i>post-mortem</i> examination, and
finding no adequate lesion, he theorised as to the possibility of some
fatal hysteric spasm of the glottis, while there was ample chemical
evidence of strychnine, and a weighable quantity of the alkaloid was
actually separated from the contents of the stomach. The medical
attendant of Matilda Clover, one of Neill&#8217;s victims, certified that the girl
died from <i>delirium tremens</i> and syncope, although the symptoms were
typically those produced by strychnine. Such cases are particularly
sad, for we now know that, with judicious treatment, a rather large dose
may be recovered from.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>If the case is a male, a confusion with epilepsy is possible, though
hardly to be explained or excused; while in both sexes idiopathic tetanus
is so extremely similar as to give rise to the idea that all cases of idiopathic
tetanus are produced by poison, perhaps secreted by the body
itself. As for the distinction between idiopathic and strychnic tetanus,
it is usually laid down (1) that the intervals in the former are characterised
by no relaxation of the muscles, but that they continue contracted
and hard; and (2) that there is a notable rise of temperature in disease
tetanus proper, and not in strychnine tetanus. Both statements are misleading,
and the latter is not true, for in strychnic poisoning the relaxation
is not constant, and very high temperatures in animals have been
observed.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_394" id="Sect_394"></a>&sect; 394. <b>Physiological Action.</b>&mdash;The tetanic convulsions are essentially
reflex, and to be ascribed to a central origin; the normal reflex sensibility
is exaggerated and unnaturally extended. If the ischiatic plexus supplying
the one leg of an animal is cut through, that leg takes no part in the
general convulsions, but if the artery of the leg alone is tied, then the
leg suffers from the muscular spasm, as well as the limbs in which the
circulation is unrestrained. In an experiment by Sir B. W. Richardson,
a healthy dog was killed, and, as soon as practicable, a solution of
strychnine was injected through the systemic vessels by the aorta&mdash;the
whole body became at once stiff and rigid as a board. These facts point
unmistakably to the spinal marrow as the seat of the toxic influence.
Strychnine is, <i>par excellence</i>, a spinal poison. On physiological grounds
the grey substance of the cord is considered to have an inhibitory action
upon reflex sensibility, and this inhibitory power is paralysed by strychnine.
The spinal cord, it would appear, has the power of collecting
strychnine from the circulation and storing it up in its structure.<a name="FNanchor_436" id="FNanchor_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></p>

<p>Much light has been thrown upon the cause of death by Richet&#8217;s
experiments.<a name="FNanchor_437" id="FNanchor_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> It would seem that, in some cases, death takes place by
a suffocation as complete as in drowning, the chest and diaphragm being
immovable, and the nervous respiratory centres exhausted. In such a
case, immediate death would be averted by a tracheal tube, by the aid of
which artificial respiration might be carried on; but there is another
asphyxia due to the enormous interstitial combustion carried on by
muscles violently tetanised. &#8220;If,&#8221; says Richet, &#8220;after having injected
into a dog a mortal dose of strychnine, and employed artificial respiration
according to the classic method twenty or thirty times a minute, the
animal dies (sometimes at the end of ten minutes, and in every case at
the end of an hour or two), and during life the arterial blood is examined,
it will be ascertained that it is black, absolutely like venous blood.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>This view is also supported by the considerable rise of temperature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
noticed: the blood is excessively poor in oxygen, and loaded with carbon
dioxide. That this state of the blood is produced by tetanus, is proved
by the fact that an animal poisoned by strychnine, and then injected subcutaneously
with curare in quantity just sufficient to paralyse the
muscular system, does not exhibit these phenomena. By the aid of
artificial respiration, together with the administration of curare, an
animal may live after a prodigious dose of strychnine.</p>

<p>Meyer<a name="FNanchor_438" id="FNanchor_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> has investigated carefully the action of strychnine on the
blood-pressure&mdash;through a strong excitement of the vaso-motor centre,
the arteries are narrowed in calibre, and the blood-pressure much increased;
the action of the heart in frogs is slowed, but in the warm-blooded
animals quickened.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_395" id="Sect_395"></a>&sect; 395. <b>Post-mortem Appearances.</b>&mdash;There is but little characteristic
in the <i>post-mortem</i> appearances from strychnine poisoning. The body
becomes very stiff a short time after death, and this rigidity remains
generally a long time. In the notorious Palmer case, the body was rigid
two months after death, but, on the other hand, the <i>rigor mortis</i> has
been known to disappear within twenty-four hours. If the convulsions
have been violent, there may be minute h&aelig;morrhages in the brain and
other parts. I have seen considerable h&aelig;morrhage in the trachea from
this cause. When death occurs from asphyxia, the ordinary signs of
asphyxia will be found in the lungs, &amp;c. The heart mostly has its
right side gorged with blood, but in a few cases it is empty and
contracted.</p>

<p>In a case which Schauenstein has recorded<a name="FNanchor_439" id="FNanchor_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> he found strychnine still
undissolved, coating the stomach as a white powder; but this is very
unusual, and I believe unique. The bladder often contains urine,
which, it need scarcely be said, should be preserved for chemical
investigation.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_396" id="Sect_396"></a>&sect; 396. <b>Treatment.</b>&mdash;From the cases detailed, and from the experiments
on animals, the direction which treatment should take is very
clear. As a matter of course, if there is the slightest probability of any
of the poison remaining in the stomach, it should be removed. It is
doubtful whether the stomach pump can be ever applied with benefit in
strychnine poisoning, the introduction of the tube is likely to aggravate
the tetanus, but apomorphine can be injected subcutaneously. Large and
frequent doses of chloral should be administered in order to lessen the
frequency of convulsions, or prevent their occurrence, and it may be
necessary in a few cases, where death threatens by suffocation, to perform
tracheotomy, and to use artificial respiration. Where chloral or
chloroform is not at hand, and in cases of emergency, where this may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
easily happen, the medical man must administer in full doses the nearest
narcotic at hand.<a name="FNanchor_440" id="FNanchor_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_440" id="Footnote_440"></a><a href="#FNanchor_440"><span class="label">[440]</span></a> It is certain that lutidine would be a valuable antidote for
strychnine. C. G. Williams found that lutidine injected into frogs
already under the influence of strychnine, arrested the convulsions, or
if given first, and then followed by a fatal dose of strychnine, it
prevented the appearance of the tetanus. (See <i>ante</i>, p. 276, <a href="#Footnote_359">footnote</a>.)</p>

<p><a name="Sect_397" id="Sect_397"></a>&sect; 397. <b>Separation of Strychnine from Organic Matters.</b>&mdash;The
separation of strychnine from organic matters, &amp;c., is undertaken strictly
on the general principles already detailed. It may happen, however,
that in cases of poisoning there is the strongest evidence from symptoms
in the person or animal that strychnine alone is to be sought for. In an
instance of the kind, if a complex organic liquid (such as the contents of
the stomach) is under examination, it is best to remove the solid substances
by filtration through glass, wool, or linen, and evaporate nearly to dryness
over the water-bath, acidifying with acetic acid, and then exhausting the
residue repeatedly with boiling alcohol of 80 per cent. The alcoholic
extract is in its turn evaporated to dryness, and taken up with water; the
aqueous solution is passed through a wet filter, and then shaken up with
the usual succession of fluids, viz., petroleum ether, benzene, chloroform,
and amyl alcohol, which will remove a great number of impurities, but
will not dissolve the strychnine from the acid solution. The amyl alcohol
may lastly be removed by petroleum ether; and on removal of the final
extractive (which should be done as thoroughly as possible) chloroform
is added, and the fluid is alkalised by ammonia, which precipitates the
alkaloid in the presence of the solvent. Should the reverse process be
employed&mdash;that is, ammonia added first, and then chloroform&mdash;the
strychnine is not so perfectly dissolved, since it has time to assume a
crystalline condition. On separation and evaporation of the chloroform,
the residue (if much discoloured, or evidently impure) may be dissolved
in alcohol or benzene, and recrystallised several times. Cushman has
published an improved method of separating strychnine, which, according
to test experiments, appears to give good results. He describes the method
as follows:<a name="FNanchor_441" id="FNanchor_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a><span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;The stomach contents or viscera properly comminuted are weighed, and an
aliquot part taken for analysis. The mass is digested in a beaker over night, at a
warm temperature, with water acidulated with acetic acid. The contents of the
beaker are filtered by pressing through muslin, and then passing through paper.
The clear filtrate is evaporated on the water-bath to soft dryness, an excess of
ordinary 80 per cent. alcohol added, and boiled ten minutes with stirring, and
allowed to stand one half hour at a warm temperature. This extraction is repeated,
the alcohol extracts united, filtered, evaporated to soft dryness, and the residue
taken up with a little water acidulated with acetic acid, and shaken out with pure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335"><span class="fsize110">[335]</span></a></span>
acetic ether in a separating funnel. Successive fresh portions of acetic ether are
used until the solvent shows by its colour, and by the evaporation of a few drops,
that it does not contain extractive matter. As many as twelve extractions are sometimes
necessary to accomplish this. Care should be taken in each case to allow time
for as complete separation as possible between the two layers. The purified acid
aqueous liquid, which need not exceed in bulk 50 c.c., is now returned to the
separator, an equal quantity of fresh acetic ether added, and enough sodic carbonate
in solution to render the mixture slightly alkaline, and the separator is then
thoroughly shaken for several minutes. All the alkaloid should now be in solution
in the acetic ether, but a second shaking of the alkaline liquid, with acetic ether, is
always made, the two extracts united, and evaporated in a glass dish over hot water
to dryness. It will now be found that the residue shows the alkaloid fairly pure,
but not pure enough for quantitative results. The residue is dissolved in a few drops
of dilute acetic acid, warmed to complete solution, filtered if necessary, diluted to
about 30 c.c., and the solution transferred to a small separating funnel; 30 c.c. of
ether-chloroform (1-1) are now added, and the separator shaken. After separation
the heavier ether-chloroform is allowed to run off, another lot of 30 c.c. of ether-chloroform
is added, the separator shaken, and immediately enough ammonia-water
added to render the mixture alkaline, and the whole vigorously agitated for several
minutes. After separation is complete, the ether-chloroform layer is run out into a
clean 50 c.c. glass-stoppered burette. The alkaline water solution is agitated with
20 c.c. more of the ether-chloroform, separated, and this extract added to that in
the burette. The burette is now supported over a small weighed glass dish, which
is kept warm on a water-bath, and the liquid allowed to evaporate gently, drop by
drop, until a sufficient quantity of the pure alkaloid has collected in the centre of
the dish to render an accurate weighing possible, or else all of the alkaloid may be
collected and weighed at once. After all possible tests have been made upon the
weighed alkaloid, the remainder is re-dissolved in a drop or two of acetic acid, a little
water added, and the dish exposed under a bell-glass to the fumes of ammonia. After
standing some time all the strychnine is found crystallised out in the beautiful characteristic
needle-formed crystals. The mother-liquor is drawn off with a small fine-pointed
tube and rubber bulb, the crystals carefully washed with a little water and
dried over sulphuric acid. The glass dish containing these crystals is kept as the
final exhibit, and is shown in evidence. Another convenient exhibit may be prepared
by moistening a small filter-paper with a solution of the alkaloid in dilute
acetic acid, then moistening with a solution of potassium dichromate: this paper,
on being dried, may be kept indefinitely. On moistening it, and touching it at any
time with a drop of strong sulphuric acid, a violet film, changing to cherry-red, is
formed at the place of contact.&#8221;</p>

<p>Should search be made for minute portions of strychnine in the tissues,
considering the small amount of the poison which may produce death, it
is absolutely necessary to operate on a very large quantity of material.
It would be advisable to take the whole of the liver, the brain, spinal
cord, spleen, stomach, duodenum, kidneys, all the blood that can be
obtained, and a considerable quantity of muscular tissue, so as to make
in all about one-eighth to one-tenth of the whole body; this may be cut
up into small pieces, and boiled in capacious flasks with alcohol, acidified
with acetic acid. Evaporation must be controlled by adapting to the
cork an upright condenser.</p>

<p>Should the analyst not have apparatus of a size to undertake this at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
one operation, it may be done in separate portions&mdash;the filtrate from any
single operation being collected in a flask, and the spirit distilled off in
order to be used for the next. In this way, a large quantity of the
organs and tissues can be exhausted by half a gallon of alcohol. Finally,
most of the alcohol is distilled off, and the remainder evaporated at a
gentle heat in a capacious dish, the final extract being treated, evaporating
to a syrup, and using Cushman&#8217;s process (<i>ante</i>, <a href="#Page_334">p. 334</a>) as just
described. It is only by working on this large scale that there is any
probability of detecting absorbed strychnine in those cases where only
one or two grains have destroyed life, and even then it is possible
to miss the poison.</p>

<p>Strychnine is separated by the kidneys rapidly. In a suicidal case
recorded by Schauenstein,<a name="FNanchor_442" id="FNanchor_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> death took place in an hour and a half after
taking strychnine, yet from 200 c.c. of the urine, Schauenstein was able
to separate nitrate of strychnine in well-formed crystals. Dr. Kratter<a name="FNanchor_443" id="FNanchor_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a>
has made some special researches on the times within which strychnine
is excreted by the kidneys. In two patients, who were being treated by
subcutaneous injection, half an hour after the injection of 7&middot;5 mgrms. of
strychnine nitrate the alkaloid was recognised in the urine. The strychnine
treatment was continued for eight to ten days, and then stopped;
two days after the cessation, strychnine was found in the urine, but none
on the third day, and the inference drawn is that the elimination was
complete within forty-eight hours.</p>

<p>Strychnine has been detected in the blood of dogs and cats in researches
specially undertaken for that purpose, but sometimes a negative result
has been obtained, without apparent cause. Dragendorff<a name="FNanchor_444" id="FNanchor_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> gave dogs the
largest possible dose of strychnine daily. On the first few days no
strychnine was found in the urine, but later it was detected, especially if
food was withheld. M&#8217;Adam was the first who detected the absorbed
poison, recognising it in the muscles and urine of a poisoned horse, and
also in the urine of a hound. Dragendorff has found it in traces in the
kidneys, spleen, and pancreas; Gay, in different parts of the central
nervous system, and in the saliva. So far as the evidence goes, the liver
is the best organ to examine for strychnine; but all parts supplied with
blood, and most secretions, may contain small quantities of the alkaloid.
At one time it was believed that strychnine might be destroyed by
putrefaction, but the question of the decomposition of the poison in
putrid bodies may be said to be settled. So far as all evidence goes,
strychnine is an extremely stable substance, and no amount of putrescence
will destroy it. M&#8217;Adam found it in a horse a month after death,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
and in a duck eight weeks after; Nunneley in 15 animals forty-three
days after death, when the bodies were much decomposed; Roger in
a body after five weeks&#8217; interment; Richter in putrid tissues exposed for
eleven years to decomposition in open vessels; and, lastly, W. A. Noyes<a name="FNanchor_445" id="FNanchor_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a>

<p>(1.) By its alkaline reaction and its bitter taste. No substance can
possibly be strychnine unless it tastes remarkably bitter.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>(3.) If the chromate just described is treated on a porcelain plate with
a drop of pure strong sulphuric acid, a deep rich blue colour, passing
through purple into red, rapidly makes its appearance. This colour
possesses an absorption spectrum (figured at <a href="#Fig_88">p. 55</a>). Dr. Guy, neglecting
intermediate colours, aptly compares the succession&mdash;(1) to the rich
blue of the Orleans plum; (2) to the darker purple of the mulberry; and
(3) to the bright clear red of the sweet orange. These characters&mdash;viz.,
alkalinity, bitterness, and the property of precipitation by potassic
chromate in a definite crystalline form, the crystals giving the colours
detailed&mdash;belong to no other substance known save strychnine, and for
all purposes sufficiently identify the alkaloid. The same colour is
obtained by mixing a drop of sulphuric acid with strychnine and a
crystal, or speck, of any one of the following
substances:&mdash;Ferridcyanide of potash, permanganate of potash, peroxide
of lead, peroxide of manganese, and cerous hydroxide.</p>

<p>Potassic permanganate and sulphuric acid is the most delicate, and will
detect 0&middot;001 mgrm. of strychnine; cerous hydroxide is, on the other
hand, most convenient, for cerous hydroxide is white; all the others
have colours of their own. Cerous hydroxide is prepared strychnine; 3
gave 3&middot;811 of the chromate, = 78&middot;77 per cent. of strychnine.&mdash;<i>Mohr.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
by dissolving cerium oxalate in dilute sulphuric acid and precipitating
with ammonia, filtering and well washing the precipitate; and the latter
may be used while moist, and responds well to <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>100</sub> mgrm. of strychnine.</p>

<p>The influence of mixtures on the colour reactions of strychnine have
been studied by Fl&uuml;ckiger, who states:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;No strychnine reaction appears with sulphuric acid containing
chromic acid (made by dissolving 0&middot;02 grm. of pot. bichromate in 10 c.c.
of water, and then adding 30 grms. strong sulphuric acid) when brucine
and strychnine mixed in equal parts are submitted to the test; it
succeeds, however, in this proportion with sulphuric acid containing
potassium permanganate (&middot;02 grm. pot. permanganate in 10 c.c. of water,
and 30 grms. of strong sulphuric acid).</p>

<p>&#8220;If the brucine is only one-tenth of the mixture, the blue-violet colour
is obtained. A large excess of atropine does not prevent or obscure the
strychnine reaction. A solution of 1 milligrm. atropine sulphate evaporated
to dryness, together with 5 c.c. of a solution of strychnine (1&nbsp;: 100,000)
has no influence on the reaction, neither in the proportion of 1 mgrm. to
1 c.c. of the same solution; neither has cinchonine nor quinine any
effect.</p>

<p>&#8220;Morphine obscures the reaction in the following proportions:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;A solution of 0&middot;01 mgrm. strychnine evaporated with a solution of
1 mgrm. of morphine sulphate on a water-bath, yields a blurred strychnine
reaction when the residue is dissolved in sulphuric acid, and a
crystal of potassic permanganate added. But still there is evidence
whereby to <i>suspect</i> the presence of strychnine.</p>

<p>&#8220;A solution of 2 mgrms. of morphine sulphate treated in like manner
with 0&middot;01 mgrm. of strychnine yields like results.</p>

<p>&#8220;A solution of 3 mgrms. of morphine sulphate evaporated to dryness,
with a solution of 0&middot;01 mgrm. strychnine yielded results with the potassic
permanganate test the same as if no strychnine was present.</p>

<p>&#8220;A solution of 1 mgrm. of morphine sulphate, treated as above, with
a solution of 0&middot;1 mgrm. strychnine, offered positive proof of the presence
of the latter.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_448" id="FNanchor_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a></p>

<p>Dragendorff was able to render evident &middot;025 mgrm. mixed with
twenty times its weight of quin. sulphate; the same observer likewise
recognised &middot;04 mgrm. of strychnine in thirty-three times its weight of
caffeine. Veratrine is likewise not injurious.</p>

<p><b>The physiological test</b> consists in administering the substance to
some small animal (preferably to a frog), and inducing the ordinary
tetanic symptoms. It may be at once observed that if definite chemical
evidence of strychnine has been obtained, the physiological test is quite
unnecessary; and, on the other hand, should the application of a liquid or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
substance to a frog induce tetanus, while chemical evidence of the
presence of strychnine was wanting, it would be hazardous to assert that
strychnine was present, seeing that caffeine, carbolic acid, picrotoxin,
certain of the opium alkaloids, hypaphorine, some of the ptomaines, and
many other substances induce similar symptoms. The best method (if the
test is used at all) is to take two frogs,<a name="FNanchor_449" id="FNanchor_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> and insert under the skin of the one
the needle of a subcutaneous syringe, previously charged with a solution
of the substance, injecting a moderate quantity. The other frog is treated
similarly with a very dilute solution of strychnine, and the two are then
placed under small glass shades, and the symptoms observed and compared.
It is not absolutely necessary to inject the solution under the
skin, for if applied to the surface the same effects are produced; but, if
accustomed to manipulation, the operator will find the subcutaneous
application more certain, especially in dealing with minute quantities of
the alkaloid.<a name="FNanchor_450" id="FNanchor_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_449" id="Footnote_449"></a><a href="#FNanchor_449"><span class="label">[449]</span></a> A very practical disadvantage of the physiological test is the

<p><a name="Footnote_450" id="Footnote_450"></a><a href="#FNanchor_450"><span class="label">[450]</span></a> Methyl strychnine, as well as methyl brucine, has been shown by
Brown and Fraser to have an effect exactly the opposite to that of
strychnine, paralysing the muscles like curare. In the case, therefore,
of the methyl compounds, a physiological test would be very valuable,
since these compounds do not respond to the ordinary tests.</p>

proportion of each alkaloid in a mixture of strychnine and brucine, is to precipitate
them as picrates, and to destroy the brucine picrate by nitric acid after obtaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
the combined weight of the mixed picrates; then to weigh the undestroyed strychnine
picrate.</p>

<p>To carry out the process, the solution of the mixed alkaloids must be as neutral as
possible. A saturated solution of picric acid is added drop by drop to complete precipitation.
A filter paper is dried and weighed, and the precipitate collected on to
this filter paper; the precipitate is washed with cold water, dried at 105&deg;, and
weighed. This weight gives the combined weight of both strychnine and brucine
picrates.</p>

<p>The precipitate is now detached from the filter, washed into a small flask, and
heated on the water-bath for some time with nitric acid diluted to 1&middot;056 gravity
(about 11 per cent. <span class="chemform">HNO<sub>3</sub></span>). This process destroys the brucine picrate, but leaves
the strychnine picrate untouched. The acid liquid is now neutralised with ammonia
or soda, and a trace of acetic acid added; the precipitate of strychnine picrate is
now collected and weighed. The weight of this subtracted from the first weight, of
course, gives that of the brucine picrate.</p>

<p>One part of strychnine picrate is equal to 0&middot;5932 strychnine; and one part of
brucine picrate is equal to 0&middot;6324 brucine.</p>

<p>From the strychnine picrate the picric acid may be recovered and weighed by
dissolving the picrate in a mineral acid and shaking out with ether; from the acid
liquid thus deprived of picric acid the alkaloid may be separated by alkalising with
ammonia and shaking out with chloroform.</p>

<p>The recently-crystallised alkaloid has a solubility different from that
which has effloresced, the former dissolving in 320 parts of cold, and
150 parts of boiling water; whilst the latter (according to Pelletier and
Caventou) requires 500 of boiling, and 850 parts of cold water for
solution. Brucine is easily soluble in absolute, as well as in ordinary
alcohol; 1 part dissolves in 1&middot;7 of chloroform, in 60&middot;2 of benzene. Petroleum
ether, the volatile and fatty oils and glycerine, dissolve the alkaloid
slightly, amyl alcohol freely; it is insoluble in <i>anhydrous</i> ether. The
behaviour of brucine in the subliming cell is described at <a href="#Page_260">p. 260</a>. Anhydrous
brucine melts in a tube at 178&deg;. The alcoholic solution of brucine
turns the plane of polarisation to the left [&#945;]<i>r</i> = -11&middot;27&deg;. The taste is
bitter and acrid. Soubeiran maintains that it can be recognised if 1
part is dissolved in 500,000 parts of water. If nitric trioxide be passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
into an alcoholic solution of brucine, first brucine nitrate is formed; but
this passes again into solution, from which, after a time, a heavy,
granular, blood-red precipitate separates: it consists of dinitro-brucine
(<span class="chemform">C<sub>23</sub>H<sub>24</sub>(NO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub></span>). Brucine fully neutralises acids, and forms salts,
which are for the most part crystalline. The neutral sulphate
(<span class="chemform">C<sub>23</sub>H<sub>25</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>SH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub></span> + <span class="chemform">3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</span>) is in long needles, easily soluble in water.
The acetate is not crystalline, that of strychnine is so (<a href="#Page_321">p. 321</a>).</p>

<p>Brucine is precipitated by ammonia, by the caustic and carbonated
alkalies, and by most of the group reagents. Ammonia does not precipitate
brucine, if in excess; on the other hand, strychnine comes down if
excess of ammonia is added immediately. This has been proposed as a
method of separation; if the two alkaloids are present in acid solution,
ammonia in excess is added, and the solution is immediately filtered;
the quantitative results are, however, not good, the strychnine precipitate
being invariably contaminated by brucine.</p>

<p>Chromate and dichromate of potassium give no precipitate with neutral
salts of brucine; on the other hand, strychnine chromate is at once
formed if present. It might, therefore, be used to separate strychnine
from brucine. The author has attempted this method, but the results

strychnine and that of brucine on man or animals is not great. Mays
states that strychnine affects more the anterior, brucine the posterior
extremities. In strychnine poisoning, convulsions occur early, and
invariably take place before death; but death may occur from brucine
without any convulsions, and in any case they develop late. Brucine
diminishes local sensibility when applied to the skin; strychnine does
not.<a name="FNanchor_454" id="FNanchor_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> In a physiological sense, brucine may be considered a diluted
strychnine. The lethality of brucine, especially as compared with
strychnine, has been investigated by F. A. Falck.<a name="FNanchor_455" id="FNanchor_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> He experimented on
11 rabbits, injecting subcutaneously brucine nitrate, in doses of varying
magnitude, from 100 mgrms. down to 20 mgrms. per kilogram of body-weight.
He found that brucine presented three stages of symptoms.
In the first, the respiration is quickened; in 3 of the 11 cases a strange
injection of the ear was noticed; during this period the pupils may be
dilated. In the second stage, there are tetanic convulsions, trismus,
opisthotonus, oppressed respiration, and dilated pupils. In the third
stage, the animal is moribund. Falck puts the minimum lethal dose for
rabbits at 23 mgrms. per kilo. Strychnine kills 3&middot;06 times more quickly
than brucine, the intensity of the action of strychnine relative to that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
brucine being as 1&nbsp;: 117&middot;4. Falck has also compared the minimum lethal
dose of strychnine and brucine with the tetanising opium alkaloids, as
shown in the following table:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p><a name="Sect_403" id="Sect_403"></a>&sect; 403. Tests.&mdash;If to a solution of brucine in strong alcohol a little
methyl iodide is added, at the end of a few minutes circular rosettes of
crystal groups appear (see <a href="#Fig_377">fig.</a>): they are composed of methyl brucine
iodide (<span class="chemform">C<sub>23</sub>H<sub>25</sub>(CH<sub>3</sub>)N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>HI</span>). Crystals identical in shape are also
obtained if an alcoholic solution of iodine, or hydriodic acid with iodine,
is added to an alcoholic solution of brucine. A solution of strychnine
gives with methyl iodide no similar reaction. Strychnine in alcoholic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
solution, mixed with, brucine in no way interferes with the test. The
methyl iodide test may be confirmed by the action of nitric acid. With
that reagent it produces a scarlet colour, passing into blood-red, into
yellow-red, and finally ending in yellow. This can be made something
more than a mere colour test, for it is possible to obtain a crystalline
body from the action of nitric acid on brucine. If a little of the latter
be put in a test-tube, and treated with nitric acid of 1&middot;4 specific gravity
(immersing the test-tube in cold water to moderate the action), the red
colour is produced. On spectroscopic examination of the blood-red
liquid a broad, well-marked absorption band is seen, the centre of which
(<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_55">page 55</a>) is between E. &amp; F. [W. L. about 500]. There is also a
development of nitric oxide and carbon dioxide, and the formation of
methyl nitrite, oxalic acid, and kakotelin (<span class="chemform">C<sub>23</sub>H<sub>26</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub></span> + <span class="chemform">5NHO<sub>3</sub></span> =

On diluting abundantly
with water, the kakotelin separates in yellow flocks, and may be
crystallised out of dilute hydrochloric or dilute nitric acid in the form of
yellow or orange-red crystals, very insoluble in water, but dissolving readily
in dilute acid. On removal by dilution of the product just named, neutralisation
with ammonia, and addition of a solution of chloride of calcium, the
oxalate of lime is thrown down. The nitric acid test is, therefore, a
combined test, consisting of&mdash;the production by the action of nitric
acid (1) of a red colour; (2) of yellow scales or crystals insoluble in
water; (3) of oxalic acid. No alkaloid save brucine is known to give
this reaction.</p>

<p>There are other methods of producing the colour test. If a few
drops of nitric acid are mixed with the substance in a test-tube, and
then sulphuric acid cautiously added, so as to form a layer at the bottom,
at the junction of the liquids a red zone, passing into yellow, is seen.</p>

<p>A solution of brucine is also coloured red by chlorine gas, ammonia
changing the colour into yellow.</p>

<p>Fl&uuml;ckiger<a name="FNanchor_456" id="FNanchor_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> has proposed as a test mercurous nitrate, in aqueous solution
with a little free nitric acid. On adding this reagent to a solution
of brucine salt, and gently warming, a fine carmine colour is developed.</p>

<p>In regard to the separation of brucine from organic fluids or tissues,
the process already detailed for strychnine suffices. It is of very great
importance to ascertain whether both strychnine and brucine are present
or not&mdash;the presence of both pointing to nux vomica or one of its preparations.
The presence of brucine may, of course, be owing to impure
strychnine; but if found in the tissues, that solution of the question is
improbable, the commercial strychnine of the present day being usually
pure, or at the most containing so small a quantity of brucine as would
hardly be separated from the tissues.</p>

dissolve in about 6000 parts of water at 14&deg;&mdash;48 parts of 90 per cent. alcohol, and
106 parts of pure ether. The alkaloid gives a fine magenta colour with perchloric

<p><b>Quebrachine</b> (<span class="chemform">C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>26</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub></span>) crystallises in colourless needles, melting-point (with

soluble in cold alcohol, but easily in hot. The alkaloid, treated with sulphuric acid,
and peroxide of lead, strikes a beautiful blue colour. It also gives with sulphuric
acid and potassic chromate the strychnine colours. Quebrachine, dissolved in
sulphuric acid containing iron, becomes violet-blue, passing into brown. The alkaloid,
treated with strong sulphuric acid, becomes brown; on adding a crystal of
potassic nitrate, a blue colour is developed; on now neutralising with caustic soda
no red coloration is perceived. Dragendorff has recently studied the best method of
extracting these alkaloids for toxicological purposes. He recommends extraction of
the substances with sulphuric acid holding water, and shaking up with solvents.
Aspidospermine is not extracted by petroleum ether or benzene from an acid watery
extract, but readily by chloroform or by amyl alcohol. It is also separated from the
same solution, alkalised by ammonia, by either amyl alcohol or chloroform; with
difficulty by petroleum ether; some is dissolved by benzene. Quebrachine may be
extracted from an acid solution by chloroform, but not by petroleum ether. Alkalised
by ammonia, it dissolves freely in chloroform and in amyl alcohol. Traces are
taken up by petroleum, somewhat more by benzene. Aspidospermine is gradually
decomposed in the body, but Quebrachine is more resistant, and has been found in
the stomach, intestines, blood, and urine. The toxicological action of the bark
ranks it with the tetanic class of poisons. In this country it does not seem likely
to attain any importance as a poison.</p>

one-half; at the expiration of a quarter of an hour, it was only one-third of its
original frequency; and in twenty minutes, it was so shallow and irregular that it
could no longer be counted with accuracy. In all their experiments they found
that the respiratory function was abolished before reflex and voluntary motion had
become extinct. In several instances the animals could withdraw their legs when
their toes were pinched, days after the most careful observations had failed to detect
the existence of any respiratory movement. The heart was seen beating through
the chest wall long after the complete abolition of respiration.</p>

<p>In their experiments on warm-blooded animals (cats), they noticed that in a few
minutes the respirations were slowed down to 12 and even to 8, and there was
loss of power of the posterior extremities, while at short intervals the upper half of
the body was convulsed. In about half an hour paralysis of the hind limbs was
almost complete, and the respiratory movements so shallow that they could not be
counted. In the case of a dog, after all respiration had ceased tracheotomy was
performed, and air pumped in: the animal recovered.</p>

<p>Ringer and Murrell consider that gelsemine produces no primary quickening of
the respiration, that it has no direct action on either the diaphragm or intercostal
muscles, that it paralyses neither the phrenic nor the intercostal nerves, and that it
diminishes the rate of respiration after both vagi have been divided. They do not
consider that gelsemine acts on the cord through Setschenow&#8217;s inhibitory centre, but
that it destroys reflex power by its direct action on the cord, and that probably it
has no influence on the motor nerves. Dr. Burdon Sanderson has also investigated
the action of gelsemine on the respiration, more especially in relation to the movements
of the diaphragm. He operated upon rabbits; the animal being narcotised
by chloral, a small spatula, shaped like a teaspoon, was introduced into the peritoneal
cavity through an opening in the linea alba, and passed upwards in front of
the liver until its convex surface rested against the under side of the centrum tendineum.
The stem of the spatula was brought into connection with a lever, by
means of which its to-and-fro movements (and consequently that of the diaphragm)
were inscribed. The first effect is to augment the depth but not the frequency of the
respiratory movements; the next is to diminish the action of the diaphragm both in
extent and frequency. This happens in accordance with the general principle
applicable to most cases of toxic action&mdash;viz., that paresis of a central organ is
preceded by over-action. The diminution of movement upon the whole is progressive,
but this progression is interrupted, because the blood is becoming more and
more venous, and, therefore, the phenomena of asphyxia are mixed up with the
toxical effects. Dr. Sanderson concludes that the drug acts by paralysing the
automatic respiratory centre; the process of extinction, which might be otherwise
expected to be gradual and progressive, is prevented from being so by the intervention
of disturbances of which the explanation is to be found in the imperfect arterialisation
of the circulating blood. Ringer and Murrell have also experimented upon the
action of gelsemine on the frog&#8217;s heart. In all cases it decreased the number of
beats; a small fatal dose produced a white contracted heart, a large fatal dose, a
dark dilated heart; in either case arrest of the circulation of course followed.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_411" id="Sect_411"></a>&sect; 411. <b>Effects on Man.</b>&mdash;The preparations used in medicine are the fluid extract

well as the active principle. There are several cases on record of gelsemine, or the
plant itself, having been taken with fatal effect.<a name="FNanchor_462" id="FNanchor_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> Besides a marked effect on the
respiration, there is an effect upon the eye, better seen in man than in the lower
animals; the motor nerves of the eye are attacked first, objects cannot be fixed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347"><span class="fsize110">[347]</span></a></span>
apparently dodging their position, the eyelids become paralysed, droop, and cannot
be raised by an effort of the will; the pupils are largely dilated, and at the same
time a feeling of lightness has been complained of in the tongue; it ascends gradually
to the roof of the mouth, and the pronunciation is slurred. There is some paresis of
the extremities, and they refuse to support the body; the respiration becomes
laboured, and the pulse rises in frequency to 120 or 130 beats per minute, but the
mind remains clear. The symptoms occur in about an hour and a half after taking
an overdose of the drug, and, if not excessive, soon disappear, leaving no unpleasantness
behind. If, on the other hand, the case proceeds to a fatal end, the respiratory
trouble increases, and there may be convulsions, and a course very similar to that
seen in experimenting on animals. Large doses are especially likely to produce
tetanus, which presents some clinical differences distinguishing it from strychnine
tetanus. Gelsemine tetanus is always preceded by a loss of voluntary reflex power,
respiration ceases before the onset of convulsions, the posterior extremities are most
affected, and irritation fails to excite another paroxysm till the lapse of some seconds,
as if the exhausted cord required time to renew its energy; finally, the convulsions
only last a short time.</p>

acid may be extracted with acid water, and identified. On extracting with water
acidified with sulphuric acid, and shaking up the acid liquid with chloroform, the
gelsemic acid (&aelig;sculin?) is dissolved, and the gelsemine left in the liquid. The
chloroform on evaporation leaves gelsemic acid in little micro-crystals; it may be
identified by (1) its crystallising in little tufts of crystals; (2) its strong fluorescent
properties, one part dissolved in 15,000,000 parts of water showing a marked fluorescence,
which is increased by the addition of an alkali; and (3) by splitting up into
sugar and another body on boiling with a mineral acid. After separation of gelsemic
acid, the gelsemine is obtained by alkalising the liquid, and shaking up with fresh

use being as a local an&aelig;sthetic. Chemically cocaine is a derivative of ecgonin, being
ecgonin-methyl-ester. It has a pyridine nucleus, and may be written <span class="chemform">C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>4</sub>N(CH<sub>3</sub>)&mdash;</span><span class="chemform">H<sub>3</sub>CHO&mdash;</span><span class="chemform">(COC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)&mdash;</span><span class="chemform">CH<sub>2</sub>COOCH<sub>3</sub></span>,

officinal. Gelatine discs, weighing 1&middot;31 mgrms. (<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>50</sub> grain), and each
containing 0&middot;33 mgrm. (<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>200</sub> grain) of the salt are officinal, and used by
ophthalmic surgeons. A solution of the hydrochlorate, containing
10 per cent. of cocaine hydrochlorate and (for the purposes of preserving
the solution) 0&middot;15 per cent. of salicylic acid is also officinal. Stronger
solutions may also be met with; for instance, a 20 per cent. solution in
oil of cloves for external application in cases of neuralgia.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_416" id="Sect_416"></a>&sect; 416. <b>Separation of Cocaine and Tests.</b>&mdash;Cocaine may be shaken
out of solutions made slightly alkaline by ammonia by treatment with
benzene; it also passes into petroleum ether under the same circumstances.
The best method is to extract a solution, made feebly alkaline,
thoroughly by ether, and then shake it out by benzene and evaporate the
separated benzene at the ordinary air temperature. The property of the
alkaloid to melt at or below the temperature of boiling water, and the
ready decomposition into benzoic acid and other products, render cocaine
easy of identification. If, for instance, a small particle of cocaine is put
in a tube, a drop of strong sulphuric acid added and warmed by the
water-bath, colourless crystals of benzoic acid sublime along the tube, and
an aromatic odour is produced.</p>

<p>Fl&uuml;ckiger has recommended the production of benzoate of iron as a
useful test both for cocaine and for cocaine hydrochlorate.</p>

<p>One drop of a dilute solution of ferric chloride added to a solution of
20 mgrms. of cocaine hydrochlorate in 2 c.c. of water, gives a yellow
fluid, which becomes red on boiling from the production of iron benzoate.
This reaction is of little use unless a solution of the same strength of
ferric chloride, but to which the substance to be tested has not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
added, is boiled at the same time for comparison, because all solutions of
ferric chloride deepen in colour on heating.</p>

<p>A solution of the alkaloid evaporated to dryness on the water-bath,
after being acidulated with nitric acid, and then a few drops of alcoholic
solution of potash or soda added, develops an odour of benzoic ethyl-ester.
Cocaine hydrochlorate, when triturated with calomel, blackens
by the slightest humidity or by moistening it with alcohol. Cocaine in
solution is precipitated by most of the group reagents, but is not affected
by mercuric chloride, picric acid, nor potassic bichromate.</p>

<p>Added to the tests above mentioned, there is the physiological action;
cocaine dilates the pupil, tastes bitter, and, for the time, arrests sensation;
hence the after-effect on the tongue is a sensation of numbness.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_417" id="Sect_417"></a>&sect; 417. <b>Symptoms.</b>&mdash;A large number of accidents occur each year from
the external application of cocaine; few, however, end fatally. Cocaine
has thus produced poisonous symptoms when applied to the eye, to the
rectum, to the gums, to the urethra, and to various other parts. There
have been a few fatal cases, both from its external and internal administration;
Mannheim, for example, has collected eleven of such
instances.</p>

<p>The action of cocaine is twofold; there is an action on the central and
the peripheral nervous system. In small doses cocaine excites the spinal
cord and the brain; in large it may produce convulsions and then paralysis.
The peripheral action is seen in the numbing of sensation. There
is always interference with the accommodation of vision, and dilatation
of the pupil. The eyelids are wider apart than normal, and there may be
some protrusion of the eyeball.</p>

<p>The usual course of an acute case of poisoning is a feeling of dryness
in the nose and throat, difficulty of swallowing, faintness, and there is
often vomiting; the pulse is quickened; there is first cerebral excitement,
followed usually by great mental depression. Occasionally there
is an eruption on the skin. Hyper&aelig;sthesia of the skin is followed by
great diminution of sensation, the pupils, as before stated, are dilated, the
eyes protruding, the eyelids wide open, the face is pale, and the perspiration
profuse. Convulsions and paralysis may terminate the scene.
Death takes place from paralysis of the breathing centre; therefore the
heart beats after the cessation of respiration. As an antidote, nitrite of
amyl has apparently been used with success.</p>

<p>There is a form of chronic poisoning produced from the taking of small
doses of cocaine daily. The symptoms are very various, and are referable
to disturbance of the digestive organs, and to the effect on the nervous
system. The patients become extremely emaciated, and it seems to
produce a special form of mania.</p>

<h4>V.&mdash;The Aconite Group of Alkaloids.</h4>

<p><a name="Sect_421" id="Sect_421"></a>&sect; 421. The officinal aconite is the <i>Aconitum napellus</i>&mdash;monkshood or
wolfsbane&mdash;a very common garden plant in this country, and one
cultivated for medicinal purposes. Many varieties of aconite exist in
other regions, which either are, or could be, imported. Of these the
most important is the <i>Aconitum ferox</i>, a native of the Himalayan mountains,
imported from India.</p>

<p>All the aconites, so far as known, are extremely poisonous, and it
appears probable that different species contain different alkaloids. The
root of <i>A. napellus</i> is from 2 to 4 inches long, conical in shape, brown
externally, and white internally. The leaves are completely divided at
the base into five wedge-shaped lobes, each of the five lobes being again
divided into three linear segments. The numerous seeds are three-sided,
irregularly twisted, wrinkled, of a dark-brown colour, in length one-sixth
of an inch, and weighing 25 to the grain (<i>Guy</i>). The whole plant is one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
of great beauty, from 2 to 6 feet high, and having a terminal spike
of conspicuous blue flowers. The root has been fatally mistaken for
horse-radish, an error not easily accounted for, since no similarity exists
between them.</p>

<p>That is to say that 100 parts of aconitine, according to theory, should
yield:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Acetic acid, 9&middot;37 per cent.; benzoic acid, 18&middot;85 per cent.; and aconine,
77&middot;52 per cent.</p>

<p>Pure aconitine has a tube melting-point of 188&middot;6&deg;. The behaviour of a
sample of Merck&#8217;s aconitine in the subliming cell, which had a melting-point
of 184&deg;, was as described at <a href="#Page_259">page 259</a>.</p>

<p>Aconitine dissolves in water at 22&deg; in the proportion of 1 in 4431
(<i>Dunstan</i>); it is soluble in 37 of absolute alcohol, 64 of anhydrous ether,
5&middot;5 parts of chloroform and benzene (<i>A. Jurgens</i>); it has basic properties,
and a cold watery solution has an alkaline reaction to cochineal,
but not to litmus nor to phenol-phthalein. Aconitine is not precipitated
by mercuric potassium iodide, but gives a voluminous precipitate with an
aqueous solution of iodine in potassium iodide.</p>

<p>It gives a crystalline yellow gold compound with gold chloride, which
has a melting-point of 135&middot;5&deg;, and according to its composition,
<span class="chemform">C<sub>33</sub>H<sub>45</sub>NO<sub>12</sub>HAuCl<sub>4</sub></span>, should give 19&middot;9 per cent. of gold.</p>

<p>Aconitine is best extracted from the plant, or from organic matters
generally, by a 1 per cent. sulphuric acid; this strength is stated not to
hydrolyse aconitine if acting in the cold; after purifying the acid liquid
by shaking it with amyl alcohol, and then with chloroform, <i>always
operating in the cold</i>, the liquid is precipitated by ammonia in very
slight excess, and the liquid shaken with ether; the ether is removed,
dehydrated by standing over calcium chloride, and then evaporated
spontaneously; should the aconitine be mixed with the other alkaloids,
advantage can be taken of the method of separating aconitine by converting
it into hydrobromide, as described under &#8220;Benzoyl-aconine.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="Sect_425" id="Sect_425"></a>&sect; 425. <b>Tests for Aconitine.</b>&mdash;The most satisfactory and the most
delicate is the physiological test; the minutest trace of an aconite-holding
liquid, applied to the tongue or lips, causes a peculiar numbing, tingling
sensation which, once felt, can readily be remembered.</p>

<p>An alkaloidal substance which, heated in a tube, melts approximately
near the melting-point of aconitine, and gives off an acid vapour, would
render one suspicious of aconitine, for most alkaloids give off alkaline
vapours. Aconitine also may, by heating with dilute acids, be made to
readily yield benzoic acid, an acid easy of identification. Aconitine dissolved
in nitric acid, evaporated to dryness, and then treated with
alcoholic potash, gives off an unmistakable odour of benzoic ester.</p>

<p>Should there be sufficient aconitine recovered to convert it into the
gold salt, the properties of the gold salt (that is, its melting-point, and
the percentage of gold left after burning) assist materially in the
identification.</p>

<p>A minute quantity of aconitine dissolved in water, acidified with acetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
acid, and a particle of <span class="chemform">KI</span> added and the solution allowed to evaporate,
gives crystals of aconitine hydriodide, from which water will dissolve
out the <span class="chemform">KI</span>. Iodine water gives a precipitate of a reddish-brown colour

aconitine by heating an aqueous solution of the sulphate or hydrochloride
in a closed tube at 120&deg;-130&deg; for two or three hours, a molecule
of acetic acid (9&middot;27 per cent.) being split off, and benzoyl-aconine left.</p>

<p>It may be separated from the mixed alkaloids of the <i>Aconitum
napellus</i> by dissolving in a 5 per cent. solution of hydrobromic acid
(excess of acid being avoided), precipitating with a slight excess of
ammonia, and shaking out with ether. The residue left after the ether
is evaporated chiefly consists of aconitine; it is dissolved in just sufficient
hydrobromic acid and the exactly neutral hydrobromate solution
allowed to evaporate spontaneously in a desiccator; crystals of aconitine
hydrobromide separate out, the mother liquor containing some benzoyl-aconine
and &#8220;homonapelline.&#8221; The aqueous solution which has been
exhausted with ether is now shaken out with chloroform. This chloroform
solution contains most of the benzoyl-aconine, and on separation
the residue is dissolved in just sufficient hydrochloric acid to form a
neutral solution; this solution is concentrated on the water-bath with
constant stirring, crystals of the hydrochloride form, and are filtered off
from time to time and washed with a little cold water, the washings
being added to the original liquid; the different fractions are mixed
together, and the process repeated until they have a melting-point of
268&deg;. Benzoyl-aconine is obtained from the hydrochloride by precipitating
the aqueous solution by the addition of dilute ammonia, and
extracting the solution with ether; the solution in ether is washed with
water, dried by means of calcium chloride, and then distilled off.
Benzoyl-aconine is left as a transparent colourless non-crystalline varnish
of a melting-point near 125&deg;.</p>

<p>The solution in water is alkaline to litmus. The base is readily
soluble in alcohol, in chloroform, and in ether. The alcoholic solution
is dextrorotatory. The solutions are bitter, but do not give the tingling
sensation characteristic of aconitine. The hydrochloride, the hydrobromide,
the hydriodide, and the nitrate have been obtained in a
crystalline state. The most characteristic salt is, however, the aurochlor
derivative. When aqueous solutions of benzoyl-aconine chloride and
auric chloride are mixed, a yellow precipitate is thrown down, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
(dissolved in alcohol, after being dried over calcium chloride, and slowly
evaporated in a desiccator) deposits colourless crystals entirely different
from the yellow crystals of aconitine gold chloride. These crystals have
the composition <span class="chemform">C<sub>31</sub>H<sub>42</sub>(AuCl<sub>2</sub>)NO<sub>11</sub></span>, and therefore, by theory, should
yield 22&middot;6 per cent. of gold, and 8&middot;2 per cent. of chlorine.</p>

<p>By hydrolysis benzoyl-aconine yields benzoic acid, which can be
shaken out of an acid solution by ether and identified; one molecule of
benzoic acid is formed from one molecule of benzoyl-aconine. Twenty per
cent. of benzoic acid should, according to the formula, be obtained;

<p>Benzoic acid in the subliming cell begins to give a cloud at about
77&deg;-80&deg;, and at or near 100&deg; sublimes most rapidly.</p>

<p>Benzoic acid, recovered from an acid solution by shaking out with
ether, may be recognised as follows:&mdash;To the film left on evaporating off
the ether add a drop of <span class="chemform">H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub></span>, and a few crystals of sodic nitrate, and
heat gently for a short time; pour the clear liquid into ammonia water,
and add a drop of ammonium sulphide. A red-brown colour indicates
benzoic acid. The <i>rationale</i> of the test is as follows:&mdash;Dinitro-benzoic
acid is first formed, and next, by the action of ammonium
sulphide, this is converted into the red-brown ammonium diamidobenzoate.&mdash;E.

from benzoyl-aconine by a molecule of water; picraconitine is obtained
by keeping aconitine at its melting-point (188&deg;-190&deg;) for some time,
when acetic acid distils over and pyraconitine is left. Pyraconitine is
an amorphous varnish, sparingly soluble in water, but readily dissolving
in alcohol, chloroform, and ether; it gives a pale yellow precipitate with
gold chloride, and forms crystalline salts with hydriodic, hydrobromic,
and hydrochloric acids. Pyraconitine readily undergoes hydrolysis by
the action of dilute acids, or by potash or soda, or with water in a closed
tube; the products are benzoic acid and an alkaloid, to which the name
of pyraconine has been given.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_428" id="Sect_428"></a>&sect; 428. <b>Pyraconine</b>, <span class="chemform">C<sub>24</sub>H<sub>37</sub>NO<sub>9</sub></span>.&mdash;This base is anhydro-aconine, the
formula differing from aconine by one atom of water. It is amorphous,
closely resembling aconine; it is soluble in water and ether; the aqueous
solution has a somewhat sweet taste, and is l&aelig;vorotatory; it combines
with acids to form crystalline salts, which are very soluble in water.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_429" id="Sect_429"></a>&sect; 429. <b>Aconine</b>, <span class="chemform">C<sub>24</sub>H<sub>39</sub>NO<sub>10</sub></span>, m.p. 132&deg;.&mdash;Aconine does not crystallise.
Its aqueous solution is decidedly alkaline, and, like aconitine, it is l&aelig;vorotatory,
although to a less degree. Its taste is bitter, but causes no tingling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
sensation. Aconine is very soluble in water or alcohol, and slightly
in chloroform, but insoluble in ether or in petroleum ether. It does,
however, dissolve, in the presence of aconitine, slightly in ether. The
aqueous solutions reduce the salts of gold and silver, and also Fehling&#8217;s
solution. A solution of aconine gives precipitates with the general alkaloidal
reagents; with mercuric chloride it gives a copious yellow precipitate,
which darkens on standing.</p>

<p>Aconine hydrochloride, the hydriodide, the hydrobromide, and the sulphate,
have all been crystallised; solutions of these salts are l&aelig;vorotatory.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_430" id="Sect_430"></a>&sect; 430. <b>Commercial Aconitine and the Lethal Dose of Aconitine.</b>&mdash;Commercial
aconitine has in the past varied in appearance from that of
a gummy amorphous mass up to a purer kind in white crystals.</p>

<p>Professor Dunstan<a name="FNanchor_470" id="FNanchor_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> has recently examined fourteen samples, some of
them of considerable age, and only found two samples (one of English,
another of German make) which approached in melting-point and crystalline
appearance pure aconitine; the one, the English, melted at 186&deg;-187&deg;,
and contained about 3 per cent. of benzoyl-aconine; the other, a
German specimen, was almost pure; the melting-point was 187&middot;5&deg;. At
the present time it is, however, not difficult to obtain fairly pure crystalline
aconitine, and to assay it accurately by determining the proportion
of acetic and benzoic acids. The physiological action of commercial
aconitine is, however, in all cases the same, the difference being in
quantitative not qualitative action; in the small doses usually administered,
the physiological action depends wholly upon the true aconitine
present, the other bases being practically without toxic action. Professor
Plugge<a name="FNanchor_471" id="FNanchor_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> has made some researches on the fatal dose (for the lower
animals) of Petit&#8217;s, Merck&#8217;s, and Friedl&auml;nder&#8217;s aconitine nitrate, which in
1882 were the purest in commerce. He administered the following doses
to the animals mentioned:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The conclusions Plugge draws from his researches are that Petit&#8217;s
aconitine was at least eight times stronger than that of Merck, and
seventy times more toxic than that of Friedl&auml;nder, while Merck&#8217;s &#8220;aconitine
again was twenty to thirty times stronger than Friedl&auml;nder&#8217;s.&#8221; He
was inclined to put seven commercial samples which he has examined
in the following diminishing order of toxicity:&mdash;(1) Petit&#8217;s crystalline
aconitine nitrate; (2) Morson&#8217;s aconitine nitrate; (3) Hottot&#8217;s aconitine
nitrate; (4) Hopkins &amp; Williams&#8217; pseudaconitine; (5) Merck&#8217;s aconitine
nitrate; (6) Schuchart&#8217;s aconitine sulphate; and (7) Friedl&auml;nder&#8217;s aconitine
nitrate.</p>

<p>From a study of Dr. Harley&#8217;s experiments,<a name="FNanchor_472" id="FNanchor_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> however, made a few
years ago, there would appear to have been but little difference between
the activity of Petit&#8217;s and Morson&#8217;s aconitine. Dr. Harley experimented
on a young cat, 3 lbs. in weight, and nearly killed it with a <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>1000</sub> of a
grain of Morson&#8217;s aconitine; two other cats, also weighing 3 lbs. each,
died in seven and a half hours and three-quarters of an hour respectively,
killed from a subcutaneous dose of of a grain. Reducing these values
to the ordinary equivalents, the dose, after which the cat recovered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
difficulty, is equal to about &middot;048 mgrm. per kilo., while a certainly fatal
dose is &middot;092 mgrm. per kilo.; therefore, it seems likely that the least
fatal dose for Morson&#8217;s, as for Petit&#8217;s, is some number between &middot;075 and
&middot;09 mgrm. per kilo.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_472" id="Footnote_472"></a><a href="#FNanchor_472"><span class="label">[472]</span></a> &#8220;On the Action and Use of Aconitine,&#8221; <i>St. Thos. Hosp. Report</i>,
1874.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>Man is evidently more sensitive to aconitine than any of the dogs or
cats experimented upon, since, in the German cases to be recorded, 1&middot;6
mgrm. of Petit&#8217;s aconitine nitrate, taken by the mouth, gave rise to
symptoms so violent that it was evidently a dangerous dose, while 4
mgrms. were rapidly fatal; but if man took the same amount per kilo.
as dogs or cats, he would require a little over 6 mgrms. to be certainly
fatal. It seems, then, from the evidence obtainable, that &middot;03 grain (2
mgrms.) is about the least fatal dose for an adult man of standard weight.
This dose is equal to &middot;028 mgrm. per kilo., and, of course, refers either
to Morson&#8217;s aconitine or French aconitine, the alkaloid being taken by
the mouth. If given by subcutaneous injection, probably 1&middot;5 mgrm.
would kill, for the whole of the poison is then thrown on the circulation
at one time, and there is no chance of its elimination by vomiting.</p>

<p>The lethal dose of the pure alkaloid being even approximately settled,
it is possible to get a more exact idea as to the suitable medicinal dose
of the tincture and extract, and also to study more profitably the &#8220;quantitative
toxicity.&#8221; The English officinal tincture, although variable in
strength, may for our purposes be regarded as averaging 1 per cent. of
alkaloid&mdash;that is, in every 100 parts by volume there will be 1 part of
the alkaloid by weight, and Fleming&#8217;s tincture may be considered as one-third
stronger, containing in every 100 parts 1&middot;3 part of alkaloid. The
medicinal dose of the P.B. tincture is laid down as from 5 to 15 min.&mdash;equal
to from &middot;005 to &middot;015 grain of aconitine. The German pharmacop&#339;ia
gives the maximum single dose as 1 c.c. (say 15 mins.), and the maximum
quantity to be taken in the twenty-four hours as four times that quantity.
As before stated, 2 mgrms. (&middot;030 grain) of aconitine being considered a
fatal dose, this is equivalent to about 2 c.c. (30 mins.) of the P.B.
tincture, or to 1&middot;2 c.c. (20 mins.) of Fleming&#8217;s tincture in a single dose;
and on these theoretical grounds I should consider this dose dangerous,
and in the absence of prompt treatment likely to be fatal to an adult man.
The usual least fatal dose laid down in medical toxicological works, however,
is greater than this&mdash;viz., 3&middot;75 c.c. (a drachm).</p>

<p>In 1863 a woman took 70 minims of Fleming&#8217;s tincture, and a grain
of acetate of morphine, and died in about four hours; but as this was a
complex case of poisoning, it is not of much value. Fifteen minims of
the tincture caused very serious symptoms in the case of a woman under
the care of Dr. Topham,<a name="FNanchor_473" id="FNanchor_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> the effects lasting many hours. Probably the
smallest quantity of the tincture recorded as having destroyed life is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
the case of Dr. Male, of Birmingham.<a name="FNanchor_474" id="FNanchor_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> He died from the effects of 80
drops taken in ten doses, extending over a period of four days&mdash;the largest
dose at any one time being 10 drops, the total quantity would perhaps
equal &middot;08 grain of aconitine.</p>

<p>The P.B. extract is not a very satisfactory preparation, varying much
in strength. It may be taken to average about &middot;6 per cent., and if so,
applying the same reasoning as before, from &middot;26 to &middot;32 grm. (4 to 5 grains)
would be a fatal dose.<a name="FNanchor_475" id="FNanchor_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> On the other hand, there is an alcoholic extract
which is very powerful, and averages 5 per cent. of aconitine: 40 mgrms.
(&middot;6 grain) of this extract would be likely to be fatal. With regard to
the root itself, 3&middot;8 grms. (60 grains) have been known to produce death,
and from the average alkaloidal contents it is probable that &middot;648 grm.
(10 grains) would be a highly dangerous dose. Dunstan&#8217;s researches will
now alter probably the whole of the pharmacy of aconite, and the tendency
will be to make the preparations of greater activity, and, consequently,
to make the dangerous doses smaller than formerly.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_475" id="Footnote_475"></a><a href="#FNanchor_475"><span class="label">[475]</span></a> But there is a case reported by Dr. Vachell, of Cardiff, in which
2 grains of extract of aconite taken in pills proved fatal. Now 2 grains
is the medicinal dose, laid down as a maximum in the pharmacop&#339;ia; a
complete revolution is, therefore, necessary in the use of these active
remedies. No extract or tincture should be used until its approximate
strength in active principles is determined.</p>

and upon so many classes of animals as aconitine in different forms; but
there does not seem to be any essential difference in the symptoms produced
in different animals save that which is explained by the organisation
of the life-form under experiment.</p>

<p><b>Insects.</b>&mdash;The author has made experiments with the active principles
of aconite upon blow-flies. An extract was made by allowing the ordinary
tincture to evaporate spontaneously at the temperature of the atmosphere.
If a minute dot of this is placed upon the head of a blow-fly, absorption
of the active principle takes place in from fifteen to thirty minutes, and
marked symptoms result. The symptoms consist essentially of muscular
weakness, inability to fly, and to walk up perpendicular surfaces; there
is also, in all cases, a curious entanglement of the legs, and very often
extrusion of the proboscis; trembling of the legs and muscular twitchings
are frequent. A progressive paralysis terminates in from four to five
hours in death; the death is generally so gradual that it is difficult to
know when the event occurs, but in one case there were violent movements
of the body, and sudden death.<a name="FNanchor_476" id="FNanchor_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Fish.</b>&mdash;The action on fish has been studied by Schulz and Praag.
There is rapid loss of power and diminished breathing; the respiration
seems difficult, and the fish rapidly die.</p>

<p><b>Reptiles&mdash;Frogs.</b>&mdash;The most recent experiments on frogs are those of
Plugge, and although his interpretation of the phenomena in some points
is different from that of previous observers, the symptoms themselves are,
as might have been expected, not different from those described by
Achscharumow, L. v. Praag, and others. Plugge found no qualitative
difference in the action of any of the commercial samples of aconitine.
This fact gives the necessary value to all the old experiments, for we
now know that, although they were performed with impure or weak
preparations, yet there is no reason to believe that the symptoms
described were due to any other but the alkaloid aconitine in varying
degrees of purity or dilution. Frogs show very quickly signs of weakness
in the muscular power; the respiration invariably becomes laboured, and
ceases after a few minutes; the heart&#8217;s action becomes slowed, irregular,
and then stops in diastole. The poisoned heart, while still pulsating,
cannot be arrested either by electrical stimulation of the vagus or by irritation
of the sinus, nor when once arrested can any further contraction
be excited in it. Opening of the mouth and apparent efforts to vomit,
Plugge observed both with <i>Rana esculenta</i> and <i>Rana temporaria</i>. He
considers them almost invariable signs of aconitine poisoning. A separation
of mucus from the surface of the body of the frog is also very
constantly observed. Dilatation of the pupils is frequent, but not constant;
there may be convulsions, both of a clonic and tonic character,
before death, but fibrillar twitchings are seldom. (With regard to the
dose required to affect frogs, see <i>ante</i>, <a href="#Page_355">pp. 355</a> and <a href="#Page_356">356</a>.)</p>

<p><b>Birds.</b>&mdash;There is a discrepancy in the descriptions of the action of
aconitine on birds.  L. v. Praag thought the respiration and circulation
but little affected at first; while Achscharumow witnessed in pigeons
dyspn&#339;a, dilatation of the pupils, vomiting, shivering, and paresis. It
may be taken that the usual symptoms observed are some difficulty in
breathing, a diminution of temperature, a loss of muscular power generally
(but not constantly), dilatation of the pupils, and convulsions before death.</p>

<p><b>Mammals.</b>&mdash;The effects vary somewhat, according to the dose. Very
large doses kill rabbits rapidly. They fall on their sides, are violently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
convulsed, and die in an asphyxiated condition; but with smaller doses
the phenomena first observed are generally to be referred to the respiration.
Thus, in an experiment on the horse, Dr. Harley found that the
subcutaneous administration of &middot;6 mgrm. (&middot;01 grain) caused in a weakly
colt some acceleration of the pulse and a partial paralysis of the dilator
narium. Double the quantity given to the same animal some time
after, caused, in six hours and a half, some muscular weakness, and an
evident respiratory trouble. The horse recovered in eighteen hours.
2&middot;7 mgrms. (<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>24</sub> grain) given in the same way, after a long interval of
time, caused, at the end of an hour, more pronounced symptoms; the
pulse, at the commencement 50, rose in an hour and a half to 68, then
the respiration became audible and difficult. In an hour and three-quarters
there were great restlessness and diminution of muscular power.
Two hours after the injection the muscular weakness increased so much
that the horse fell down; he was also convulsed. After eight hours he
began to improve. In another experiment, 32&middot;4 mgrms. (<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> grain) killed
a sturdy entire horse in two hours and twenty minutes, the symptoms
commencing within the hour, and consisting of difficulty of breathing,
irregularity of the heart&#8217;s action, and convulsions.</p>

<p>The general picture of the effects of fatal, but not excessive, doses
given to dogs, cats, rabbits, &amp;c., resembles closely that already described.
The heart&#8217;s action is at first slowed, then becomes quick and irregular,
there is dyspn&#339;a, progressive paralysis of the muscular power, convulsions,
and death in asphyxia. Vomiting is frequently observed, sometimes
salivation, and very often dilatation of the pupil. Sometimes the
latter is abnormally active, dilating and contracting alternately. Diarrh&#339;a
also occurs in a few cases. Vomiting is more frequent when the
poison is taken by the mouth than when administered subcutaneously.<a name="FNanchor_477" id="FNanchor_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a></p>

<p><a name="Sect_432" id="Sect_432"></a>&sect; 432. <b>Statistics.</b>&mdash;During the ten years, 1883-92, there were recorded
in England and Wales, 40 accidental deaths from the various forms of
aconite (19 males, 21 females); and 19 suicidal deaths (9 males, 10
females) from the same cause, which makes a total of 59.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_433" id="Sect_433"></a>&sect; 433. <b>Effects on Man.</b>&mdash;I have collected from European medical
literature, 87 cases of poisoning by aconite in some form or other.
These comprise only 2 cases of murder, 7 of suicide, and 77 which were
more or less accidental. Six of the cases were from the use of the
alkaloid itself; 10 were from the root; in two cases children eat the
flowers; in 1, the leaves of the plant were cooked and eaten by mistake;
in 7, the tincture was mistaken for brandy, sherry, or liqueur; the
remainder were caused by the tincture, the liniment, or the extract.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_434" id="Sect_434"></a>&sect; 434. <b>Poisoning by the Root.</b>&mdash;A case of murder which occurred
some years ago in America, and also the Irish case which took place in
1841 (<i>Reg.</i> v. <i>M&#8217;Conkey</i>), were, until the recent trial of Lamson, the
only instances among English-speaking people of the use of aconite for
criminal purposes; but if we turn to the Indian records, we find that it
has been largely used from the earliest times as a destroyer of human
life. In 1842 a tank of water destined for the use of the British army
in pursuit of the retreating Burmese, was poisoned by intentional contamination
with the bruised root of <i>Aconitum ferox</i>; it was fortunately
discovered before any harm resulted. A preparation of the root is used
in all the hill districts of India to poison arrows for the destruction of
wild beasts. A Lepcha described the root to a British officer as being
&#8220;useful to sportsmen for destroying elephants and tigers, useful to the
rich for putting troublesome relations out of the way, and useful to
jealous husbands for the purpose of destroying faithless wives.&#8221; From
the recorded cases, the powdered root, mixed with food, or the same
substance steeped in spirituous liquor, is usually the part chosen for
administration. In M&#8217;Conkey&#8217;s case, the man&#8217;s wife purchased powdered
aconite root, mixed it with pepper, and strewed it over some greens,
which she cooked and gave to him. The man complained of the sharp
taste of the greens, and soon after the meal vomited, and suffered from
purging, became delirious with lock-jaw, and clenching of the hands;
he died in about three hours. The chief noticeable <i>post-mortem</i> appearance
was a bright red colour of the mucous membrane of the stomach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>The symptoms in this case were, in some respects, different from those
met with in other cases of poisoning by the root. A typical case is given
by Dr. Chevers (<i>op. cit.</i>), in which a man had taken by mistake a small
portion of aconite root. Immediately after chewing it he felt a sweetish
taste, followed immediately by tingling of the lips and tongue, numbness
of the face, and severe vomiting. On admission to hospital he was
extremely restless, tossing his limbs about in all directions and constantly
changing his position. He complained of a burning sensation in the
stomach, and a tingling and numbness in every part of the body,
excepting his legs. The tingling was specially marked in the face and
tongue&mdash;so much so that he was constantly moving the latter to and fro
in order to scratch it against the teeth. Retching and vomiting occurred
almost incessantly, and he constantly placed his hand over the cardiac
region. His face was anxious, the eyes suffused, the lips pale and
exsanguine, the eyelids swollen, moderately dilated, and insensible to
the stimulus of light; the respiration was laboured, 64 in a minute; the
pulse 66, small and feeble. There was inability to walk from loss of
muscular power, but the man was perfectly conscious. The stomach-pump
was used, and albumen and milk administered. Three and three-quarter
hours after taking the root the symptoms were increased in
severity. The tongue was red and swollen, the pulse intermittent, feeble,
and slower. The tingling and numbness had extended to the legs. On
examining the condition of the external sensibility with a pair of scissors,
it was found that, on fully separating the blades and bringing the points
in contact with the skin over the arms and forearms, he felt them as
one, although they were 4 inches apart. But the sensibility of the
thighs and legs was less obtuse, for he could feel the two points distinctly
when they were 4 inches apart, and continued to do so until the distance
between the points fell short of 2<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inches. He began to improve about
the ninth hour, and gradually recovered, although he suffered for one or
two days from a slight diarrh&#339;a. As in the case detailed (<a href="#Page_363">p. 363</a>), no
water was passed for a long time, as if the bladder early lost its power.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_435" id="Sect_435"></a>&sect; 435. <b>Poisoning by the Alkaloid Aconitine.</b>&mdash;Probably the earliest
instance on record is the case related by Dr. Golding Bird in 1848.<a name="FNanchor_478" id="FNanchor_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a>
What kind of aconitine was then in commerce I know not, and since
apparently a person of considerable social rank was the subject of the
poisoning, the case has been imperfectly reported. It seems, however,
that, whether for purposes of suicide, or experiment, or as a medicine,
two grains and a half of aconitine were swallowed. The symptoms were
very violent, consisting of vomiting, collapse, and attacks of muscular
spasm; the narrator describes the vomiting as peculiar. &#8220;It, perhaps,
hardly deserved that title; the patient was seized with a kind of general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
spasm, during which he convulsively turned upon his abdomen, and with
an intense contraction of the abdominal muscles, he jerked out, as it
were, with a loud shout the contents of his stomach, dependent apparently
on the sudden contraction of the diaphragm.&#8221; On attempting to
make him swallow any fluid, a fearful spasm of the throat was produced;
it reminded his medical attendants of hydrophobia. The patient recovered
completely within twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>In the whole seven doses, which were distributed over forty-eight hours,
he took 9&middot;2 mgrms. (&middot;14 grain) of aconitine nitrate.</p>

<p>On taking dose No. 1, he experienced a feeling of constriction
(<i>Zusammenziehung</i>), and burning spreading from the mouth to the
stomach, but this after a little while subsided. Two hours afterwards
he took No. 2, four times the quantity of No. 1. This produced the
same immediate symptoms, but soon he became cold, and felt very ill.
He had an anxious oppressive feeling about the chest, with a burning
feeling about the throat; the whole body was covered with a cold sweat,
his sight failed, he became giddy, there was excessive muscular weakness,
he felt as if he had lost power over his limbs, he had great difficulty in
breathing. During the night he passed no water, nor felt a desire to do
so. About half an hour after he had taken the medicine, he began to
vomit violently, which relieved him much; he then fell asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>Dose No. 3, equal as before to 1&middot;6 mgrm., he took in the morning.
He experienced almost exactly the same symptoms as before, but convulsions
were added, especially of the face; the eyes were also prominent;
twenty minutes after he had taken the dose, vomiting came on, after
which he again felt better.</p>

<p>He took dose No. 4, and had the same repetition of symptoms, but in
the interval between the doses he felt weaker and weaker; he had no
energy, and felt as if paralysed. No. 5 was taken, and produced, like
the others, vomiting, after which he felt relieved. Neither he nor his
wife seemed all this time to have had any suspicion that the medicine
was really doing harm, but thought that the effects were due to its
constant rejection by vomiting, so, in order to prevent vomiting with
No. 6, he drank much cold water. After thus taking the medicine,
the patient seemed to fall into a kind of slumber, with great restlessness;
about an hour and a half afterwards he cried, &#8220;I am chilled; my heart,
my heart is terribly cold. I am dying; I am poisoned.&#8221; His whole
body was covered with perspiration; he was now convulsed, and lost
sight and hearing; his eyes were shut, his lips cracked and dry, he
could scarcely open his mouth, and he was extremely cold, and thought
he was dying. The breathing was difficult and rattling; from time to
time the muscular spasms came on. His wife now made a large quantity
of hot strong black tea, which she got him to drink with great difficulty;
although it was hot, he did not know whether it was hot or cold. About
five minutes afterwards he vomited, and did so several times; this apparently
relieved him, and he sank into a quiet sleep; during the night he
did not urinate. In the morning the wife went to Dr. Carl Meyer,
described the symptoms, and accused the medicine. So convinced was
Dr. Meyer that the medicine did not cause the symptoms, that he poured
out a quantity of the same, equal to 4 mgrms. of aconitine nitrate, and
took it himself in some wine, to show that it was harmless, and ordered
them to go on with it. The unhappy physician died of aconitine poisoning
five hours after taking the medicine.<a name="FNanchor_480" id="FNanchor_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> In the meantime, the woman
went home, and her husband actually took a seventh, but smaller dose,
which produced similar symptoms to the former, but of little severity;
no more was taken.</p>

<p>The absence of diarrh&#339;a, and of the pricking sensations so often

<p><a name="Sect_436" id="Sect_436"></a>&sect; 436. The most important criminal case is undoubtedly that of
Lamson:&mdash;At the Central Criminal Court, in March, 1882, George<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
Henry Lamson, surgeon, was convicted of the murder of his brother-in-law,
Percy Malcolm John. The victim was a weakly youth of
eighteen years of age, paralysed in his lower limbs from old standing
spinal disease. The motive for perpetrating the crime was that Lamson,
through his wife (Malcolm John&#8217;s sister), would receive, on the death of
his brother-in-law, a sum of &pound;1500, and, according to the evidence, it is
probable that there had been one or more previous attempts by Lamson
on the life of the youth with aconitine given in pills and in powders.
However this may be, on November 24, 1880, Lamson purchased 2
grains of aconitine, came down on Dec. 3 to the school where the lad
was placed, had an interview with his brother-in-law, and, in the
presence of the head-master, gave Malcolm John a capsule, which he
filled then and there with some white powder, presumed at the time to
be sugar. Lamson only stayed altogether twenty minutes in the house,
and directly after he saw his brother-in-law swallow the capsule, he left.
Within fifteen minutes Malcolm John became unwell, saying that he
felt as if he had an attack of heart-burn, and then that he felt the
same as when his brother-in-law had on a former occasion given him
a quinine pill. Violent vomiting soon set in, and he complained of pains
in his stomach, a sense of constriction in his throat, and of being unable
to swallow. He was very restless&mdash;so much so that he had to be
restrained by force from injuring himself. There was delirium a few
minutes before death, which took place about three hours and three-quarters
after swallowing the fatal dose. The <i>post-mortem</i> appearances
essentially consisted of redness of the greater curvature of
the stomach, and the posterior portion of the same organ. In one
part there was a little pit, as if a blister had broken; the rest of the
viscera were congested, and the brain also slightly congested.<a name="FNanchor_481" id="FNanchor_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_481" id="Footnote_481"></a><a href="#FNanchor_481"><span class="label">[481]</span></a> To these cases of poisoning by the alkaloid aconitine may be added
one recorded in Bouchardat&#8217;s <i>Annuaire de Th&eacute;rapeutie</i>, 1881, p. 276.
The case in itself is of but little importance, save to illustrate the
great danger in permitting the dispensing of such active remedies of
varying strength. A gentleman suffering from &#8220;angina pectoris&#8221; was
prescribed &#8220;Hottot&#8217;s aconitine&#8221; in granules, and directed carefully to
increase the dose up to four granules, according to the effect produced.
The prescription was taken to a pharmacist, who, instead of supplying
Hottot&#8217;s aconitine, supplied some other of unknown origin. The medicine
was taken daily, and the dose raised to four granules, which were taken
with benefit until the whole was exhausted. He then went to Hottot&#8217;s
establishment, and had a fresh supply, presumably of the same substance,
but a very little time after he had taken his usual dose of four
granules, he suffered from symptoms of aconitine poisoning, headache,
vertigo, feebleness of the voice, and muscular weakness, and was
alarmingly ill. He recovered after some hours of medical treatment.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_437" id="Sect_437"></a>&sect; 437. The symptoms of poisoning by the tincture, extract, or other
preparation, do not differ from those detailed. As unusual effects,
occasionally seen, may be noted profound unconsciousness lasting for two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
hours (Topham&#8217;s case), violent twitching of the muscles of the face,
opisthotonos, and violent convulsions. It is important to distinguish
the symptoms which are not constant from those which are constant, or
nearly so. The tingling and creeping sensations about the tongue,
throat, lips, &amp;c., are not constant; they certainly were not present in the
remarkable German case cited at <a href="#Page_363">p. 363</a>. Speaking generally, they seem
more likely to occur after taking the root or the ordinary medicinal preparations.
A dilated state of the pupil is by no means constant, and
not to be relied upon. Diarrh&#339;a is seen after taking the root or tincture
by the stomach, but is often absent. In short, the only constant symptoms
are difficulty of breathing, progressive muscular weakness, generally
vomiting, and a weak intermittent pulse.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_438" id="Sect_438"></a>&sect; 438. <b>Physiological Action.</b>&mdash;Aconitine, according to Dr. S. Ringer,
is a protoplasmic poison, destroying the functions of all nitrogenous
tissue&mdash;first of the central nervous system, next of the nerves, and last
of the muscles. Aconitine without doubt acts powerfully on the heart,
ultimately paralysing it; there is first a slowing of the pulse, ascribed to
a central excitation of the vagus; then a quickening, due to paralysis of
the peripheral termination of the vagus in the heart; lastly, the heart&#8217;s
action becomes slow, irregular, and weak, and the blood-pressure sinks.
The dyspn&#339;a and convulsions are the usual result, seen among all warm-blooded
animals, of the heart affection. Plugge found that the motor
nerves, and more especially their intra-muscular terminations, were
always paralysed; but if the dose was small the paralysis might be
incomplete. B&#339;hm and Wartmann, on the other hand, considered that
the motor paralysis had a central origin, a view not supported by recent
research. The action of aconitine in this way resembles curare. The
muscles themselves preserve their irritability, even after doses of aconitine
which are five to ten times larger than those by which the nerve
terminations are paralysed.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_439" id="Sect_439"></a>&sect; 439. <b>Post-mortem Appearances.</b>&mdash;Among animals (mammals) the
appearances most constantly observed have been hyper&aelig;mia of the
cerebral membranes and brain, a fulness of the large veins, the blood
generally fluid&mdash;sometimes hyper&aelig;mia of the liver, sometimes not.
When aconitine has been administered subcutaneously, there have been
no inflammatory appearances in the stomach and bowels.</p>

<p>In the case of Dr. Carl Meyer, who died in five hours from swallowing
4 mgrms. of aconitine nitrate, the corpse was of a marble paleness,
the pupils moderately dilated. The colour of the large intestine was
pale; the duodenum was much congested, the congestion being most
intense the nearer to the stomach; the mucous membrane of the stomach
itself was strongly hyper&aelig;mic, being of an intense red colour; the spleen
was enlarged, filled with much dark blood. The liver and kidneys were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
deeply congested, the lungs also congested; the right ventricle of the
heart was distended with blood; in the pericardium there was a quantity
of bloody serum. The brain was generally blood-red; in the cerebral
hemispheres there were several large circumscribed subarachnoid extravasations.
The substance of the brain on section showed many red
bloody points.</p>

<p>In a case recorded by Taylor, in which a man died in three hours
from eating a small quantity of aconitine root, the only morbid
appearance found was a slight reddish-brown patch on the cardiac end
of the stomach, of the size of half a crown; all the other organs being
healthy.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_440" id="Sect_440"></a>&sect; 440. <b>Separation of Aconitine from the Contents of the Stomach
or the Organs.</b>&mdash;It would appear certain that in all operations for the
separation of aconite alkaloids (whether from the organic matters which
make up the plant, or from those constituting animal tissues), mineral
acids and a high heat should be avoided. A 1 per cent. sulphuric acid
does not, however, hydrolyse, if acting in the cold, so that the process
already given, <a href="#Page_352">p. 352</a>, may be followed.</p>

<p>The chemical examination in the Lamson case was entrusted to Dr.
Stevenson, assisted by Dr. Dupr&eacute;, and was conducted on the principles
detailed. The contents of the stomach were treated with alcohol, and
digested at the ordinary temperature of the atmosphere; the contents
were already acid, so no acid in this first operation was added. The mixture
stood for two days and was then filtered. The insoluble portion
was now exhausted by alcohol, faintly acidulated by tartaric acid, and
warmed to 60&deg;; cooled and filtered, the insoluble part being washed again
with alcohol. The two portions&mdash;that is, the spirituous extract acid
from acids pre-existing in the contents of the stomach, and the alcohol
acidified by tartaric acid&mdash;were evaporated down separately, exhausted
by absolute alcohol, the solutions filtered, evaporated, and the residue dissolved
in water. The two aqueous solutions were now mixed, and shaken
up with ether, which, as the solution was acid, would not remove any
alkaloid, but might remove various impurities; the residue, after being
thus partially purified by ether, was alkalised by sodic carbonate, and the
alkaloid extracted by a mixture of chloroform and ether. On evaporation
of the chloroform and ether, the resulting extract was tested
physiologically by tasting, and also by injections into mice. By means
analogous to those detailed, the experts isolated aconitine from the vomit,
the stomach, liver, spleen, and urine, and also a minute quantity of morphine,
which had been administered to the patient to subdue the pain
during his fatal attack. When tasted, the peculiar numbing, tingling
sensation lasted many hours. These extracts were relied upon as evidence,
for their physiological effect was identical with that produced by aconitine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
For example, the extract obtained from the urine caused symptoms
to commence in a mouse in two minutes, and death in thirty
minutes, and the symptoms observed by injecting a mouse with known
aconitine coincided in every particular with the symptoms produced by
the extraction from the urine.</p>

<p>With regard to the manner of using &#8220;<i>life tests</i>,&#8221; since in most cases
extremely small quantities of the active principle will have to be identified,
the choice is limited to small animals, and it is better to use mice or
birds, rather than reptiles. In the Lamson case, subcutaneous injections
were employed, but it is a question whether there is not less error in
administering it by the mouth. If two healthy mice are taken, and the
one fed with a little meal, to which a weighed quantity of the extract
under experiment has been added, while to the other some meal mixed
with a supposed equal dose of aconitine is given, then the symptoms
may be compared; and several objections to any operative proceeding
on such small animals are obviated. It is certain that any extract which
causes distinct numbness of the lips will contain enough of the poison to
kill a small bird or a mouse, if administered in the ordinary way.<a name="FNanchor_482" id="FNanchor_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Atropa belladonna</i> is indigenous, and may be found in some parts
of England, although it cannot be said to be very common. It belongs
to the <i>Solanace&aelig;</i>, and is a herbaceous plant with broadly ovate entire
leaves, and lurid-purple axillary flowers on short stalks; the berries are
violet-black, and the whole of the plant is highly poisonous. The juice
of the leaves stains paper a purple colour. The seeds are very small,
kidney-shaped, weighing about 90 to the grain; they are covered closely
with small, round projections, and are easily identified by an expert, who
may be supposed to have at hand (as is most essential) samples of different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>

<p>Tropine is a white, crystalline, strongly alkaline mass, melting at 60&deg;,
and volatilising at 230&deg; undecomposed. It is soluble in water, alcohol,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
and ether, and gives precipitates with tannic acid, iodised hydriodic
acid, Mayer&#8217;s reagent, gold chloride, and mercuric chloride. Tropine
gold chloride melts at 210&deg; to 212&deg;. Atropic acid (<span class="chemform">C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>2</sub></span>), melting-point
198&deg; to 200&deg;, and isatropic acid (<span class="chemform">C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>2</sub></span>), may also be obtained by
the action of hydrochloric acid&mdash;the first, in radiating crystals, melting
at 106&deg;, and capable of distillation; the second, in thin rhombic plates,
melting about 200&deg;, and not volatile. Picric acid also gives a precipitate
of beautiful plates. To obtain this the carbazotic acid must be in
excess, and time must be given for the precipitate to form.</p>

<p>Atropine forms colourless crystals (mostly in groups or tufts of needles
and prisms), which are heavier than water, and possess no smell, but an
unpleasant, long-enduring, bitter taste. The experiments of E. Schmidt
place the melting-point between 115&deg; and 115&middot;5&deg;. It is said to sublime
scantily in a crystalline form, but the writer has been unable to obtain
any crystals by sublimation; faint mists collect on the upper disc, at
about 123&deg;, but they are perfectly amorphous.</p>

<p>Its reaction is alkaline; one part requires, of cold water, 300; of
boiling, 58; of ether, 30; of benzene, 40; and of chloroform, 3 parts
for solution. In alcohol and amyl alcohol it dissolves in almost every
proportion. It turns the plane of polarisation weakly to the left.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_445" id="Sect_445"></a>&sect; 445. <b>Tests.</b>&mdash;Atropine mixed with nitric acid exhibits no change of
colour. The same is the case with concentrated sulphuric acid in the
cold; but on heating, there ensues the common browning, with development
of a peculiar odour, likened by Gulielmo to orange flowers, by
Dragendorff to the flowers of the <i>Prunus padus</i>, and by Otto to the
<i>Spir&aelig;a ulmaria</i>&mdash;a sufficient evidence of the untrustworthiness of this
as a distinctive test. The odour, indeed, with small quantities, is
certainly not powerful, nor is it strongly suggestive of any of the plants
mentioned. A far more intense odour is given off if a speck of atropine
is evaporated to dryness with a few drops of strong solution of baryta,
and heated strongly; the scent is decidedly analogous to that of hawthorn-blossom,
and unmistakably agreeable.</p>

<p>By boiling a small quantity of atropine, say 1 mgrm., with 2 mgrms.
of calomel and a very little water, the calomel blackens, and crystals may
be obtained of a double salt; this reaction is, however, given also by
hyoscyamine and homatropine. Mercuric potassium iodide solution, and
mercuric bromide solution give amorphous precipitates, which, after a time,
become crystalline, and have characteristic forms.</p>

<p>A solution of iodine in potassium iodide gives a precipitate with acidulated
solutions of atropine in even a dilution of 1&nbsp;: 10,000. Tannin
precipitates, and the precipitate is soluble in excess of the reagent. If
atropine be dissolved in dilute hydrochloric acid, and a 5 per cent. of
gold chloride solution be added, a precipitate of a gold compound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
(<span class="chemform">C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>23</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>HClAuCl<sub>3</sub></span>) separates. The precipitate is in the form of rosettes
or needles; melting-point 137&deg;. On boiling it with water, however, it
melts into oily drops, and this peculiar behaviour distinguishes it from
the analogous salt of hyoscyamine, which does not melt in boiling water.
The percentage of gold left on a combustion of atropine gold chloride is
31&middot;35 per cent. 100 parts of the gold salt are equal to 46&middot;2 of atropine.
A platinum salt may also be obtained, <span class="chemform">(C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>23</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>HCl)<sub>2</sub>,PtCl<sub>4</sub></span>, containing
29&middot;5 per cent. of platinum.</p>

<p>Vitali&#8217;s test is important; it consists in the production of a violet
colour with alcoholic potash after oxidation.</p>

<p>The test may be applied as follows:&mdash;Equal parts, say 1 mgrm., of
nitrate of sodium and of the substance to be tested, are rubbed together
with a glass rod on a porcelain slab, and to this mixture 1 drop of
sulphuric acid is added; the mixture is spread out in a thin film; upon
this is strewn a little powdered potassium hydrate, and finally 1 drop
of alcohol added; a violet colour is produced which passes into a fine
red; according to the author of the test, 0&middot;001 mgrm. of atropine
sulphate can by this test be detected. Strychnine obscures this reaction.</p>

<p>Atropine, homatropine, and hyoscyamine show an alkaline reaction
with phenolphthalein: atropine and homatropine give a precipitate
with <span class="chemform">HgCl<sub>2</sub></span>. Hyoscyamine, not cocaine, precipitates <span class="chemform">HgCl<sub>2</sub></span>, and is
alkaline to litmus, but not to phenolphthalein. Atropine behaves as
follows:&mdash;(1) Sodium nitrate, sulphuric acid, and afterwards sodium
hydroxide, gives a violet colour; (2) the test as before, but with nitrite
instead of nitrate, gives orange colour, which, on dilution with sodium
hydroxide solution, changes to red, violet, or lilac; (3) when heated
with glacial acetic acid and sulphuric acid for a sufficient time, a
greenish-yellow fluorescence is produced.&mdash;<i>Fl&uuml;ckiger, Pharm. Journ.
Trans.</i> (3), vol. xvi. p. 601-602.</p>

<p>The two alkaloids, strychnine and atropine, are not likely to be often
together in the human body, but that it may sometimes occur is shown
by a case recorded by L. Fabris.<a name="FNanchor_488" id="FNanchor_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> A patient in the hospital at Padua
had for some time been treated with daily injections of 3 mgrms. of
strychnine nitrate; unfortunately, one day, instead of the 3 mgrms. of
strychnine, the same quantity of atropine sulphate was injected, and the
patient died after a few hours, with symptoms of atropine poisoning.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>On chemical treatment of the viscera, a mixture of alkaloids was
obtained which did not give either the reactions of strychnine or
of atropine. To test the possibility of these alkaloids obscuring each
other&#8217;s reactions, mixtures of 3 per cent. solutions (the strength of the
injections) of atropine sulphate and strychnine nitrate were mixed together,
and strychnine tested for by the dichromate and sulphuric acid test.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>A mixture of equal parts gave the strychnine reaction very clearly,
but the atropine reaction not at all; 1 strychnine with 3 of atropine
gave strychnine reaction, but not that of atropine; 1 strychnine with
4 atropine gave indistinct reaction for both alkaloids; 1 of strychnine
with 5 of atropine gave a momentary atropine reaction, the violet was,
however, almost immediately replaced by a red colour. Vitali&#8217;s reaction
was not clearly shown until the mixture was in the proportion of 9 of
atropine to 1 of strychnine, but mixtures in the proportion of 3 strychnine
and 1 atropine will give distinct mydriasis.</p>

<p>In such a case, of course, the strychnine should be separated from the
atropine; this can be effected by precipitating the strychnine as chromate,
filtering and recovering from the filter the atropine by alkalising and
shaking it out with ether.</p>

<p>The atropine may be farther purified by converting it into oxalate,
dissolving the oxalate in as small a quantity of alcohol as possible, and
precipitating the oxalate out with ether; the precipitate is collected,
dissolved in as small a quantity of water as possible, the water made
alkaline, and the base shaken out with ether.</p>

<p>The most reliable test for atropine, or one of the mydriatic alkaloids, is
its action on the iris; a solution of atropine, even so weak as 1&nbsp;: 130,000,
causing dilatation.<a name="FNanchor_489" id="FNanchor_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> This action on the iris has been studied by Ruyter,<a name="FNanchor_490" id="FNanchor_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a>
Donders, and von Graefe.</p>

<p>The action is local, taking effect when in dilute solution only on the
eye to which it has been applied; and it has been produced on the eyes
of frogs, not only in the living subject, but after the head has been
severed from the body and deprived of brain. The thinner the cornea,
the quicker the dilatation; therefore, the younger the person or animal,
the more suitable for experiment. In frogs, with a solution of 1&nbsp;: 250,
dilatation commences in about five minutes; in pigeons, seven minutes;
and in rabbits, ten minutes. In man, a solution of 1&nbsp;: 120 commences
to act in about six to seven minutes, reaches its highest point in from ten
to fifteen minutes, and persists more or less for six to eight days. A
solution of 1&nbsp;: 480 acts first in fifteen to twenty minutes, and reaches its
greatest point in twenty minutes; a solution of 1&nbsp;: 48,000 requires from
three-quarters of an hour to an hour to show its effect. Dogs and cats
are far more sensible to its influence than man, and therefore more suitable
for experiment. If the expert chooses, he may essay the proof
upon himself, controlling the dilatation by Calabar bean; but it is seldom
necessary or advisable to make personal trials of this nature.<a name="FNanchor_491" id="FNanchor_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a></p>

<p><a name="Sect_446" id="Sect_446"></a>&sect; 446. <b>Statistics of Atropine Poisoning.</b>&mdash;Since atropine is the active
principle of belladonna and datura plants, and every portion of these&mdash;root,
seeds, leaves, and fruit&mdash;has caused toxic symptoms, poisoning by
any part of these plants, or by their pharmaceutical or other preparations,
may be considered with strict propriety as atropine poisoning. Our
English death statistics for the ten years ending 1892, record 79 deaths
(50 males and 29 females) from atropine (for the most part registered
under the head of belladonna); 29 (or 36&middot;7 per cent.) were suicidal, the
rest accidental.</p>

<p>The greatest number of the accidental cases arise from mistakes in
pharmacy; thus, belladonna leaves have been supplied for ash leaves;
the extract of belladonna has been given instead of extract of juniper;
the alkaloid itself has been dispensed in mistake for theine;<a name="FNanchor_492" id="FNanchor_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> a more
curious and marvellously stupid mistake is one in which it was dispensed
instead of assaf&#339;tida (Schauenstein, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 652). Further, valerianate
of atropine has been accidentally substituted for quinine valerianate,
and Schauenstein relates a case in which atropine sulphate was administered
subcutaneously instead of morphine sulphate; but the result was
not lethal. Many other instances might be cited. The extended use of
atropine as an external application to the eye naturally gives rise to a few
direct and indirect accidents. Serious symptoms have arisen from the
solution reaching the pharynx through the lachrymal duct and nose.
A curious indirect poisoning, caused by the use of atropine as a collyrium,
is related by Schauenstein.<a name="FNanchor_493" id="FNanchor_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> A person suffered from all the
symptoms of atropine poisoning; but the channel by which it had
obtained access to the system was a great mystery, until it was traced
to some coffee, and it was then found that the cook had strained this
coffee through a certain piece of linen, which had been used months
before, soaked in atropine solution, as a collyrium, and had been cast
aside as of no value.</p>

applications of atropine are rapidly absorbed, <i>e.g.</i>, if the foot of a rat be
steeped for a little while in a solution of the alkaloid, and the eyes
watched, dilatation of the pupils will soon be observed. If the skin is
broken, enough may be absorbed to cause death. A case is on record in
which &middot;21 grm. of atropine sulphate, applied as an ointment to the abraded
skin, was fatal.<a name="FNanchor_494" id="FNanchor_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> Atropine has also been absorbed from the bowel; in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
one case, a clyster containing the active principles of 5&middot;2 grms. (80 grains)
of belladonna root was administered to a woman twenty-seven years of
age, and caused death. Allowing the root to have been carefully dried,
and to contain &middot;21 per cent. of alkaloid, it would seem that so little as
10&middot;9 mgrms. (&middot;16 grain) may even prove fatal, if left in contact with the
intestinal mucous membrane. Belladonna berries and stramonium leaves
and seeds are eaten occasionally by children. A remarkable series of
poisonings by belladonna berries occurred in London during the autumn
of 1846.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>Criminal poisoning by atropine in any form is of excessive rarity in
Europe and America, but in India it has been frightfully prevalent. In
all the Asiatic cases the substance used has been one of the various species
of datura, and mostly the bruised or ground seeds, or a decoction of the
seeds. In 120 cases recorded in papers and works on Indian toxicology,
I find no less than 63 per cent. of the cases criminal, 19 per cent. suicidal,
and 18 per cent. accidental. In noting these figures, however, it must
be borne in mind that known criminal cases are more certain to be recorded
than any other cases. The drug has been known under the Sanscrit
name of <i>dhatoora</i> by the Hindoos from most remote times. It was largely
used by the Thugs, either for the purpose of stupefying their victim or
for killing him; by loose wives to ensure for a time the fatuity of their
husbands; and, lastly, it seems in Indian history to have played the
peculiar <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of a state agent, and to have been used to induce the idiocy
or insanity of persons of high rank, whose mental integrity was considered
dangerous by the despot in power. The Hindoos, by centuries
of practice, have attained such dexterity in the use of the &#8220;datura&#8221; as
to raise that kind of poisoning to an art, so that Dr. Chevers, in his
<i>Medical Jurisprudence for India</i>,<a name="FNanchor_495" id="FNanchor_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> declares that &#8220;there appears to be
no drug known in the present day which represents in its effects so close an
approach to the system of slow poisoning, believed by many to have
been practised in the Middle Ages, as does the datura.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="Sect_448" id="Sect_448"></a>&sect; 448. <b>Fatal Dose.</b>&mdash;It is impossible to state with precision the exact
quantity which may cause death, atropine being one of those substances
whose effect, varying in different cases, seems to depend on special constitutional
tendencies or idiosyncracies of the individual. Some persons
take a comparatively large amount with impunity, while others scarcely
bear a very moderate dose without exhibiting unpleasant symptoms.
Eight mgrms. (<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> grain) have been known to produce poisonous symptoms,
and &middot;129 grm. (2 grains) death. We may, therefore, infer that about
&middot;0648 grm. (1 grain) would, unchecked by remedies, probably act fatally;
but very large doses have been recovered from, especially when treatment
has been prompt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>Atropine is used in veterinary practice, from 32&middot;4 to 64&middot;8 mgrms.
(<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 grain) and more being administered subcutaneously to horses;
but the extent to which this may be done with safety is not yet established.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_449" id="Sect_449"></a>&sect; 449. <b>Action on Animals.</b>&mdash;The action of atropine has been studied
on certain beetles, on reptiles (such as the salamander, triton, frogs, and
others), on guinea-pigs, hedgehogs, rats, rabbits, fowls, pigeons, dogs, and
cats. Among the mammalia there is no essential difference in the symptoms,
but great variation in the relative sensibility; man seems the most
sensitive of all, next to man come the carnivora, while the herbivora, and
especially the rodents, offer a considerable resistance. According to Falck
the lethal dose for a rabbit is at least &middot;79 mgrm. per kilo. It is the
general opinion that rabbits may eat sufficient of the belladonna plant to
render their flesh poisonous, and yet the animals themselves may show
no disturbance in health; but this must not be considered adequately
established. Speaking very generally, the higher the animal organisation
the greater the sensibility to atropine. Frogs are affected in a peculiar
manner. According to the researches of Fraser,<a name="FNanchor_496" id="FNanchor_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> the animal is first paralysed,
and some hours after the administration of the poison lies motionless,
the only signs of life being the existence of a slight movement of
the heart and muscular irritability. After a period of from forty-eight to
seventy-two hours, the fore limbs are seized with tetanic spasms, which
develop into a strychnine-like tetanus.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_450" id="Sect_450"></a>&sect; 450. <b>Action on Man.</b>&mdash;When atropine is injected subcutaneously,
the symptoms, as is usually the case with drugs administered in this
manner, may come on immediately, the pupil not unfrequently dilating
almost before the injection is finished. This is in no way surprising;
but there are instances in which decoctions of datura seeds have been
administered by the stomach, and the commencement of symptoms has
been as rapid as in poisoning by oxalic or even prussic acid. In a case
tried in India in July 1852, the prosecutor declared that, while a person
was handing him a <i>lota</i> of water, the prisoner snatched it away on pretence
of freeing the water from dirt or straws, and then gave it to him.
He then drank only two mouthfuls, and, complaining of the bitter taste,
fell down insensible within forty yards of the spot where he had drunk,
and did not recover his senses until the third day after. In another case,
a man was struck down so suddenly that his feet were scalded by some
hot water which he was carrying.&mdash;<i>Chevers.</i></p>

<p>When the seeds, leaves, or fruit of atropine-holding plants are eaten,
there is, however, a very appreciable period before the symptoms commence,
and, as in the case of opium poisoning, no very definite rule can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
be laid down, but usually the effects are experienced within half an hour.
The first sensation is dryness of the mouth and throat; this continues
increasing, and may rise to such a degree that the swallowing of liquids
is an impossibility. The difficulty in swallowing does not seem to be
entirely dependent on the dry state of the throat, but is also due to a
spasmodic contraction of the pharyngeal muscles. Tissore<a name="FNanchor_497" id="FNanchor_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> found in
one case such constriction that he could only introduce emetics by passing
a catheter of small diameter. The mucous membrane is reddened,
and the voice hoarse.<a name="FNanchor_498" id="FNanchor_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> The inability to swallow, and the changed voice,
bear some little resemblance to hydrophobia&mdash;a resemblance heightened to
the popular mind by an inclination to bite, which seems to have been occasionally
observed; the pupils are early dilated, and the dilatation may be
marked and extreme; the vision is deranged, letters and figures often
appear duplicated; the eyeballs are occasionally remarkably prominent,
and generally congested; the skin is dry, even very small quantities of
atropine arresting the cutaneous secretion; in this respect atropine and
pilocarpine are perfect examples of antagonism. With the dryness of
skin, in a large percentage of cases, occurs a scarlet rash over most of the
body. This is generally the case after large doses, but Stadler saw the
rash produced on a child three months old by &middot;3 mgrm. of atropine
sulphate. It appeared three minutes after the dose, lasted five hours,
and was reproduced by a renewed dose.<a name="FNanchor_499" id="FNanchor_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> The temperature of the body
with large doses is raised; with small, somewhat lowered. The pulse is
increased in frequency, and is always above 100&mdash;mostly from 115 to
120, or even 150, in the minute. The breathing is at first a little slowed,
and then very rapid. Vomiting is not common; the sphincters may be
paralysed so that the evacuations are involuntary, and there may be also
spasmodic contractions of the urinary bladder. The nervous system is
profoundly affected; in one case there were clonic spasms,<a name="FNanchor_500" id="FNanchor_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> in another,<a name="FNanchor_501" id="FNanchor_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a>
such muscular rigidity, that the patient could with difficulty be placed
on a chair. The lower extremities are often partly paralysed, there is a
want of co-ordination, the person reels like a drunken man, or there may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
be general jactitation. The disturbance of the brain functions is very
marked; in about 4 per cent. only of the recorded cases has there been
no delirium, or very little&mdash;in the majority delirium is present. In
adults this generally takes a garrulous, pleasing form, but every variety
has been witnessed. Dr. H. Giraud describes the delirium from datura
(which it may be necessary to again repeat is <i>atropine</i> delirium) as
follows:&mdash;&#8220;He either vociferates loudly or is garrulous, and talks incoherently;
sometimes he is mirthful, and laughs wildly, or is sad and
moans, as if in great distress; generally he is observed to be very timid,
and, when most troublesome and unruly, can always be cowed by an
angry word, frequently putting up his hands in a supplicating posture.
When approached he suddenly shrinks back as if apprehensive of being
struck, and frequently he moves about as if to avoid spectra. But the
most invariable accompaniment of the final stage of delirium, and
frequently also that of <i>sopor</i>, is in the incessant picking at real or
imaginary objects. At one time the patient seizes hold of parts of his
clothes or bedding, pulls at his fingers and toes, takes up dirt and stones
from the ground, or as often snatches at imaginary objects in the air, on
his body, or anything near him. Very frequently he appears as if
amusing himself by drawing out imaginary threads from the ends of his
fingers, and occasionally his antics are so varied and ridiculous, that I
have seen his near relatives, although apprehensive of danger, unable to
restrain their laughter.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_502" id="FNanchor_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> This active delirium passes into a somnolent
state with muttering, catching at the bedclothes, or at floating spectra,
and in fatal cases the patient dies in this stage. As a rule, the sleep is
not like opium coma; there is complete insensibility in both, but in the
one the sleep is deep, without muttering, in the other, from atropine, it
is more like the stupor of a fever. The course in fatal cases is rapid,
death generally taking place within six hours. If a person live over seven
or eight hours, he usually recovers, however serious the symptoms may
appear. On waking, the patient remembers nothing of his illness;
mydriasis remains some time, and there may be abnormality of speech
and weakness of the limbs, but within four days health is re-established.
In cases where the seeds have been swallowed, the symptoms may be
much prolonged, and they seem to continue until all the seeds have been
voided&mdash;perhaps this is due to the imperfect but continuous extraction of
atropine by the intestinal juices.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>Chronic poisoning by atropine may, from what has been stated, be of
great importance in India. It is probable that its continuous effect would
tend to weaken the intellect, and there is no reason for any incredulity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
with regard to its power as a factor of insanity. Rossbach has ascertained
that if dogs are, day after day, dosed with atropine, they become
emaciated; but a certain tolerance is established, and the dose has to be
raised considerably after a time to produce any marked physiological
effect.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_451" id="Sect_451"></a>&sect; 451. <b>Physiological Action of Atropine.</b>&mdash;From the numerous
experiments on animals which have been performed for the purpose of
elucidating the action of atropine, it is clear that the terminations of the
vagus in the heart muscle are first excited, and then paralysed. The
excitor-motor ganglion is also paralysed, and finally the heart itself;
death resulting from heart paralysis. The respiratory disturbance is
also to be ascribed to the vagus; the terminations in the lung are
paralysed, and, at the same time, the poison circulating through the
respiratory nervous centre stimulates it first, and then it also becomes
finally paralysed. The small vessels are generally widened after a previous
transitory narrowing. Organs containing unstriped muscular fibre are
generally paralysed, as well as the ends of the nerves regulating secretion&mdash;hence
the dryness of the skin. The action on the iris is not thoroughly
elucidated.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_452" id="Sect_452"></a>&sect; 452. The <i>diagnosis</i> of atropine poisoning may be very difficult unless
the attention of the medical man be excited by some suspicious circumstance.
A child suffering from belladonna rash, with hot dry skin, quick
pulse, and reddened fauces, looks not unlike one under an attack of
scarlet fever. Further, as before mentioned, some cases are similar to
rabies; and again, the garrulous delirium and the hallucinations of an
adult are often very similar to those of <i>delirium tremens</i>, as well as tomania.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_453" id="Sect_453"></a>&sect; 453. <b>Post-mortem Appearances.</b>&mdash;The <i>post-mortem</i> appearances do not
seem to be characteristic, save in the fact that the pupils remain
dilated. The brain is usually hyper&aelig;mic, and in one case the absence of
moisture seems to have been remarkable. The stomach and intestines may
be somewhat irritated if the seeds, leaves, or other parts of the plant have
been eaten; but the irritation is not constant if the poisoning has been
by pure atropine, and still less is it likely to be present if atropine has
been administered subcutaneously.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_454" id="Sect_454"></a>&sect; 454. <b>Treatment.</b>&mdash;The great majority of cases recover under treatment.
In 112 cases collected by F. A. Falck, 13 only were fatal (11&middot;6
per cent.). The greater portion of the deaths in India are those of
children and old people&mdash;persons of feeble vitality. The Asiatic treatment,
which has been handed down by tradition, is the application of
cold water to the feet; but the method which has found most favour in
England is treatment by pilocarpine, a fifth of a grain or more being
injected from time to time. Pilocarpine shows as perfect antagonism as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
possible; atropine dries, pilocarpine moistens the skin; atropine accelerates,
pilocarpine slows the respiration. Dr. Sydney Ringer and others
have published a remarkable series of cases showing the efficacy of this
treatment, which, of course, is to be combined where necessary with
emetics, the use of the stomach-pump, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_503" id="FNanchor_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a></p>

<p><a name="Sect_455" id="Sect_455"></a>&sect; 455. <b>Separation of Atropine from Organic Tissues, &amp;c.</b>&mdash;From
the contents of the stomach, atropine may be separated by acidulating
strongly with sulphuric acid (15 to 20 c.c. of dilute <span class="chemform">H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub></span> to 100 c.c.),
digesting for some time at a temperature not exceeding 70&deg;, and then
reducing any solid matter to a pulp by friction, and filtering, which can
generally be effected by the aid of a filter-pump. The liver, muscles,<a name="FNanchor_504" id="FNanchor_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a>
and coagulated blood, &amp;c., may also be treated in a precisely similar way.
The acid liquid thus obtained, is first, to remove impurities, shaken up
with amyl alcohol, and after the separation of the latter in the usual
manner, it is agitated with chloroform, which will take up any of the
remaining amyl alcohol,<a name="FNanchor_505" id="FNanchor_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> and also serve to purify further. The chloroform
is then removed by a pipette (or the separating flask before
described), and the fluid made alkaline, and shaken up with ether, which,
on removal, is allowed to evaporate spontaneously. The residue will
contain atropine, and this may be farther purified by converting it into
oxalate, as suggested, <a href="#Page_374">page 374</a>.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_504" id="Footnote_504"></a><a href="#FNanchor_504"><span class="label">[504]</span></a> Neither amyl alcohol nor chloroform removes atropine from an
<i>acid</i> solution.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_505" id="Footnote_505"></a><a href="#FNanchor_505"><span class="label">[505]</span></a> Atropine goes into the blood, and appears to be present in the
different organs in direct proportion to the quantity of blood they
contain. Dragendorff has found in the muscles of rabbits fed upon
belladonna sufficient atropine for quantitative estimation.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>From the urine,<a name="FNanchor_506" id="FNanchor_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> atropine may be extracted by acidifying with
sulphuric acid, and agitation with the same series of solvents. Atropine
has been separated from putrid matters long after death, nor does it
appear to suffer any decomposition by the ordinary analytical operations of
evaporating solutions to dryness at 100&deg;. In other words, there seems to
be no necessity for operations <i>in vacuo</i>, in attempts at separating atropine.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_506" id="Footnote_506"></a><a href="#FNanchor_506"><span class="label">[506]</span></a> Dragendorff has found atropine in the urine of rabbits fed with

<h5>2. HYOSCYAMINE.</h5>

<p><a name="Sect_456" id="Sect_456"></a>&sect; 456. This powerful alkaloid is contained in small quantities in
datura and belladonna, and also is found in the common lettuce (&middot;001
per cent.),<a name="FNanchor_507" id="FNanchor_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> and in <i>Scopola carmolica</i>, a solanaceous plant indigenous
to Austria and Hungary<a name="FNanchor_508" id="FNanchor_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a>; but its chief source is the <i>Hyoscyamus niger</i>
and <i>Hyoscyamus alba</i> (black and white henbane): it is also found in
the <i>Duboisia myoporoides</i>. The latter plant was considered to contain a
new alkaloid, &#8220;<i>Duboisine</i>,&#8221; but duboisine is a mixture of hyoscyamine
and hyoscine. Ladenburg&#8217;s hyoscine accompanies hyoscyamine, and is
an isomeride of both atropine and hyoscyamine; its chemical reactions are
similar to those of hyoscyamine, as well as its physiological effects.<a name="FNanchor_509" id="FNanchor_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a></p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p><b>Hyoscyamine</b> (<span class="chemform">C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>23</sub>NO<sub>3</sub></span>), as separated in the course of analysis, is
a resinoid, sticky, amorphous mass, difficult to dry, and possessing a
tobacco-like odour. It can, however, be obtained in well-marked odourless
crystals, which melt at 108&deg;-109&deg;, a portion subliming unchanged.
It liquefies under boiling water without crystallisation. According to
Thorey,<a name="FNanchor_510" id="FNanchor_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> hyoscyamine crystallises out of chloroform in rhombic tables,
and out of benzene in fine needles; but out of ether or amyl alcohol it
remains amorphous. When perfectly pure, it dissolves with difficulty in
cold, but more readily in hot, water; if impure, it is hygroscopic, and its
solubility is much increased. In any case, it dissolves easily in alcohol,
ether, chloroform, amyl alcohol, benzene, and dilute acids. Hyoscyamine
neutralises acids fully, and forms crystallisable salts, which assume for
the most part the form of needles. It is isomeric with atropine, and is
converted into atropine by heating to 110&deg;, or warming with alcoholic
potash. The gold salt melts at 159&deg;, and does not melt in boiling water
like the atropine gold salt.</p>

and the root, or the flowers, may be met with occasionally, especially
among herbalists. The table<a name="FNanchor_511" id="FNanchor_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> (<a href="#Page_382">p. 382</a>) will give an idea of the alkaloidal
content of the different parts of the plant.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_511" id="Footnote_511"></a><a href="#FNanchor_511"><span class="label">[511]</span></a> This table, taken from Dragendorff&#8217;s <i>Chemische Werthbestimmung
einiger starkwirkenden Droguen</i>, embodies the researches of Thorey.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>In order to ascertain the percentage of the alkaloid in any part of the
plant, the process followed by Thorey has the merit of simplicity. The
substance is first exhausted by petroleum ether, which frees it from fat;
after drying, it is extracted with 85 per cent. alcohol at a temperature
not exceeding 40&deg;. The alcoholic extracts are then united, the alcohol
distilled off, and the residue filtered. The filtrate is now first purified
by agitation with petroleum ether, then saturated by ammonia, and
shaken up with chloroform. The latter, on evaporation, leaves the
alkaloid only slightly impure, and, after washing with distilled water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
if dissolved in dilute sulphuric acid, a crystalline sulphate may be readily
obtained.</p>

<p><b>A tincture and an extract of henbane leaves and flowering tops</b>
are officinal in most pharmacop&#339;ias; an extract of the seeds in that of
France.</p>

<p><b>An oil of hyoscyamus</b> is officinal in all the Continental pharmacop&#339;ias,
but not in the British.</p>

<p><b>Henbane juice</b> is recognised by the British pharmacop&#339;ia; it is about
the same strength as the tincture.</p>

<p><b>An ointment</b>, made of one part of the extract to nine of simple
ointment, is officinal in the German pharmacop&#339;ia.</p>

<p>The tincture (after distilling off the spirit) and the extracts (on proper
solution) may be conveniently titrated by Mayer&#8217;s reagent (<a href="#Page_263">p. 263</a>), which,
for this purpose, should be diluted one-half; each c.c. then, according to
Dragendorff, equalling 6&middot;98 mgrms. of hyoscyamine. Kruse found 0&middot;042
per cent. of hyoscyamine in a Russian tincture, and &middot;28 per cent. in a Russian
extract. Any preparation made with extract of henbane will be found
to contain nitrate of potash, for Attfield has shown the extract to be
rich in this substance. The ointment will require extraction of the fat
by petroleum ether; this accomplished, the determination of its strength
is easy.</p>

<p><b>The oil of hyoscyamus</b> is poisonous, and contains the alkaloid. An
exact quantitative research is difficult; but if 20 grms. of the oil are
shaken up for some time with water acidified by sulphuric acid, the
fluid separated from the oil, made alkaline, shaken up with chloroform,
and the latter removed and evaporated, sufficient will be obtained to test
successfully for the presence of the alkaloid, by its action on the pupil of
the eye.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_458" id="Sect_458"></a>&sect; 458. <b>Dose and Effects.</b>&mdash;The dose of the uncrystalline hyoscyamine
is 6 mgrms. (<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub> grain), carefully increased. I have seen it extensively
used in asylums to calm violent or troublesome maniacs. Thirty-two
mgrms. (<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> grain) begin to act within a quarter of an hour; the face
flushes, the pupils dilate, there is no excitement, all muscular motion
is enfeebled, and the patient remains quiet for many hours, the effects
from a single dose not uncommonly lasting two days. 64&middot;8 mgrms.
(1 grain) would be a very large, and possibly fatal, dose. The absence
of delirium or excitement, with full doses of hyoscyamine, is a striking
contrast to the action of atropine, in every other respect so closely
allied; yet there are cases on record showing that the henbane root
itself has an action similar to that of belladonna, unless indeed one root
has been mistaken for another; <i>e.g.</i>, Sonnenschein relates the following
ancient case of poisoning:&mdash;In a certain cloister the monks ate by error
the root of henbane. In the night they were all taken with hallucinations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
so that the pious convent was like a madhouse. One monk sounded
at midnight the matins, some who thereupon came into chapel could not
read, others read what was not in the book, others sang drinking songs&mdash;in
short, there was the greatest disturbance.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_459" id="Sect_459"></a>&sect; 459. <b>Separation of Hyoscyamine from Organic Matters.</b>&mdash;The
isolation of the alkaloid from organic tissues or fluids, in cases where a
medicinal preparation of henbane, or of the leaves, root, &amp;c., has been
taken, is possible, and should be carried out on the principles already
detailed. Hyoscyamine is mainly identified by its power of dilating the
pupil of the eye. It is said that so small a quantity as &middot;0083 mgrm.
(<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4000</sub> grain) will in fifteen minutes dilate the eye of a rabbit. It is true
that atropine also dilates the pupil; but if sufficient of the substance
should have been isolated to apply other tests, it can be distinguished
from atropine by the fact that the latter gives no immediate precipitate
with platinic chloride, whilst hyoscyamine is precipitated by a small
quantity of platinic chloride, and dissolved by a larger amount, and also
by the characters of the gold salt.</p>

it does not blacken calomel. It is very poisonous.</p>

<h5>4. SOLANINE.</h5>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><a name="Sect_461" id="Sect_461"></a>&sect; 461. <b>Distribution of Solanine.</b>&mdash;Solanine is a poisonous nitrogenised glucoside
found in all parts of the plants belonging to the nightshade order. The English
common plants in which solanine occurs are the edible potato plant (<i>Solanum
tuberosum</i>), the nightshade (<i>Solanum nigrum</i>), and the <i>Solanum dulcamara</i>, or
bitter-sweet. The berries of the <i>Solanum nigrum</i> and those of <i>S. dulcamara</i>
contain about 0&middot;3 per cent. Mature healthy potatoes appear to contain no solanine,
but from 150 grms. of diseased potatoes G. Kassner<a name="FNanchor_515" id="FNanchor_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> separated 30 to 50 mgrms.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_462" id="Sect_462"></a>&sect; 462. <b>Properties of Solanine.</b>&mdash;The reaction of the crystals is weakly alkaline;
the taste is somewhat bitter and pungent. Solanine is soluble in 8000 parts of
boiling water, 4000 parts of ether, 500 parts of cold, and 125 of boiling alcohol.
It dissolves well in hot amyl alcohol, but is scarcely soluble in benzene. An
aqueous solution froths on shaking, but not to the degree possessed by saponine
solutions.</p>

<p>The amyl alcohol solution has the property of gelatinising when cold. It does
this if even so little as 1 part of solanine is dissolved in 2000 of hot amyl alcohol.
The jelly is so firm that the vessel may be inverted without any loss. This
peculiar property is one of the most important tests for the presence of solanine.
The hot ethylic alcohol solution will, on cooling, also gelatinise, but a stronger solution
is required. From very dilute alcoholic solutions (and especially with slow cooling)
solanine may be obtained in crystals. In dilute mineral acids solanine dissolves
freely, and forms salts, which for the most part have an acid reaction and are soluble
in alcohol and in water, but with difficulty in ether. The compounds with the
acids are not very stable, and several of them are broken up on warming the solution,
solanine separating out from the aqueous solutions of the solanine salts. The
alkaloid may be precipitated by the fixed and volatile alkalies, and by the alkaline
earths. Solanine will stand boiling with strongly alkaline solutions without decomposition;
but dilute acids, on warming, hydrolyse. By heating solanine in alcoholic
solution with ethyl iodide in closed tubes, and then treating the liquid with ammonia,
ethyl solanine in well-formed crystals can be obtained. Solanine is precipitated by
phosphomolybdic acid, but by very few other substances. It gives, for example, no
precipitate with the following reagents:&mdash;Platinic chloride, gold chloride, mercuric
chloride, potassic bichromate, and picric acid. Tannin precipitates it only after a
time. Sodic phosphate gives a crystalline precipitate of solanine phosphate, if
added to a solution of solanine sulphate. Both solanine and solanidine give with
nitric acid at first a colourless solution, which, on gentle warming, passes into blue,
then into light red, and lastly becomes weakly yellow. Solanine, dissolved in strong
sulphuric acid, to which a little Fr&ouml;hde&#8217;s reagent is added, at first colours the fluid
light brown; after standing some time the edges of the drop becomes reddish-yellow,
and finally the whole a beautiful cherry-red, which gradually passes into dark violet
when violet-coloured flocks separate.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_463" id="Sect_463"></a>&sect; 463. <b>Solanidine.</b>&mdash;Solanidine has stronger basic properties than solanine. Its
formula is <span class="chemform">C<sub>40</sub>H<sub>61</sub>NO<sub>2</sub></span>. It is obtained from an alcoholic solution in amorphous
masses interspersed with needles; m.p. 191&deg;. It dissolves readily in hot alcohol,
with difficulty in ether. With hydrochloric acid it forms a hydrochloride&mdash;<span class="chemform">3(C<sub>40</sub>H<sub>61</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>HCl)HCl</span>
+ <span class="chemform">H<sub>2</sub>O</span> or <span class="chemform">1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</span>. This hydrochloride is a slightly yellow powder,
only sparingly soluble in water, and carbonising without melting when heated
to 287&deg;. Solanidine also forms a sulphate, <span class="chemform">3(C<sub>40</sub>H<sub>61</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>)H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub></span> + <span class="chemform">8H<sub>2</sub>O</span>; this salt
is in the form of scaly plates, melting at 247&deg;; it dissolves readily in water.</p>

<p>The sugar obtained from the hydrolysis of solanidine is a yellow amorphous mass
dissolving readily in water and wood spirit, and has a specific rotatory power of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387"><span class="fsize110">[387]</span></a></span>
[&#945;]<sub>D</sub> = + 28&middot;623. With Phenylhydrazine hydrochloride and sodium acetate in
aqueous solution it forms a glucosazone, melting at 199&deg;. It is probably a mixture
of sugars.</p>

<p>Solaneine is the name that has been given to the amorphous substance accompanying
solanine; on hydrolysis it yields solanidine and the same sugar as solanine.
Its formula is <span class="chemform">C<sub>52</sub>H<sub>82</sub>NO<sub>13</sub></span> with <span class="chemform">4H<sub>2</sub>O</span>.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_464" id="Sect_464"></a>&sect; 464. <b>Poisoning from Solanine.</b>&mdash;Poisoning from solanine has been, in all
recorded cases, induced, not by the pure alkaloid (which is scarcely met with out of
the laboratory of the scientific chemist), but by the berries of the different species of
<i>Solanum</i>, and has for the most part been confined to children. The symptoms in
about twenty cases,<a name="FNanchor_517" id="FNanchor_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> which may be found detailed in the medical literature of this
century, have varied so greatly that the most opposite phenomena have been witnessed
as effects of poisoning by the same substance. The most constant phenomena
are a quick pulse, laboured respiration, great restlessness, and hyper&aelig;sthesia
of the skin. Albumen in the urine is common. Nervous symptoms, such as
convulsions, aphasia, delirium, and even catalepsy, have been witnessed. In some
cases there have been the symptoms of an irritant poison&mdash;diarrh&#339;a, vomiting,
and pain in the bowels: in many cases dilatation of the pupil has been observed.</p>

<p>Rabbits are killed by doses of &middot;1 grm. per kilo. The symptoms commence in
about ten minutes after the administration, and consist of apathy and a low temperature;
the breathing is much slowed. Convulsions set in suddenly before death,
and the pupils become dilated. The <i>post-mortem</i> appearances in animals are intense
redness and injection of the meninges of the cerebellum, of the medulla oblongata,
and the spinal cord. Dark red blood is found in the heart, and the kidneys are
hyper&aelig;mic. The intestinal mucous membrane is normal.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_465" id="Sect_465"></a>&sect; 465. <b>Separation of Solanine from the Tissues of the Body.</b>&mdash;Dragendorff has
proved the possibility of separating solanine from animal tissues by extracting it from
a poisoned pig. The best plan seems to be to extract with cold dilute sulphuric acid
water, which is then made alkaline by ammonia, and shaken up with warm amyl
alcohol. This readily dissolves any solanine. The peculiar property possessed by
the alkaloid of gelatinising, and the play of colours with Fr&ouml;hde&#8217;s reagent, may then
be essayed on the solanine thus separated.</p>

<h5>5. CYTISINE.</h5>

<p><a name="Sect_466" id="Sect_466"></a>&sect; 466. <b>The Cytisus Laburnum.</b>&mdash;The laburnum tree, <i>Cytisus laburnum</i>,
so common in shrubberies, is intensely poisonous. The flowers, bark,
wood, seeds, and the root have all caused serious symptoms. The active
principle is an alkaloid, to which the name of Cytisine has been given.
The best source is the seeds. The seeds are powdered and extracted with
alcohol containing hydrochloric acid, the alcohol distilled off, the residue
treated with water and filtered through a wet filter to remove any fatty
oil, the filtrate treated with lead acetate; and, after separating the precipitated
colouring matter, made alkaline with caustic potash, and shaken
with amyl alcohol. The amyl alcohol is shaken with dilute hydrochloric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
acid, the solution evaporated, the crude crystals of hydrochloride thus
obtained treated with alcohol to remove colouring matters, and recrystallised
several times from water; it then forms well-developed, colourless,
transparent prisms. From the hydrochloride the free base is readily
obtained.</p>

<p><b>Cytisine</b>, <span class="chemform">C<sub>11</sub>H<sub>14</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O</span>.&mdash;To cytisine used to be ascribed the formula
<span class="chemform">C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>27</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O</span>, but a study of the salt and new determinations appear to
prove that it is identical with ulexine.<a name="FNanchor_518" id="FNanchor_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> Cytisine is in the form of white
radiating crystals, consisting, when deposited from absolute alcohol, of
anhydrous prisms, which melt at from 152&deg; to 153&deg;. Cytisine has a strong

in benzene and amyl alcohol, almost insoluble in cold light petroleum,
and insoluble in pure ether. The specific rotatory power in solution is

<p>It is capable of sublimation in a current of hydrogen at 154&middot;5&deg;; the
sublimate is in the form of very long needles and small leaflets; at
higher temperatures it melts to a yellow oily fluid, again becoming
crystalline on cooling. Cytisine is a strong base; it precipitates the
earths and oxides of the heavy metals from solutions of the chlorides,
and, even in the cold, expels ammonia from its combinations.</p>

<p>Cytisine forms numerous crystalline salts, among which may be

cytisine without colour; if to the solution is added a drop of nitric acid,
it becomes orange-yellow, and on addition of a crystal of potassic bichromate,
first yellow, then dirty brown, and lastly green. Concentrated
nitric acid dissolves the base in the cold without colour, but, on warming,
it becomes orange-yellow. Picric, tannic, and phosphomolybdic acids,
potassic, mercuric, and potass. cadmium iodides, and iodine with potassic
iodide, all give precipitates. Neither potassic bichromate nor mercuric
chloride precipitates cytisine, even though the solution be concentrated.
The best single test appears to be the reaction discovered by Magelhaes;
this consists in adding thymol to a solution of cytisine in concentrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>

from 30 to 40 mgrms. fatal to cats; death was from paralysis of the
respiration, and could be avoided by artificial respiration. Cattle are
sometimes accidentally poisoned by laburnum. An instance of this is
recorded in the <i>Veterinarian</i> (vol. lv. p. 92). In Lanark a storm had
blown a large laburnum tree down to the ground; it fell into a field
in which some young heifers were grazing, and they began to feed on
the leaves and pods. Two or three died, and three more were ill for
some time, but ultimately recovered.</p>

<p>The laburnum, however, does not always have this effect, for there is
a case related in the <i>Gardeners&#8217; Chronicle</i>, in which five cows browsed
for some time on the branches and pods of an old laburnum tree that
had been thrown aside. Rabbits and hares are said to feed eagerly, and
without injury, on the pods and branches.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_469" id="Sect_469"></a>&sect; 469. <b>Effects on Man.</b>&mdash;The sweet taste of many portions of the
laburnum tree, as well as its attractive appearance, has been the cause
of many accidents. F. A. Falck has been able to collect from medical
literature no less than 155 cases&mdash;120 of which were those of the
accidental poisoning of children: only 4 (or 2&middot;6 per cent.), however,
died, so that the poison is not of a very deadly character.</p>

<p>One of the earliest recorded cases is by Christison.<a name="FNanchor_519" id="FNanchor_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> A servant-girl
of Inverness, in order to excite vomiting in her fellow-servant (the
cook), boiled some laburnum bark in soup; very soon after partaking of
this soup, the cook experienced violent vomiting, which lasted for thirty-six
hours; she had intense pain in the stomach, much diarrh&#339;a, and great
muscular weakness; she appears to have suffered from gastro-intestinal
catarrh for some time, but ultimately recovered.</p>

boys, who ate the root of an old laburnum tree, being allured by its
sweet taste. All were taken ill with similar symptoms, differing only in
severity; two who had eaten half an ounce (nearly 8 grms.) suffered with
especial severity. The symptoms were first vomiting, then narcosis, with
convulsive movements of the legs and strange movements of the arms:
the pupils were dilated. This dilatation of the pupil Sedgwick also saw
in the poisoning of two children who ate the root. On the other hand,
when the flower, seeds, or other portions of the laburnum have been
eaten, the symptoms are mainly referable to the gastro-intestinal tract,
consisting of acute pain in the stomach, vomiting, and diarrh&#339;a. On
these grounds it is therefore more than probable that there is another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>The method which Wright and Luff adopted to extract and separate
these alkaloids from the root of <i>V. album</i> and <i>V. viride</i>, essentially consisted
in exhausting with alcohol, to which a little tartaric acid has been
added, filtering, distilling off the alcohol, dissolving the residue in water,
alkalising with caustic soda, and shaking up with ether. The ethereal
solution was next separated, and then washed with water containing
tartaric acid, so as to obtain a solution of the bases as tartrates: in this
way the same ether could be used over and over again. Ultimately a
rough separation was made by means of the different solubilities in
ether, pseudo-jervine being scarcely soluble in this medium, whilst
jervine, veratralbine, veratrine, and cevadine are very soluble in it.</p>

of veratrine, that it is almost absent in <i>V. viride</i>; on the other hand,
<i>V. viride</i> contains a fair quantity of cevadine, an alkaloid absent in

<p>Three of these alkaloids possess powerful sternutatory properties, the
least quantity applied to the nostrils exciting sneezing; the three are
veratrine, cevadine, and protoveratrine.</p>

<p>Protoveratrine, <span class="chemform">C<sub>32</sub>H<sub>51</sub>NO<sub>11</sub></span>, has been obtained by G. Salzberger<a name="FNanchor_523" id="FNanchor_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a>
from powdered hellebore root, by the following process:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The powdered root is first freed from fatty and resinous matters by
treatment with ether, and then the fat-free powder is exhausted with
alcohol. The alcohol is evaporated off in a vacuum, the extract mixed
with much acetic acid water, filtered from the insoluble residue, and
treated with metaphosphoric acid; the voluminous precipitate contains
much amorphous matter, with insoluble compounds of jervine and
rubi-jervine. The precipitate is filtered off, and the filtrate treated
with excess of ammonia and shaken up with ether. On separating
the ether and distilling, protoveratrine crystallises out, and can be
obtained pure by recrystallisation from strong alcohol.</p>

<p>Protoveratrine crystallises in four-sided plates, which melt with charring
at 245&deg; to 250&deg;. The base is insoluble in water, benzene, and light
petroleum; chloroform and boiling 96 per cent. alcohol dissolve it somewhat;
cold ether scarcely touches it, boiling ether dissolves it a little.</p>

<p>Concentrated sulphuric acid dissolves the alkaloid slowly with the
production of a greenish colour, which passes to cornflower blue, and,
after some hours, becomes violet. Sulphuric acid and sugar gives a
different colour to that produced by commercial veratrine. There is
first a green colour which darkens into olive green, then becomes dirty
green, and finally dark brown. When warmed with strong sulphuric,
hydrochloric, or phosphoric acids, there is a strong odour of isobutyric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
acid developed. Dilute solutions of the salts are precipitated by ammonia,
Nessler&#8217;s reagent, gold chloride, potassium mercury iodide, cadmium iodide,
phosphotungstic acid, and picric acid; no precipitate is produced by tannin,
platinum chloride, or mercuric chloride.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_471" id="Sect_471"></a>&sect; 471. <b>Veratrine</b> (<span class="chemform">C<sub>37</sub>H<sub>53</sub>NO<sub>11</sub></span>) is a crystallisable alkaloid, which is a
powerful irritant of the sensory nerves of the mucous membrane, and
excites violent sneezing. Treated with concentrated sulphuric acid, it
dissolves with a yellow colour, deepening into orange, then into blood-red,
and finally passing into carmine-red. If the freshly-prepared sulphuric
acid solution is now treated with bromine water, a beautiful purple
colour is produced. Concentrated hydrochloric acid dissolves veratrine
without the production of colour, but, with careful warming, it becomes
beautifully red. This reaction is very delicate, occurring with &middot;17 mgrm.
On saponification veratrine yields veratric acid.</p>

<p>Veratric acid is procatechu-dimethylether acid, and has the constitutional
formula,</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>Veratric acid forms colourless needles and four-sided prisms which have
a marked acid reaction; it melts on heating to a colourless fluid, and
sublimes without decomposition; it is easily soluble in hot alcohol, but
insoluble in ether. If dissolved in nitric acid, water separates nitro-veratric
acid, <span class="chemform">C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>9</sub>(NO<sub>2</sub>)O<sub>4</sub></span> which crystallises out of alcohol in small
yellow scales. Veratric acid unites with bases forming crystalline salts;
the silver salt has the composition of <span class="chemform">C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>9</sub>AgO<sub>4</sub></span> = 37&middot;37 per cent. silver,
and may assist in identification. It is crystalline with a melting point of

<p>According to Ahrens, angelic acid is first formed, and then converted
into tiglic acid. When the alkaloid is boiled with hydrochloric acid,
tiglic acid is formed, and a ruby red mass. Nitric acid oxidises cevadine
completely; with potassic permanganate it yields acetic and oxalic acids;
with chromic acid it forms acetaldehyde and carbon dioxide.<a name="FNanchor_525" id="FNanchor_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a></p>

<p>The Continental authorities always give to cevadine the name

alcohol. It is insoluble in light petroleum, and but slightly soluble in ethyl
acetate, water, or carbon bisulphide. It forms a very insoluble sulphate,
and a sparingly soluble nitrate and hydrochloride. Jervine gives, with
sulphuric acid and sugar, a violet colour, passing to blue. Treated with
strong sulphuric acid it dissolves to a yellow fluid, which becomes successively
dark yellow, brownish yellow, and then greenish. The green shade
is immediately developed by diluting with water. Jervine does not
produce sneezing.</p>

<p>From the dark green syrup obtained jervine crystallised out, and from

<p>Protoveratridine crystallises in colourless four-sided plates, which melt
at 265&deg;. It is almost insoluble in alcohol, chloroform, methyl alcohol,
and acetone, and insoluble in benzene, light petroleum, and ether. Concentrated
sulphuric acid gives a violet, then a cherry-red colour. Its
solution in concentrated hydrochloric acid becomes light red on warming,
and there is an odour of isobutyric acid. It is readily soluble in dilute
mineral acids, and the solution, on the addition of ammonia, yields the
alkaloid in a crystalline condition. The sulphuric acid solution gives
precipitates with phosphotungstic, picric, and tannic acids, and with
potassium mercury iodide; but gives no precipitate with platinum

dark yellow, brownish yellow, and brownish blood-red, changing after
several hours to a brownish purple. On diluting slightly with water the

<p><a name="Sect_478" id="Sect_478"></a>&sect; 478. <b>Commercial Veratrine.</b>&mdash;Commercial veratrine is a mixture of
alkaloids, and has usually fairly constant properties, one of which is its
intense irritant action on the nostrils. Placed on moist blue-red litmus
paper it gives a blue spot. It is but little soluble in water, 1&nbsp;: 1500; but
readily dissolves in alcohol and chloroform; it is but little soluble in
amyl alcohol, benzene, and carbon disulphide.</p>

<p>When a very small quantity is treated with a drop of sulphuric acid,
the acid in the cold strikes a yellow colour; on warming, the colour
becomes violet, slowly changing to orange and cherry red. Sensible to
100th of mgrm. If this test is performed in a test-tube, a green-yellow
fluorescence is also seen on the sides of the test-tube.</p>

<p>Commercial veratrine strikes a pink-red colour with hydrochloric acid
in the cold if a long time is allowed to elapse, but it at once appears if the
acid is warmed, and is permanent. The solution becomes fluorescent if
two drops of acetic acid are added.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span></p>

<p>If a small quantity of commercial veratrine is added to melted oxalic
acid and the warming continued, a blood-red colour is obtained.</p>

<p>Veratrine, warmed with syrupy phosphoric acid, develops an odour of
butyric acid.</p>

<p>A dark green colour, followed by reddish purple and blue colours, is
obtained by adding a sprinkling of finely-powdered sugar to a solution of
veratrine in sulphuric acid. This is best seen with a solution of 1 to
10,000; if in dilution of 1 to 100,000 a grass-green colour is produced,
followed by purple and blue colours, quickly changing to brown or black.<a name="FNanchor_529" id="FNanchor_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a></p>

<p>When two or three drops of sulphuric acid and furfur aldehyde (5 drops
to 10 c.c. of acid) are added to minute particles of alkaloids, a more or
less characteristic colour makes its appearance; this is particularly the
case with veratrine. A few particles rubbed with a glass rod, and
moistened with the reagent, gives first a yellowish-green, then an olive-green
mixture, the edges afterwards becoming a beautiful blue. On
warming, the mixture gradually acquires a purple-violet colour. The
blue substance obtained in the cold is insoluble in alcohol, ether, or
chloroform. The least amount of water decolorises the solution, and, on
adding much water, a fairly permanent yellow solution is obtained.<a name="FNanchor_530" id="FNanchor_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a></p>

exercises a peculiar influence on voluntary muscle; the contractility is
changed, so that, when excited, there is a long-continuing contraction,
and from a single stimulus more heat is disengaged than with healthy
muscle; the motor nerves are also affected. The respiration, at first
quickened, is then slowed, and finally paralysed. The heart&#8217;s action
is also first quickened, the blood-pressure at the same time is raised, and
the small arteries narrowed in calibre; later follow sinking of the
pressure, slowing of the heart, and dilatation of the vessels, and the
heart becomes finally paralysed.</p>

alcohol by careful distillation, and the extract taken up with water. By
now acidifying gently the watery extract, and shaking it up with ether
and chloroform, fatty matters, resinous substances, and other impurities,
are removed, and it may then be alkalised by soda or potash, and the
veratrine extracted by ether. The residue should be identified by the
hydrochloric acid and by the sulphuric acid and bromine reactions; care
should also be taken to ascertain whether it excites sneezing.</p>

<h4>VIII.&mdash;Physostigmine.</h4>

<p><a name="Sect_486" id="Sect_486"></a>&sect; 486. The ordeal bean of Calabar (<i>Physostigma faba</i>) is a large, all
but tasteless, kidney-shaped bean, about an inch in length, and half an
inch thick; its convex edge has a furrow with elevated ridges, and is
pierced by a small hole at one extremity. The integuments are coffee-brown
in colour, thin, hard, and brittle; they enclose two white cotyledons,
easily pulverisable, and weighing on an average 3&middot;98 grms.
(61 grains). The seed contains at least one alkaloid, termed <i>Physostigmine</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
(first separated in 1864 by Jobst and Hesse), and possibly a second,
according to Harnack and Witkowsky, who have discovered in association
with physostigmine a new alkaloid, which they call <i>Calabarine</i>, and which
differs from physostigmine in being insoluble in ether and soluble in
water. It is also soluble in alcohol; and further, the precipitate produced
by potassium iodo-hydrargyrate in calabarine solutions is insoluble
in alcohol.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_487" id="Sect_487"></a>&sect; 487. <b>Physostigmine</b>, or <b>eserine</b>, is not easily obtained in a crystalline
state, being most frequently extracted as a colourless varnish, drying
into brittle masses. It is, however, quite possible to obtain it in the
form of partially-crystalline crusts, or even rhombic plates, by care being
taken to perform the evaporation, and all the operations, at as low a
temperature as possible, and preferably in a dimly-lit room; for, if the
temperature rises to 40&deg;, much of the alkaloid will be decomposed.
Hesse recommends that the beans be extracted, alcohol by the alcoholic
solution alkalised by sodic carbonate, and the liquid shaken up with
ether, which will retain the alkaloid. The ether solution is now separated,
and acidified slightly with very dilute sulphuric acid; the fluid, of course,
separates into two layers, the lower of which contains the alkaloid as a
sulphate, the upper is the ether, which is withdrawn, and the acid fluid
passed through a moist filter. The whole process is then repeated as a
purification.</p>

<p>Again, Vee, who has repeatedly obtained the alkaloid in a crystalline
condition, directs the extraction of the beans by alcohol, the alcoholic
solution to be treated as before with sodic carbonate, and then with ether;
the ethereal solution to be evaporated to dryness, dissolved in dilute acid,
precipitated by sugar of lead, and the filtrate from this precipitate alkalised
by potassic bicarbonate, and then shaken up with ether. The ethereal
solution is permitted to evaporate spontaneously, the crystalline crusts
are dissolved in a little dilute acid, and the solution is lastly alkalised
by potassic bicarbonate, when, after a few minutes, crystalline plates are
formed.</p>

<p>The formula ascribed to physostigmine is <span class="chemform">C<sub>15</sub>H<sub>21</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub></span>. It is strongly
alkaline, fully neutralising acids and forming tasteless salts. It is easily
melted, and perhaps partly decomposed, at a temperature of 45&deg;; at 100&deg;
it is certainly changed, becoming of a red colour, and forming with acids
a red solution. It dissolves easily in alcohol, ether, chloroform, and bisulphide
of carbon, but is not easily soluble in water.</p>

<p>The salts formed by the alkaloid with the acids are generally hygroscopic
and uncrystallisable, but an exception is met with in the hydrobromide,
which crystallises in stellate groups.<a name="FNanchor_537" id="FNanchor_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> If CO<sub>2</sub> is passed into
water containing the alkaloid in suspension, a clear solution is obtained;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
but the slightest warmth decomposes the soluble salt and reprecipitates
the alkaloid. The hydrarg-hydroiodide (<span class="chemform">C<sub>15</sub>H<sub>21</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>,HI,2HgI</span>) is a
white precipitate, insoluble in water, becoming yellow on drying, soluble
in ether and alcohol, and from such solutions obtained in crystalline
prismatic groups. A heat of 70&deg; melts the crystals, and they solidify
again in the amorphous condition.</p>

fragment of eserine or one of its salts is dissolved in a few drops of
fuming nitric acid; this makes a yellow solution, but evaporated to
complete dryness it is pure green. The green substance, called by others
chloreserine, dissolves to a non-fluorescent green solution; in water and
also in strong alcohol it shows a band in the red between &#955;670 and &#955;688,
a broader but more nebulous band in the blue and violet between &#955;400
and &#955;418, and a very feeble band in the orange.</p>

<p>J. B. Nagelvoort<a name="FNanchor_539" id="FNanchor_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> has recommended the following tests:&mdash;(<i>a</i>) An
amorphous residue of a permanent blue colour is obtained if a trace of
the alkaloid, or one of its salts, is evaporated in the presence of an excess
of ammonia; this blue alkaloid dissolves in dilute acids with a red colour;
sensitiveness 0&middot;00001 gm. (1&nbsp;: 100000). The solution has beautiful red
fluorescence in reflected light; when evaporated, it leaves a residue that
is green at first, changing to blue afterwards, the blue residue being
soluble in water, alcohol, and chloroform, but not in ether. Chloroform
extracts the blue colour from the watery ammoniacal solution only partially.
The blue solutions are reddened at first by <span class="chemform">H<sub>2</sub>S</span>, and discoloured
afterwards. The blue colour is restored by expelling the <span class="chemform">H<sub>2</sub>S</span> on the
water-bath. (<i>b</i>) A red fluid is obtained when 0&middot;010 gm. eserine or its
salicylate, 0&middot;050 gm. of slacked lime, and 1 c.c. of water are added
together. Warmed in a water-bath, it turns green, and a piece of red
litmus-paper suspended in the test-tube turns blue; a glass rod
moistened with <span class="chemform">HCl</span> gives off the well-known white clouds characteristic
of an ammonia reaction. The green solution does not lose its
colour by evaporation. Baryta water, added to an eserine solution,
gives a white precipitate that turns red when strongly agitated,
sensitive to 0&middot;01 mgrm. (1&nbsp;: 100000).</p>

principally for external application, the dose of which is not more than
18&middot;1 mgrms. (&middot;18 grain), and gelatine discs for the purpose of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>

<p><a name="Sect_490" id="Sect_490"></a>&sect; 490. <b>Effects on Animals.</b>&mdash;A large number of experiments have
been made upon animals with physostigmine, most of them with the
impure alkaloid, which is a mixture of calabarine and physostigmine.
Now, the action of calabarine seems to be the opposite to that of physostigmine&mdash;that
is, it causes tetanus. Hence, these experiments are not
of much value, unless the different proportions of the alkaloids were
known. Harnack and Witkowsky<a name="FNanchor_540" id="FNanchor_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> made, however, some researches
with pure physostigmine, of which the following are the main results:&mdash;The
smallest fatal dose for rabbits is 3 mgrms. per kilo.; cats about the
same; while dogs take from 4 to 5 mgrms. per kilo. Frogs, under the
influence of the alkaloid, lie paralysed without the power of spontaneous
movement, and the sensibility is diminished; later, the breathing ceases,
and the reflex irritability becomes extinguished. The activity of the
heart is through &middot;5 mgrm. slowed, but at the same time strengthened.</p>

<p>The warm-blooded animals experimented upon show rapid paralysis of
the respiratory centre, but the animal by artificial respiration can be
saved. Fibrillar muscular twitching of all the muscles of the body are
observed. Death follows in all cases from paralysis of the respiration.
Experiments (first by Bexold, then by Fraser and Bartholow, and lastly
by Schroff) have amply shown that atropine is, to a certain extent, an
antidote for physostigmine poisoning. Fraser also maintains an antagonism
between strychnine and physostigmine, and Bennet that chloral
hydrate is antagonistic to physostigmine.</p>

<p><b>Effects on Man.</b>&mdash;The bean has long been used by the superstitious
tribes of the West Coast of Africa as an ordeal, and is so implicitly
believed in that the innocent, when accused of theft, will swallow it,
in the full conviction that their innocency will protect them, and that
they will vomit up the bean and live. In this way, no doubt, life has
often been sacrificed. Christison experimented upon himself with the
bean, and nearly lost his life. He took 12 grains, and was then seized
with giddiness and a general feeling of torpor. Being alarmed at the
symptoms, he took an emetic, which acted. He was giddy, faint, and
seemed to have lost all muscular power; the heart and pulse were
extremely feeble, and beat irregularly. He afterwards fell into a sleep,
and the next day he was quite well.</p>

<p>In August 1864 forty-six children were poisoned at Liverpool by
eating some of the beans, which had been thrown on a rubbish heap,
being part of the cargo of a ship from the West Coast of Africa. A boy,
aged six, ate six beans, and died. In April of the same year, two
children, aged six and three years, chewed and ate the broken fragments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
of one bean; the usual symptoms of gastric irritation and muscular
weakness followed, but both recovered. Physostigmine contracts the iris
to a point; the action is quite local, and is confined to the eye to which
it is applied. When administered internally, according to some, it has
no effect on the eyes, but according to others, it has a weak effect in
contracting the pupil. In any case, the difference of opinion shows that
the effect, when internally administered, is not one of a marked character.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_491" id="Sect_491"></a>&sect; 491. <b>Physiological Action.</b>&mdash;The physiological action of physostigmine
is strikingly like that of nicotine, which it resembles in being a
respiratory poison, first exciting, afterwards paralysing the vagus. Like
nicotine, also, it produces a great loss of muscular power; it first excites,
and then paralyses the intra-muscular terminations of the nerves; and,
again, like nicotine, it induces a tetanus of the intestine. A difference
between physostigmine and nicotine exists in the constant convulsive
effects of the former, and in the greater influence on the heart of the
latter.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_492" id="Sect_492"></a>&sect; 492. <b>Post-mortem Appearances.</b>&mdash;But little is known relative to the
<i>post-mortem</i> appearances likely to be found in human poisoning; redness
of the stomach and intestines is probably the chief sign.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_493" id="Sect_493"></a>&sect; 493. <b>Separation of Physostigmine.</b>&mdash;For the extraction of physostigmine
from the fluids of the body, Dragendorff recommends benzene: the
alcoholic filtered extract (first acidified) may be agitated with such solvents
as petroleum and benzene, in order to remove colouring matter; then
alkalised and shaken up with benzene, and the latter allowed to evaporate
spontaneously&mdash;all the operations being, as before stated, carried on
under 40&deg;. If much coloured, it may be purified according to the principles
before mentioned. In cases where enough of the extract (or other
medicinal preparation) has been taken to destroy life, the analyst, with
proper care, would probably not have much difficulty in separating a small
quantity of the active principle. It is rapidly eliminated by the saliva
and other secretions. In most cases it will be necessary to identify physostigmine
by its physiological activity, as well as by its chemical characters.
For this purpose a small quantity of the substance should be
inserted in the eye of a rabbit; if it contains the alkaloid in question, in
twenty minutes, at the very latest, there will be a strong contraction of
the pupil, and a congested state of the conjunctival vessels. Further
researches may be made with a small quantity on a bird or frog. The
chief symptoms observed will be those of paralysis of the respiratory and
voluntary muscles, followed by death. If a solution is applied to the
web of a frog&#8217;s foot, the blood-vessels become dilated. Physostigmine
appears, according to Dragendorff and Pander, to act as an irritant, for
they always observed gastro-enteritis as a result of the poison, even
when injected subcutaneously. The enhanced secretion from all mucous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
surfaces, and the enlargement of the blood-vessels, are also very constant
symptoms. But of all these characteristics, the contraction of the pupil
is, for the purposes of identification, the principal. A substance extracted
from the tissue or other organic matters, in the manner mentioned,
strongly contracting the pupil and giving the bromine reaction, would, in
the present state of our knowledge, be indicative of physostigmine, and
of that alone.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_494" id="Sect_494"></a>&sect; 494. <b>Fatal Dose of Physostigmine.</b>&mdash;One mgrm. (&middot;015 grain) as
sulphate, given by Vee to a woman subcutaneously, caused vomiting, &amp;c.,
after half an hour. A disciple of Gubler&#8217;s took 2 mgrms. without
apparent effect; but another mgrm., a little time after, caused great contraction
of the pupil and very serious symptoms, which entirely passed
off in four hours. It would thus seem that three times this (<i>i.e.</i>,
6 mgrms.) would be likely to be dangerous. If so, man is far more
sensitive to physostigmine than dogs or cats; and 3 mgrms. per kilo.&mdash;that
is, about 205 mgrms. (3 grains)&mdash;would be much beyond the least
fatal dose.</p>

<h4>IX.&mdash;Pilocarpine.</h4>

<p><a name="Sect_495" id="Sect_495"></a>&sect; 495. From the leaves of the jaborandi, <i>Pilocarpus pennatafolius</i>
(Nat. Ord. <i>Rutace&aelig;</i>), two alkaloids have been separated&mdash;<i>jaborandi</i> and
<i>pilocarpine</i>.</p>

<p><b>Jaborandi</b> (<span class="chemform">C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>12</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub></span>) is a strong base, differing from pilocarpine in
its sparing solubility in water, and more ready solubility in ether; its
salts are soluble in water and alcohol, but do not crystallise. P. Ghastaing,<a name="FNanchor_541" id="FNanchor_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a>
by treating pilocarpine with a large quantity of nitric acid,
obtained nitrate of jaborandi, and operating in the same way with hydrochloric
acid, obtained the hydrochlorate of jaborandi; hence, it seems
that jaborandi is derived from pilocarpine.</p>

with the mineral acids crystallisable salts. The solutions are dextra-rotatory.
On boiling with water, it decomposes into trimethylamine and
m-pyridine lactic acid,</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illo437a.png" alt="Pilocarpine" width="342" height="50" />

<p>hence it is a pyridine derivative, and its graphic formula probably</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span></p>

<p>The nitrate and hydrochloride are at present much used in pharmacy.
Pilocarpine gives a precipitate with phosphomolybdic acid, potassio-mercuric
iodide, and most general alkaloidal reagents, but none that are
very distinctive. When a solution of gold chloride is added to one of
pilocarpine, a salt falls, having the composition <span class="chemform">C<sub>11</sub>H<sub>16</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>,HCl</span> + <span class="chemform">AuCl<sub>3</sub></span>.
It is not very soluble in water (about 1 in 4600), and has been utilised
for the estimation of pilocarpine. Pilocarpine fused with potash yields
trimethylamine, carbon dioxide, butyric, and traces of acetic acid.
Pilocarpine dissolves without the production of colour in sulphuric
acid; but, with bichromate of potash and sulphuric acid, a green colour
is produced. It may be extracted from an aqueous solution made
alkaline by ammonia, by shaking up with chloroform or benzene.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_497" id="Sect_497"></a>&sect; 497. <b>Tests.</b>&mdash;When a little of the alkaloid is mixed with ten times
its weight of calomel, and rubbed, and moistened by the breath, the
calomel is blackened; cocaine also acts similarly; but the two could not
be mistaken for each other. If a solution of mercur-potassium iodide is
added to a solution of the hydrochloride, the amorphous precipitate
becomes, in the course of a day or two, oily drops. &#8220;A solution of iodine
in potassium iodide gives in pilocarpine solutions a brown precipitate
that often crystallises to feathery brown crystals (microscopically), and
of serrated form, something like the blade of a scroll-saw, when the
crystallisation is incomplete.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Fl&uuml;ckiger&#8217;s Reactions.</i></p>

<p><a name="Sect_498" id="Sect_498"></a>&sect; 498. <b>Effects.</b>&mdash;Pilocarpine, given subcutaneously in doses of about 32
mgrms. (<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> grain), causes within five minutes a profuse perspiration and
salivation, the face becomes flushed, and the whole body sweats; at the
same time, the buccal secretion is so much increased that in a few hours
over a pint may be secreted. The tears, the bronchial secretion, and the
intestinal secretions are also augmented; there are generally headache
and a frequent desire to pass water; the pulse is much quickened, and
the temperature falls from 1&deg;&middot;4 to 4&deg;: the symptoms last from two to
five hours. Langley has shown that the over-action of the submaxillary
gland is not affected by section either of the <i>chorda tympani</i> or of the
sympathetic supplying the gland. Although pilocarpine quickens the
pulse of man, it slows, according to Langley,<a name="FNanchor_542" id="FNanchor_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> the heart of the warm-blooded
animals, and that of the frog. With regard to the frog, Dr. S.
Ringer&#8217;s researches are confirmatory. With large doses the heart stops
in diastole. If to the heart thus slowed, or even when recently stopped,
a minute quantity of atropine be applied, it begins to beat again. There
is also a most complete antagonism between atropine and pilocarpine in
other respects, atropine stopping the excessive perspiration, and relieving
the headache and pain about the pubes, &amp;c. Pilocarpine, given internally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
does not alter the size of the pupil, but the sight may, with large doses,
be affected. If a solution is applied direct to the eye, then the pupil
contracts. No fatal case of its administration has occurred in man.
The probable dangerous dose would be about 130 mgrms. (2 grains)
administered subcutaneously. Pilocarpine must be classed among the
heart poisons.</p>

<h4>X.&mdash;Taxine.</h4>

other portions of the yew tree (<i>Taxus baccata</i>), are poisonous. The
poison is alkaloidal, and was first separated by Marm&eacute;.</p>

<p><b>Taxine</b> (<span class="chemform">C<sub>37</sub>H<sub>52</sub>O<sub>10</sub>N</span>).&mdash;Taxine cannot be obtained in crystals, but as a
snow-white amorphous powder, scarcely soluble in water, but dissolving

than 32 cases of poisoning by different parts of the yew&mdash;9 were from
the berries, and the rest from the leaves. They were all accidental;
20 persons died, or 62&middot;5 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_501" id="Sect_501"></a>&sect; 501. <b>Effects on Animals&mdash;Physiological Action.</b>&mdash;From the researches
of Marm&eacute;-Borchers, it appears that taxine acts upon the nervous
centres&mdash;the nervous trunks themselves and the muscles remaining with
their excitability unimpaired, even some time after death. Taxine kills
through paralysis of the respiration, the heart beating after the breathing
has stopped. The leaves contain much formic acid, and their irritant
action on the intestine is referred to this cause.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_502" id="Sect_502"></a>&sect; 502. <b>Effects on Man.</b>&mdash;Several deaths from yew have resulted in
lunatic asylums from the patients chewing the leaves. For example, a
few years ago, at the Cheshire County Asylum, a female, aged 41, was
suddenly taken ill, apparently fainting, her face pale, her eyes shut, and
pulse almost imperceptible. Upon the administration of stimulants, she
somewhat revived, but in a little while became quite unconscious. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
pupils were contracted, and there were epileptiform convulsions, succeeded
by stertorous breathing. These convulsions returned from time
to time, the action of the heart became weaker, and there was a remarkable
slowing of the respirations, with long intervals between the breathing.
The woman died within an hour from the time when her illness was
first observed, and within two hours of eating the leaves. Yew leaves
were found in her stomach. In another case that occurred at the Parkside
Asylum,<a name="FNanchor_544" id="FNanchor_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> the patient died suddenly in a sort of epileptic fit. Yew
leaves were again found in the stomach. In a case quoted by Taylor, in
which a decoction of the leaves was drunk by a girl, aged 15, for the
purpose of exciting menstruation, she took the decoction on four successive
mornings. Severe vomiting followed, and she died eight hours after
taking the last dose. In another case there were also no symptoms
except vomiting, followed by rapid death. Mr. Hurt, of Mansfield, has
recorded a case of poisoning by the berries. The child died in convulsions
before it was seen by any medical man.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>From these and other recorded cases, the symptoms seem generally to
be a quick pulse, fainting or collapse, nausea, vomiting, convulsions, slow
respiration, and death, as a rule sudden and unexpected. We may suppose
that the sudden death is really due to a rapid paralysis of the
respiration, and suffocation.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_503" id="Sect_503"></a>&sect; 503. <b>Post-Mortem Appearances.</b>&mdash;In the case of the girl who
drank the decoction, nothing unusual was observed in the stomach
or organs of the body; but when the leaves have been eaten, usually
more or less congestion of the mucous membrane of the stomach, as well
as of the bowels, is apparent. In the case of the child who ate the
berries (Hurt&#8217;s case), the stomach was filled with mucous and half-digested
pulp of the berries and seeds. The mucous membrane was
red in patches and softened, and the small intestines were also inflamed.</p>

<h4>XI.&mdash;Curarine.</h4>

<p><a name="Sect_504" id="Sect_504"></a>&sect; 504. Commercial curare is a black, shining, resinoid mass, about 83
per cent. of which is soluble in water, and 79 in weak spirit. It is a
complicated mixture of vegetable extracts, from which, however, a definite
principle possessing basic characters (<i>curarine</i>) has been separated.</p>

<p>The extract is an arrow poison<a name="FNanchor_545" id="FNanchor_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> prepared by different tribes of Indians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
in South America, between the Amazon and the Orinoco; therefore,
samples are found to vary much in their poisoning properties, although
it is noticeable that qualitatively they are the same, and produce closely
analogous symptoms. It is supposed that some of the curare is derived
from different species of strychnos. This is the more probable, because,
as before stated, the South American strychnines paralyse, and do not
tetanise. It is not unlikely that the active principles of curare (or
woorari) may be methyl compounds similar to those which have been
artificially prepared, such as methyl strychnine and methyl brucine, both
of which have a curare-like action.</p>

principle obtained from a leguminous plant, the <i>Derris elliptica</i>; it
is a resinous substance, which has not yet been obtained in the pure
state. It is said not to be a glucoside, nor to contain any nitrogen
(Greshoff, <i>Ber.</i>, xxiii. 3537-3550).</p>

<p>The Comalis on the east coast of Africa prepare an arrow poison from the
aqueous extract of the root of Oubaion, a tree closely related to

glucoside, yielding on boiling with dilute acids a sugar. It is very
poisonous; 2 mgrms. will kill a dog of 12 kilos. weight in a few
minutes, if subcutaneously injected; but, taken by the stomach, it
produces no effect.&mdash;Arnaud, <i>Compt. Rend.</i>, cvi. 1011-1014.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p><b>Curarine</b> was first separated by Preyer in a crystalline form in 1865.
He extracted curare with boiling alcohol, to which a few drops of
soda solution had been added, evaporated off the alcohol, took up the
extract with water, and, after filtration, precipitated by phosphomolybdic
acid, which had been acidified with nitric acid. The precipitate was
dried up with baryta water, exhausted with boiling alcohol, and curarine
precipitated from the alcoholic solution by anhydrous ether. It may also
be obtained by precipitating with mercuric chloride solution, and throwing
out the mercury afterwards by means of hydric sulphide, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Curarine, when pure, forms colourless, four-sided, very hygroscopic
prisms of bitter taste, and weakly alkaline reaction; soluble in water
and alcohol in all proportions, but with difficulty soluble in amyl alcohol
and chloroform, and not at all in anhydrous ether, bisulphide of carbon,
or benzene. The base forms crystallisable salts with hydrochloric, nitric,
and acetic acids. Curarine strikes a purple colour with strong nitric
acid. Concentrated solutions of curarine mixed with dilute glycerin,
give an amorphous precipitate with potassic bichromate, and the precipitate
treated with sulphuric acid strikes a beautiful blue colour. Curarine
chromate is distinguished from strychnine chromate by its amorphous
character, and by its comparatively easy solubility. If the chromates of
strychnine and curarine be mixed, and the mixed chromates be treated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
with ammonia, strychnine will be precipitated, and curarine pass into
solution, thus forming a ready method of separating them.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_505" id="Sect_505"></a>&sect; 505. <b>Physiological Effects.</b>&mdash;According to Voisin and Liouville&#8217;s
experiments, subcutaneous injections of curare on man cause, in small
doses, strong irritation at the place of application, swelling, and pain.
The temperature of the body is raised from 1&deg; to 2&deg;, and the number of
respirations increased from 4 to 8 per minute. The pulse becomes somewhat
stronger and more powerful. The urine is increased, and contains
sugar. Large doses administered to warm-blooded animals cause, after a
short time, complete paralysis of voluntary motion and of reflex excitability,
and the animal dies in asphyxia, the heart continuing to beat.</p>

<p>This state is best produced for the purpose of experiment on frogs, and,
indeed, is the best test for the poison. A very minute dose injected
beneath the skin of a frog soon paralyses both the voluntary and respiratory
muscles; the animal continues to breathe by the skin; the heart
beats normally, or, perhaps, a little weakly, and the frog may remain in
this motionless condition for days and yet recover. Only curare and its
congeners have this effect. By tying the femoral artery of one of the
frog&#8217;s legs before administering the poison, an insight into the true action
of the drug is obtained. It is then found that the reflex excitability and
power of motion in the leg are retained, although all the rest of the body
is paralysed. The only explanation of this is that curare does not act
centrally, but paralyses the intramuscular ends of the motor nerves.
Curare is eliminated partly through the liver and partly through the
kidneys. Dragendorff found it in the f&aelig;ces, while a striking proof that
it is excreted by the kidneys is given by the experiment of Bidder,<a name="FNanchor_546" id="FNanchor_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> in
which the urine of a frog poisoned by curare was made to poison a
second, and the urine of the second, a third. The easy excretion of curare
through the kidneys furnishes an explanation of the relatively large
dose of curare which can be taken by the stomach without injury. A
dose which, given by subcutaneous injection, would produce violent
symptoms, perhaps death, may yet be swallowed, and no ill effects
follow. It is hence presumed that, in the first case, the poison is,
comparatively speaking, slowly absorbed, and almost as fast separated,
and put, as it were, outside the body by going into the urine; while, in
the other case, the whole dose is thrown suddenly into the circulation.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_506" id="Sect_506"></a>&sect; 506. <b>Separation of Curarine.</b>&mdash;It is hardly probable that the toxicologist
will have to look for curarine, unless it has entered the body by
means of a wound or by subcutaneous injection; so that in all cases the
absorbed poison alone must be sought for. The seat of entry, the liver,
the kidneys, and the urine are the only parts likely to be of any use.
Dragendorff recommends the extraction of the tissues with water feebly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
acidulated with a mineral acid, to precipitate albuminous matters, &amp;c., by
strong alcohol, and separate, by means of benzene, fatty matters. The
liquid is then made alkaline, and shaken up with petroleum ether, which
removes certain alkaloidal matters. It is now evaporated to dryness,
mixed with finely-powdered glass, and extracted with absolute alcohol.
The alcohol is evaporated to dryness, and any curarine extracted from
this residue with water. By very careful drying up of this last extract,
and taking it up in alcohol, the alkaloid is said to be obtained so pure as
to respond to chemical tests. The identification may be by the colour
reaction of sulphuric acid described <i>ante</i>, in all cases supplemented by
its physiological action on frogs.<a name="FNanchor_547" id="FNanchor_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a></p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_547" id="Footnote_547"></a><a href="#FNanchor_547"><span class="label">[547]</span></a> It is known that curare may cause slight symptoms of excitation
before the paralysis comes on. M. Couty has succeeded in isolating these
symptoms by employing feeble extracts of <i>Strychnos triplinervia</i>, or
small doses of certain native preparations. By these means, in dogs, a
new phase of intoxication may be present for ten or even twenty minutes.
In the first instance the animal is agitated, jumping, scratching,
barking, as if in a state of general hyper&aelig;sthesia. Then it presents
half choreic shocks or tremors; the pupils dilate, and are alternately
dilated and contracted. The heart&#8217;s action is increased or diminished in
frequency; sometimes there is vomiting, micturition, or defecation; and
there is always salivation. Finally, the central and peripheral
temperature are raised, and the excitability of the muscles and nerves
becomes highly increased. With the native preparation of curare, it is
impossible to prolong this stage, and symptoms of paralysis soon become
associated with those of excitement. The choreic shocks were found to be
arrested by section of the sciatic nerve. Other experiments proved that
the spasms originated from the spinal cord, and were influenced by its
preceding functional condition. If the cord was tied in the mid-dorsal
region, and the curare injected, the spasms were still produced in the
hind legs; but if, after the operation, the excitability of the
posterior segment became lowered, the spasm was no longer produced in
the hind legs. This dependence on a perfect functional activity is a
point of difference of these spasms from those produced by strychnine,
and by asphyxia. The action of small doses of curare is not, however,
limited to the spinal cord. The diminished frequency of the heart
continues after section of the pneumogastrics, and will even occur if
the pneumogastrics have been previously divided. From these facts M.
Couty considers that curare must not be regarded as entirely destitute
of a &#8220;convulsant&#8221; action, nor of an action on the central nervous
system.</p>

<h4>XII.&mdash;Colchicine.</h4>

<p><a name="Sect_507" id="Sect_507"></a>&sect; 507. The whole of the <i>Colchicum autumnale</i>, or common meadow-saffron,
is poisonous, owing to the presence of an alkaloid (discovered by
Pelletier and Caventou) called <i>Colchicine</i>.</p>

<p>According to Johannson&#8217;s experiments, the dried colchicum seeds contain
1&middot;15 per cent. of colchicine; the leaves, 1&middot;459 per cent.; the bulbs,
from 1&middot;4 to 1&middot;58 per cent.; and the roots, 0&middot;634 per cent. The frequent
poisoning of cattle in the autumn by colchicum, its use in quack pills for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
rheumatism, and its supposed occasional presence in beer, give it an
analytical importance.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_508" id="Sect_508"></a>&sect; 508. <b>Colchicine</b> (<span class="chemform">C<sub>22</sub>H<sub>25</sub>NO<sub>6</sub></span>) may be extracted from the seeds, &amp;c.,
in the manner recommended by H&uuml;bler:&mdash;The seeds are treated, without
crushing, by hot 90 per cent. alcohol, and the alcoholic solution evaporated
to a syrup, which is diluted with twenty times its bulk of water
and filtered; the liquid is next treated with acetate of lead, again filtered,
and the lead thrown out by phosphate of soda. Colchicine is now
precipitated as a tannate.<a name="FNanchor_548" id="FNanchor_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> The precipitation is best fractional, the first
and last portions being rejected as containing impurities. The tannate
is decomposed in the usual way with litharge and extracted by
alcohol.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_548" id="Footnote_548"></a><a href="#FNanchor_548"><span class="label">[548]</span></a> The purest tannic acid must be used. The commercial tannin may be
purified by evaporating to dryness with litharge, exhausting the tannate

suspending in water, and separating the lead by <span class="chemform">SH<sub class="tab">2</sub></span>.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>A simpler method is, however, extraction by chloroform from an
aqueous solution, feebly acidified, as recommended by Dragendorff.
The parts of the plant are digested in very dilute acid water, and the
resulting solution concentrated and shaken up with chloroform, which is
best done in a separating tube.</p>

<p>Colchicine contains four methoxyl groups, and its constitutional
formula is considered to be <span class="chemform">C<sub>15</sub>H<sub>9</sub>[NH(CH<sub>3</sub>CO)](COOCH<sub>3</sub>)(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub></span>.</p>

<p>Its melting-point is 143&deg;-147&deg;. It is usually a white, gummy mass.
It is easily soluble in cold water, in alcohol, and in chloroform. The
solutions are l&aelig;vorotatory. It is hardly soluble in ether. Boiling with
dilute acids or alkalies in closed tubes yields colchiceine.</p>

<p>Colchiceine contains three methoxyl groups. It melts at 150&deg;, dissolves
but little in cold, copiously in boiling water. Colchiceine appears
to be an acid, forming salts with the alkalies.</p>

<p>Zeisel<a name="FNanchor_549" id="FNanchor_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> has formed acetotrimethylcolchicinamide (<span class="chemform">NHAcC<sub>15</sub>H<sub>9</sub>(OMe)<sub>3</sub>CONH<sub>3</sub></span>)
by heating colchicine with alcoholic ammonia in closed tubes
for four hours at 100&deg;. The amide is crystallised from hot alcohol; it is
readily soluble in dilute <span class="chemform">HCl</span>, almost insoluble in water; when a strong
hydrochloric acid solution of the amide is treated with a small amount of
potassium nitrite a splendid violet colour is produced.</p>

themselves in all the pharmacop&#339;ias. The wine of colchicum, officinal
in nearly all the pharmacop&#339;ias, is made with very different proportions
of seeds or bulbs.</p>

<p>The tincture of colchicum is officinal in our own and in all the Continental
pharmacop&#339;ias; in the British, one part of seeds is exhausted by
eight parts of proof spirit.</p>

<p>A tincture of colchicum seeds, examined by Johannson, contained
&middot;18 per cent. of colchicine, and a tincture prepared from the bulbs
&middot;14 per cent.</p>

<p>Colchicum vinegar is not officinal in Britain, but one containing 5&middot;4
per cent. of acetic acid is so in the Netherlands, Germany, and France;
the strength appears to be about &middot;095 per cent. of colchicine.</p>

<p>An extract of colchicum is officinal in Britain and France; and an
acetic extract in Britain. The latter is the most active of all the pharmaceutical
preparations of colchicum.</p>

<p>Lastly, an oxymel of colchicum is in use in Germany, France, and the
Netherlands.</p>

<p><b>Quack and Patent Medicines.</b>&mdash;In all specifics for gout the analyst
will naturally search for colchicum. Most gout pills contain the extracts;
and liquids, such as &#8220;Reynolds&#8217; gout specific,&#8221; the wine or the tincture,
variously flavoured and disguised.</p>

<p>The strength of the different pharmaceutical preparations may be
ascertained by dissolving in chloroform, evaporating off the chloroform,
dissolving in water (which is finally acidified by from 7 to 10 per cent. of
sulphuric acid), and titrating with Mayer&#8217;s reagent (see <a href="#Page_263">p. 263</a>). If the
solution is diluted so that there is about one part of colchicine in 600

in divided doses, caused death on the fourth day. The quantity of
the active principle in the colchicum wine, as found by Johannson
(<i>Dragendorff</i>), being 0&middot;18 per cent., it follows that 24&middot;4 mgrms. (&middot;378
grain) were fatal, though not given as one dose, so that this quantity may
be considered as the least fatal one. Casper puts the lethal dose of colchicine
at from 25 to 30 mgrms. (&middot;385 to &middot;463 grain). It is, however,
incontestable that there are cases of recovery from as much as 70 mgrms.
(1&middot;08 grain). The lethal dose of the pharmaceutical preparations of
colchicum may, on these grounds, be predicted from their alkaloidal contents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
and, since the latter is not constant, in any medico-legal inquiry, it
may be necessary, where facility is given, to ascertain the strength of the

of the respiratory apparatus; the heart beats after the respiration has
ceased. Death follows from paralysis of the respiration. The mucous
membrane of the intestine is much congested and swollen.</p>

<p>I have seen cattle die from the effects of eating the meadow-saffron;
the animals rapidly lose condition, suffer great abdominal pain, and are
generally purged. The farmers, in certain parts of the country, have
had extensive losses from want of care and knowledge with regard to

Wales during the ten years ending 1892. F. A. Falck was able to collect
from medical literature, prior to 1880, 55 cases, and he gives the
following analysis of the cases:&mdash;In 2, colchicum was taken for suicidal
purposes; of the unintentional poisonings, 5 were from too large a

rheumatism; in 13 cases, colchicum was used as a purgative; 42 cases
were owing to mistaking different preparations for drinks, or cordials&mdash;the
tincture in 5, and the wine in 14, being taken instead of orange
tincture, quinine wine, schnapps or Madeira; in 1 case the corms were
added to mulled wine, in another, the leaves consumed with salad; in 16
cases (all children), the seeds of colchicum were eaten. Forty-six of

<p>In the remarkable trial at the Central Criminal Court, in 1862, of
Margaret Wilson (<i>Reg.</i> v. <i>Marg. Wilson</i>), who was convicted of the
murder of a Mrs. Somers, the evidence given rendered it fairly probable
that the prisoner had destroyed four people at different dates by colchicum.
The symptoms in all four cases were&mdash;burning pain in the throat and
stomach, intense thirst, violent vomiting and purging, coldness and clamminess
of the skin, excessive depression, and great weakness. One victim
died on the second day, another on the fifth, a third on the eighth, and
the fourth on the fourteenth day. Schroff witnessed a case in which a
man took 2 grms. (nearly 31 grains) of the corms; in one and a half hours
he experienced general <i>malaise</i>; on the next day there were flying muscular
pains, which at length were concentrated in the diaphragm, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
the breathing became oppressed; there was also pain in the neighbourhood
of the duodenum, the abdomen was inflated with gas; there was a
sickly feeling and faintness. Then came on a sleepy condition, lasting
several hours, followed by fever, with excessive pain in the head, noises
in the ears, and delirium;  there was complete recovery, but the abdomen
continued painful until the fifth day.</p>

<p>In another instance, a gentleman, aged 50,<a name="FNanchor_551" id="FNanchor_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> had taken twenty-eight of
Blair&#8217;s gout-pills in four and a half days for the relief of a rheumatic
affection. He suffered from nausea, griping pains in the belly, considerable
diarrh&#339;a, vomiting, and hiccough; towards the end there was
stupor, convulsive twitchings of the muscles, paralysis, and death. The
fatal illness lasted fourteen days; he was seen by three medical men at
different dates&mdash;the first seems to have considered the case one of diarrh&#339;a,
the second one of suppressed gout; but Dr. C. Budd was struck with the
similarity of the symptoms to those from an acrid poison, and discovered
the fact that the pills had been taken. These pills I examined; they
were excessively hard, and practically consisted of nothing else than the
finely-ground colchicum corms; six pills yielded 8 mgrms. of colchicine,
so that the whole twenty-eight would contain 39 mgrms. (<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>5</sub> grain). Dr.
Budd considered that the whole of the pills, which were of a stony hardness,
remained in the bowels for some time undigested, so that the ultimate
result was the same as if the whole had been taken in one dose.</p>

less burning pain in the whole intestinal tract, vomiting, diarrh&#339;a, with
not unfrequently bloody stools; but sometimes diarrh&#339;a is absent. In
single cases tenesmus, dysuria, and, in one case, h&aelig;maturia have been
noted. The respiration is usually troubled, the heart&#8217;s action slowed,
the pulse small and weak, and the temperature sinks. In a few cases
there have been pains in the limbs; cerebral disturbance is rare; but in
two cases (one described <i>ante</i>) there was stupor. Muscular weakness
has been observed generally. In a few cases there have been cramps in
the calves and in the foot, with early collapse and death.</p>

<p><b>Post-mortem Appearances.</b>&mdash;Schroff found in rabbits poisoned with
from &middot;1 to 1&middot;0 grm. of colchicine, tolerably constantly enteritis and
gastritis, and always a thick, pitch-like blood in the heart and veins.
Casper has carefully recorded the <i>post-mortem</i> appearances in four
labourers, ages ranging from fifteen to forty years, who, finding a bottle
of colchicum-wine, and supposing it to be some kind of brandy, each
drank a wine-glassful. They all died from its effects. In all four there
was great hyper&aelig;mia of the brain membranes and of the kidneys. The
large veins were filled with thick, dark, cherry-red blood, very similar to
that seen in sulphuric acid poisoning. There was an acid reaction of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
contents of the stomach. The lungs were moderately congested. The
mucous membrane of the stomach of the one who died first was swollen
and scarlet with congestion; with the second there was some filling of
the vessels at the small curvature; while the stomachs of the third and
fourth were quite normal. In 5 cases described by Roux there was also
hyper&aelig;mia of the brain and kidneys, but no gastritis or enteritis. It is,
therefore, evident that there are in man no constant pathological changes
from colchicine poisoning.</p>

large amount of alcohol, a few drops of <span class="chemform">HCl</span> added, and the whole
well shaken; the fluid was then filtered, and the filtrate evaporated to
a syrupy consistence at 37&deg;. The resulting residue was dissolved in
distilled water, the fat, &amp;c., filtered off, and the liquid carefully evaporated.
From the extract foreign matter was again separated by treatment
with alcohol and filtration, and the last filtrate was evaporated to a syrupy
consistence. The syrupy fluid was taken up by distilled water, filtered,
evaporated to 30 grms., and 2 grms. of calcined magnesia with 90 grms.
of ether were added. After a time, the ether was removed, and allowed
to evaporate spontaneously. The residue was once more taken up with
water, filtered from fat, &amp;c., and evaporated. This final residue gave
all the reactions of colchicine. In medico-legal researches, it must be
remembered that colchicine is absorbed but slowly, a not insignificant
portion remaining in the bowels, with the f&aelig;ces.</p>

<h4>XIII.&mdash;Muscarine and the Active Principles of Certain Fungi.</h4>

<p><a name="Sect_516" id="Sect_516"></a>&sect; 516. <b>The Amanita Muscaria</b>, or fly-blown agaric, is a very conspicuous
fungus, common in fir-plantations, about the size and shape of
the common mushroom; but the external surface of the pileus is of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
bright red, or sometimes of a yellowish cast, and studded over with
warts. The common name of the fungus denotes that it was used in
former times as a popular insecticide; the fungus was bruised, steeped
in milk, and the milk exposed, in the same way as we now expose
arsenical fly-papers.</p>

<p>Some peculiar properties of the agaric have long been known to the
natives of Kamschatka, and of the north-eastern part of Asia generally.
They collect the fungi in the hottest months, and hang them up to dry.
The fungus is then rolled up in a kind of bolus, and swallowed without
chewing. One large, or two small, fungi will produce a kind of intoxication,
which lasts a whole day. It comes on in about two hours&#8217; time,
and is very similar to that of alcohol. There is a giddy feeling, the
spirits are exalted, the countenance becomes flushed, involuntary actions
and words follow, and sometimes loss of consciousness. It renders some
persons remarkably active, and proves highly stimulant to muscular exertion;
by too large a dose violent spasmodic effects are produced. &#8220;So
very exciting to the nervous system in many individuals is this fungus,
that the effects are often very ludicrous. If a person under its influence
wishes to step over a straw or small stick, he takes a stride or a jump
sufficient to clear the trunk of a tree. A talkative person cannot keep
silence or secrets, and one fond of music is perpetually singing. The
most singular effect of the amanita is the influence which it has over the
urine. It is said that from time immemorial the inhabitants have known
that the fungus imparts an intoxicating quality to that secretion, which
continues for a considerable time after taking it. For instance, a man
moderately intoxicated to-day will, by the next morning, have slept
himself sober, but (as is the custom) by taking a teacup of his urine
he will be more powerfully intoxicated than he was the preceding day.
It is, therefore, not uncommon for confirmed drunkards to preserve their
urine as a precious liquor against a scarcity of the fungus. The intoxicating
property of the urine is capable of being propagated; for every
one who partakes of it has his urine similarly affected. Thus, with a
very few amanitas, a party of drunkards may keep up their debauch for
a week. Dr. Langsdorf mentions that by means of the second person
taking the urine of the first, the third of the second, and so on, the
intoxication may be propagated through five individuals.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_553" id="FNanchor_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a></p>

time have occurred in Europe, where it has been eaten in mistake for the
edible fungi, or taken by children allured by the bright attractive colours.
In these cases the poisonous symptoms noticed have been those of gastro-intestinal
irritation, as shown by vomiting and diarrh&#339;a, <i>dilated</i><a name="FNanchor_554" id="FNanchor_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> pupils,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>

observed. The course is usually a rapid one, the death occurring within
twelve hours. In cases of recovery, convalescence has been prolonged.</p>

<p>Muscarine is a colourless, strongly alkaline, syrupy fluid, which, if
allowed to stand over sulphuric acid, becomes gradually crystalline, but
liquefies again on exposure to the atmosphere. It dissolves in water in
every proportion, and also in alcohol, but is very little soluble in chloroform,
and insoluble in ether. It is not precipitated by tannin: it forms
salts with acids, and gives precipitates with auric chloride, phosphotungstic,
and phosphomolybdic acids, and also with potassio-mercuric
iodide. The last precipitate is at first amorphous, but it gradually
becomes crystalline. This was the compound used by the discoverers to
separate the base. With many other general alkaloidal reagents muscarine
forms no compound that is insoluble, and therefore gives no precipitate,
such, <i>e.g.</i>, as iodine with potassic iodide, picric acid, and platinic
chloride. Muscarine is a stronger base than ammonia, and precipitates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
copper and iron oxides from solutions of their salts. Muscarine is very
poisonous; 2 to 4 mgrms. are sufficient in subcutaneous injection to kill
cats in from two to twelve hours&mdash;larger doses in a few minutes; but
with rabbits the action is less intense. Cats become salivated, their
pupils contract, they vomit, and are purged, the breathing becomes
frequent, and there is marked dyspn&#339;a. At a later stage the respirations
are slower, and there are convulsions, and death.</p>

<p>The alkaloid has also been tried on man. Doses of from 3 to 5 mgrms.,
injected subcutaneously, cause, after a few minutes&#8217; profuse salivation,
increased frequency of the pulse, nausea, giddiness, confusion of thought
and myosis, but no vomiting, and no diarrh&#339;a. Small quantities applied
to the eye cause, after a few minutes, a derangement of the accommodation,
but no change in the size, of the pupil; larger quantities
cause also myosis, which depends upon an excitement of the sphincter
iridis, or of the oculomotorius.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_519" id="Sect_519"></a>&sect; 519. The actions of muscarine and atropine are to a great extent
antagonistic. This is especially and beautifully demonstrated by the
effects of the two substances on the frog&#8217;s heart. The action of muscarine
upon the heart is to excite the inhibitory nerve apparatus, while the
action of atropine is to paralyse the same system. One mgrm. of muscarine,
injected subcutaneously into a frog, arrests the heart <i>in diastole</i>,
but if a suitable dose of atropine is applied to the heart thus arrested,
it begins to beat again; or, if atropine is first given, and then muscarine,
the heart does not stop. The muscarine heart, when it has ceased to
beat, may be successfully stimulated by galvanism. Muscarine at first
excites the respiratory centre, and then paralyses it.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_520" id="Sect_520"></a>&sect; 520. <b>Detection of Muscarine in the Body.</b>&mdash;Muscarine itself is
not likely to be taken as a poison or administered; but if it is sought for
in the fly-blown agaric, or in the tissues or organs of persons who have
been poisoned by the fungus, the process of Brieger appears the best.
The process depends upon the fact that muscarine gives a soluble mercuric
chloride compound, and is not precipitated by chloride of platinum,
whilst most other substances accompanying it give more or less insoluble
precipitates. The substances are treated with water acidulated with
hydrochloric acid, and the acidulated extract concentrated (best in a
vacuum) to a syrup. The syrupy residue is now treated with water, and
the solution precipitated by means of mercuric chloride solution and any
precipitate filtered off; the filtrate is freed from mercury by <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>, and
evaporated to a syrup; the syrup is repeatedly extracted with alcohol,
and the alcoholic solution precipitated with platinum chloride and any
precipitate filtered off. The filtrate is freed from alcohol, and all the
platinum thrown out of solution by <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>; the aqueous filtrate is now concentrated
to a small volume, and again platinum chloride added, any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
precipitate which forms is filtered off, and the final filtrate allowed to
crystallise. If muscarine be present, a crystalline compound of muscarine
platinum chloride will form.</p>

<p>The crystals are usually octahedral in form, and have the composition
<span class="chemform">(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>14</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>Cl)<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>4</sub></span>; the percentage of platinum is 30&middot;41.</p>

<p>It would probably be necessary to identify farther, by the action of the
poison on a frog.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_521" id="Sect_521"></a>&sect; 521. <b>The Agaricus phalloides</b>, a common autumn fungus, has been
several times mistaken for mushrooms, and has proved fatal; of some
53 cases collected by Falck, no less than 40, or 75 per cent., were
fatal; the real mortality is much lower than this, for it is only such
cases that are pronounced and severe which are likely to be recorded.
The fungus contains a toxalbumin which has been named &#8220;phallin.&#8221;
The action of this toxalbumin is to dissolve the blood corpuscles; according
to Kobert, even one 250,000th dilution produces &#8220;polycholie,&#8221; with
all its consequences, such as the escape of h&aelig;moglobin and its decomposition
products in the blood and urine, multiple blood coagulation through
the fibrin ferment becoming free, and serious cerebral disturbance. If
into a dog, cat, or rabbit, only 0&middot;5 mgrm. of phallin be injected intravenously,
within from twenty to thirty minutes blood from a vein shows
that the serum has a red colour.</p>

<p>The symptoms in man first appear in from three to forty-eight hours;
there is mostly diarrh&#339;a, violent vomiting, with cramp in the legs,
cyanosis, and collapse. There are also nervous phenomena, convulsions,
trismus, and, in a few cases, tetanic spasms. The pulse, in seven cases
described by Maschka, was very small, thready, and quick, but in others,
again, small and slow. The pupils have in some cases been dilated, in
others unchanged. Death is generally rapid. In two of Maschka&#8217;s cases
from sixty to sixty-eight hours after the investigation, but in the rest
from twelve to eighteen hours. Life may, however, be prolonged for
several days. In a case recorded by Plowright,<a name="FNanchor_557" id="FNanchor_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> in which a boy had
eaten a piece of the pileus, death occurred on the fourth day.</p>

Hertwig found it to have no action when given to dogs.</p>

<p><b>The Agaricus ruber</b>, a bright-hued fungus, growing profusely on the
Hampshire coast, of a purple-red colour&mdash;the colouring-matter not only
covering the pileus, but also extending down the stipe&mdash;is poisonous,
and has recently been chemically investigated by Phipson,<a name="FNanchor_558" id="FNanchor_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> who has
identified a colouring-matter <i>ruberine</i>, and an alkaloid <i>agarythrine</i>.
Agarythrine is separated by macerating the fungus (from which the skin
containing the colouring-matter has been removed) as completely as possible
in water acidulated with 8 per cent. of hydrochloric acid. The
filtered solution is neutralised by sodic carbonate, and the alkaloid shaken
up with ether. On evaporation the ether leaves a white, somewhat
greasy-looking substance, having a bitter burning taste, and easily fusible
into yellow globules, giving forth an odour like quinoleine; it is soluble
in alcohol and ether. From Phipson&#8217;s observations it would appear
probable that the red colouring-matter is derived from a decomposition
of this alkaloidal substance. A rose-red colour is produced by the action
of nitric acid, and chlorinated lime first reddens and then bleaches it.
Buchwald<a name="FNanchor_559" id="FNanchor_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> has recorded three cases of poisoning by this fungus; the
patients were labourers, who, after eating the fungus, suffered from
vomiting, thirst, a &#8220;drunken&#8221; condition, cramp, albuminuria, and disturbance
of the sensory functions. The fungus causes in cats myosis,
but is said not to affect rabbits.</p>

<h4>I.&mdash;Digitalis Group.</h4>

<p><a name="Sect_526" id="Sect_526"></a>&sect; 526. <b>The Digitalis purpurea</b>, or foxglove, is a plant extremely
common in most parts of England, and poisoning may occur from the
accidental use of the root, leaves, or seeds. The seeds are very small
and pitted; they weigh 1126 to a grain (<i>Guy</i>), are of a light brown
colour, and in form somewhat egg-shaped. The leaves are large, ovate,
crenate, narrowed at the base, rugous, veined, and downy, especially on
the under surface. Their colour is a dull green, and they have a faint
odour and a bitter, nauseous taste. The leaf is best examined in section.
Its epidermis, when fresh, is seen to consist of transparent, hexagonal,
colourless cells, beneath which, either singly or in groups, there are round
cells of a magenta tint, and beneath these again a layer of columnar cells,
and near the lower surface a loose parenchyma. The hairs are simple,
appearing scantily on the upper, but profusely on the lower, surface; each
is composed of from four to five joints or cells, and has at its base a
magenta-coloured cell. The small leaves just below the seed-case, and
the latter itself, are studded with glandular hairs. The root consists of
numerous long slender fibres.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_527" id="Sect_527"></a>&sect; 527. <b>Chemical Composition.</b>&mdash;It is now generally accepted that
there exist in the foxglove, at least, four distinct principles&mdash;<i>digitalin</i>,
<i>digitonin</i>, <i>digitoxin</i>, and <i>digitalein</i>. Besides these there are several
others of more or less definite composition, which are all closely related,
and may be derived from a complex glucoside by successive removals of
hydrogen in the form of water.</p>

Like saponin, it is easily soluble in water, and the solution froths, and, like saponin
again, it is precipitated by absolute alcohol, by baryta water, and by basic lead
acetate. It may be readily distinguished from saponin by treating a watery solution
with sulphuric or hydrochloric acid. On saponifying, it is split up into digitogenin,
galactose, and dextrose. On heating, a beautiful red colour develops. It does not
give the bromine reaction.</p>

<p><b>Digitogenin</b> is insoluble in water and aqueous alkalies; it is somewhat
soluble in alcohol, chloroform, and glacial acetic acid; it forms a crystalline

hygroscopic needles, or groups of crystalline tufts; it is without smell,
but possesses a bitter taste, which is at once of slow development and of
long endurance. On warming, it becomes soft under 100&deg;, and, above
that temperature, is readily decomposed with evolution of white vapours.
It is insoluble in water, in dilute soda solution, in ether, and in benzene.
It is soluble in chloroform, especially in chloroform and alcohol, and dissolves
easily in warm acetic acid; twelve parts of cold and six of boiling
alcohol of 90 per cent. dissolve one of digitalin. Dilute hydrochloric or
sulphuric acid decompose it into glucose and digitaletin (<span class="chemform">C<sub>44</sub>H<sub>30</sub>O<sub>18</sub></span>); if
the action is prolonged, digitaleretin (<span class="chemform">C<sub>44</sub>H<sub>38</sub>O<sub>18</sub></span>), and finally dehydrated
digitaleretin, are formed. Concentrated sulphuric acid dissolves it with
the production of a green colour, which by bromine passes into violet-red,
but on the addition of water becomes green again. Hydrochloric
acid dissolves it with the production of a greyish-yellow colour, passing
gradually into emerald green; water precipitates from this solution a
resinous mass.</p>

changes to olive-green. On boiling with dilute acids, it splits up into sugar and

chloroform. On boiling with dilute acids, it is decomposed into an
amorphous, readily soluble body,&mdash;<i>Toxiresin</i>. Digitoxin, according to
Schmiedeberg, only exists in the leaves of the digitalis plant, and that
in the proportion of 1 part in 10,000. Digitalin and digitoxin are <i>par
excellence</i> the poisonous principles of the plant. Toxiresin is also
intensely poisonous. It may be obtained in crystals by extracting
the dry exhausted leaves with alcohol of 50 per cent., precipitating
with lead acetate, and washing the precipitate first with a dilute
solution of sodium carbonate (to remove colouring-matter), and then
with ether, benzene, and carbon disulphide, in all of which it is

such as the inert <i>digitin</i>, <i>digitalacrin</i>, <i>digitalein</i>, and others, but their
properties are, as yet, insufficiently studied. Digitalin, as well as
digitoxin, may now be obtained pure from certain firms, but the ordinary
digitalin of commerce is, for the most part, of two kinds, which may be
distinguished as French and German digitalin. The French digitalin,
or the digitalin of Homolle, is prepared by treating an aqueous extract
of the digitalis plant with lead acetate, and freeing the filtrate from lead,
lime, and magnesia, by successive additions of alkaline carbonate, oxalate,
and phosphate, and then precipitating with tannin. The tannin precipitate
is treated with litharge, and the digitalins boiled and extracted from
the mass by means of alcohol, and lastly, purifying with animal charcoal.
Crystals are in this way obtained, and by removing all substances soluble
in ether by that solvent, digitalin may be separated. The German digitalin
is prepared according to the process of Walz, and is extracted from
the plant by treatment with alcohol of &middot;852. The alcohol is removed by
evaporation, and the alcoholic extract taken up with water; the watery
extract is treated with lead acetate and litharge, filtered, the filtrate freed
from lead by hydric sulphate, and the excess of acid neutralised by ammonia,
and then tannin added to complete precipitation. The precipitate
is collected and rubbed with hydrated oxide of lead, and the raw digitalin
extracted by hot alcohol. The alcohol, on evaporation, leaves a mixture
of digitalin mixed with other principles and fatty matter. If sold in
this state, it may contain from 2 to 3 per cent. of digitalein and digitonin.
On treating the mixture with ether, digitalin with some digitaletin
is left behind, being almost insoluble in ether. Since, however, digitaletin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
is very insoluble in cold water, by treating the mixture with eight parts
of its weight of cold water, digitalin is dissolved out in nearly a pure
state. It may be further purified by treating the solution with animal
charcoal, recrystallisation from spirit, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_535" id="Sect_535"></a>&sect; 535. <b>Reactions of the Digitalins.</b>&mdash;Digitonin is dissolved by dilute
sulphuric acid (1&nbsp;: 3) without colour, and the same remark applies to
hydrochloric acid; on warming with either of these acids, a violet-red
colour appears; this reaction thus serves to distinguish digitonin from
the three other constituents, as well as from saponin.</p>

<p>Sulphuric and gallic acids colour the glucosides of digitalin, digitalein,
and digitonin, red, but not digitoxin, which can be identified in this
way.</p>

<p>Sulphuric acid and bromine give with digitalin a red, and with digitalein
a violet coloration, which, on the addition of water, change respectively
into emerald and light green. This, the most important chemical
test we possess, is sometimes called <i>Grandeau&#8217;s test</i>; it is not of great
delicacy, the limit being about &middot;1 mgrm.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_536" id="Sect_536"></a>&sect; 536. <b>Pharmaceutical Preparations of Digitalin.</b>&mdash;Digitalin itself
is officinal in the French, Belgium, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and
Austrian pharmacop&#339;ias. It is prepared in our own by making a strong
tincture of the leaves at 120&deg; F.; the spirit is then evaporated off, and
the extract heated with acetic acid, decolorised by animal charcoal, and
filtered. After neutralisation with ammonia, the digitalin is precipitated
with tannin, and the tannate of digitalin resolved into tannate of lead
and free digitalin, by rubbing it with oxide of lead and spirit.</p>

<p>Digitalis leaf is officinal in most of the pharmacop&#339;ias.</p>

<p>Tincture of  digitalis is officinal in our own and all the Continental
pharmacop&#339;ias, and an ethereal tincture is used in France and
Germany.</p>

<p>An <i>Acetum digitalis</i> is officinal in the Netherlands and Germany; an
extract and infusion are also used to some extent.</p>

<p>With regard to the nature of the active principle in these different
preparations, according to Dragendorff, digitonin and digitalein are most
plentiful in the acetic and aqueous preparations; whilst in the alcoholic,
digitalin, digitoxin, and digitalein are present.</p>

<p>According to Schmiedeberg, commercial digitalin contains, in addition
to digitoxin, digitonin, digitalin, and digitalein; of these, digitonin is
greatest in amount.<a name="FNanchor_562" id="FNanchor_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a></p>

<p><a name="Sect_537" id="Sect_537"></a>&sect; 537. <b>Fatal Dose.</b>&mdash;The circumstance of commercial digitalin consisting
of varying mixtures of digitoxin, digitalin, and digitalein, renders
it difficult to be dogmatic about the dose likely to destroy life. Besides,
with all heart-poisons, surprises take place; and very minute quantities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
have a fatal result when administered to persons with disease of the
heart, or to such as, owing to some constitutional peculiarity, have a
heart easily affected by toxic agents. Digitoxin, according to Kopp&#8217;s<a name="FNanchor_563" id="FNanchor_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a>
experiments, is from six to ten times stronger than digitalin or digitalein.
Two mgrms. caused intense poisonous symptoms. Digitoxin is contained
in larger proportions in Nativelle&#8217;s digitalin than in Homolle&#8217;s, or in the
German digitalin. The digitalin of Homolle is prescribed in 1 mgrm.
(&middot;015 grain) doses, and it is thought dangerous to exceed 6 mgrms.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>Lemaistre has, indeed, seen dangerous symptoms arise from 2 mgrms.
(&middot;03 grain), when administered to a boy fifteen years old. It may be
predicated from recorded cases and from experiment, that digitoxin
would probably be fatal to an adult man in doses of 4 mgrms. (<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> grain),
and digitalin, or digitalein, in doses of 20 mgrms. (&middot;3 grain). With
regard to commercial digitalin, as much as from 10 to 12 mgrms. (&middot;15 to
&middot;18 grain) have been taken without a fatal result; on the other hand,
2 mgrms. gave rise to poisonous symptoms in a woman (Battaille). Such
discrepancies are to be explained on the grounds already mentioned. It
is, however, probable that 4 mgrms. (or <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> grain) of ordinary commercial
digitalin would be very dangerous to an adult.</p>

<p>It must also, in considering the dose of digitalin, be ever remembered
that it is a cumulative poison, and that the same dose&mdash;harmless if taken
once&mdash;yet, frequently repeated, becomes deadly: this peculiarity is shared
by all poisons affecting the heart. When it is desired to settle the maximum
safe dose for the various tinctures, extracts, and infusions of
digitalis used in pharmacy, there is still greater difficulty, a difficulty
not arising merely from the varying strength of the preparations, but
also from the fact of the vomiting almost invariably excited by large
doses. Individuals swallow quantities without death resulting, simply
because the poison is rapidly expelled; whereas, if the &#339;sophagus was
ligatured (as in the experiments on the lower animals formerly favoured
by the French school of toxicologists), death must rapidly ensue. The
following table is a guide to the maximum single dose, and also the
amount safe to administer in the twenty-four hours in divided doses.
As a general rule, it may be laid down that double the maximum dose is
likely to be dangerous:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p><a name="Sect_538" id="Sect_538"></a>&sect; 538. <b>Statistics.</b>&mdash;The main knowledge which we possess of the
action of digitalis is derived from experiments on animals, and from
occasional accidents in the taking of medicines; but in comparison with
certain toxic agents more commonly known, the number of cases of
death from digitalis is very insignificant. Of 42 cases of digitalis-poisoning
collected by Husemann, 1 was criminal (murder); 1 the
result of mistaking the leaves for those of borage; 42 were caused
in medicinal use&mdash;in 33 of these last too large a dose had been
given, in 3 the drug was used as a domestic remedy, in 2 of the
cases the prescription was wrongly read, and in 1 digitalis was
used as a secret remedy. Twenty-two per cent. of the 45 were
fatal.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_539" id="Sect_539"></a>&sect; 539. <b>Effects on Man.</b>&mdash;It was first distinctly pointed out by Tardieu
that toxic doses of digitalis, or its active principles, produced not only
symptoms referable to an action on the heart, but also, in no small degree,
gastric and intestinal irritation, similar to that produced by arsenic.
Tardieu also attempted to distinguish the symptoms produced by the
pharmaceutical preparations of digitalis (the tincture, extract, &amp;c.), and
the glucoside digitalin; but there does not appear a sufficient basis for
this distinction. The symptoms vary in a considerable degree in different
persons, and are more or less tardy or rapid in their development,
according to the dose. Moderate doses continued for some time (as, for
example, in the persistent use of a digitalis medicine) may produce their
first toxic effects even at the end of many days; but when a single large
dose is taken, the symptoms are rarely delayed more than three hours.
They may commence, indeed, in half an hour, but have been known to
be retarded for more than twenty-four hours, and the longer periods may
be expected if digitalis is given in hard, not easily soluble pills. There is
commonly a feeling of general <i>malaise</i>, and then violent retching and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
vomiting. The pulse at first may be accelerated, but it soon is remarkably
slowed&mdash;it sinks commonly down to 50, to 40, and has even
been known as low as 25. To these symptoms, referable to the heart
and to the digestive tract, are added nervous troubles; there are noises
in the ears, and disturbances of vision. In a case related by Taylor, a
red-coal fire seemed to the patient to be of a blue colour; in another,
related by Lersch,<a name="FNanchor_564" id="FNanchor_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> there was blindness for eighteen hours, and for some
time a confusion in the discrimination in colours; quiet delirium has
also been noticed. As the case proceeds, the gastric symptoms also
increase in severity; the tongue Christison, in one case, noticed to be
enormously swollen, and the breath f&#339;tid. Diarrh&#339;a is commonly
present, although also sometimes absent. The action of the kidneys is
suppressed. Hiccough and convulsions close the scene.</p>

<p>In the cumulative form, the symptoms may suddenly burst out, and
the person pass into death in a fainting-fit without any warning. As a
rare effect, hemiplegia may be mentioned.</p>

<p>This brief <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of the symptoms may be further illustrated by the
following typical cases:&mdash;A recruit, aged 22, desiring to escape from military
service, went to a so-called &#8220;<i>Freimacher</i>&#8221; who gave him 100 pills, of
which he was to take eight in two doses daily. Eleven days after the
use of the pills, he became ill, and was received into hospital, where he
suddenly died after three weeks&#8217; treatment. His malady was at first
ascribed to gastric catarrh; for he suffered from loss of appetite, nausea,
and constipation. He complained of pain in the head, and giddiness.
His breath smelled badly, and the region of the stomach was painful on
pressure. The pulse was slow (56), the temperature of the body normal.
Towards the end, the pulse sank to 52; he suffered from vomiting, noise
in the ears, troubles of vision, great weakness, and later, hiccough and
swelling in the neck. The mere act of standing up in order to show his
throat caused him to faint; on the same day on which this occurrence
took place, he suddenly died on the way to the nightstool. Thirteen of
the pills were found in the patient&#8217;s clothes, and from a chemical and
microscopical examination it was found that they contained digitalis leaf
in fine powder. The quantity which the unfortunate man took in the
four weeks was estimated at 13&middot;7 grms. (= about 211 grains).</p>

<p>Two of his comrades had also been to the &#8220;<i>Freimacher</i>,&#8221; and had
suffered from the same symptoms, but they had left off the use of the
medicine before any very serious effect was produced.<a name="FNanchor_565" id="FNanchor_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a><a name="FNanchor_566" id="FNanchor_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a></p>

<p>An instructive case of poisoning by digitoxin occurred in the person of
Dr. Koppe, in the course of some experiments on the drug. He had
taken 1&middot;5 mgrm. in alcohol without result; on the following day (May 14)
he took 1 mgrm. at 9 <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span>, but again without appreciable symptoms.
Four days later he took 2 mgrms. in alcoholic solution, and an hour
afterwards felt faint and ill, with a feeling of giddiness; the pulse was
irregular, of normal frequency, 80 to 84. About three hours after taking
the digitoxin, Dr. Koppe attempted to take a walk, but the nausea,
accompanied with a feeling of weakness, became so intense that he was
obliged to return to the house. Five hours after the dose, his pulse was
58, intermittent after about every 30 to 50 beats. Vomiting set in,
the matters he threw up were of a dark green colour; after vomiting he
felt better for a quarter of an hour, then he again vomited much bilious
matter; the pulse sank to 40, and was very intermittent, stopping after
every 2 or 3 beats. Every time there was an intermission, he felt a
feeling of constriction and uneasiness in the chest. Six and a quarter
hours after the dose there was again violent vomiting and retching,
with paleness of the face. The muscular weakness was so great that he
could not go to bed without assistance. He had a disorder of vision,
so that the traits of persons well-known to him were changed, and objects
had a yellow tint. He had a sleepless night, the nausea and vomiting
continuing. During the following day the symptoms were very similar,
and the pulse intermittent, 54 per minute. He passed another restless
night, his short sleep being disturbed by terrible dreams. On the third
day he was somewhat better, the pulse was 60, but irregular and still
intermittent; the nausea was also a little abated. The night was similar
in its disturbed sleep to the preceding. He did not regain his full health
for several days.<a name="FNanchor_567" id="FNanchor_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a></p>

<p>A third case may be quoted, which differs very markedly from the preceding,
and shows what a protean aspect digitalin poisoning may assume.
A woman, twenty-three years old, took on June 26th, at 7 <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span>, for the
purpose of suicide, 16 granules of digitalin. Two hours later there was
shivering and giddiness, so that she was obliged to go to bed. In the

after eating a little food, she had a shivering fit so violent that her teeth
chattered; there was cold sweat, and difficulty in breathing; she became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
gradually again warm, but could not sleep. At 1 <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span> the difficulty of
breathing was so great that she dragged herself to the window, and
there remained until 3 <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span>, when she again went back to bed, slept
until 7 <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span>, and woke tolerably well. Since this attempt of self-destruction
had failed, she took 40 granules. After one hour she became
giddy, had hallucinations, chilliness, cold sweats, copious vomiting, and
colicky pains; there was great muscular weakness, but no diarrh&#339;a.
Towards evening the vomiting became worse. There was no action of
the bowels, nor was any urine passed; she felt as if her eyes were
prominent and large. The sufferings described lasted during the whole
night until five o&#8217;clock the following day, when the vomiting ceased,
whilst the hallucinations, chilliness, and cold sweat continued; and the
thirst, sick feeling, and weakness increased. The next morning, a physician
found her motionless in bed, with pale face, notable double exophthalmus,
dilated pupils, and cold skin, covered with sweat; the pulse was
small and intermittent, sometimes scarcely to be felt (46 to 48 per
minute); the epigastrium was painful on pressure. She passed this
second night without sleep, and in the morning the pulse had risen from
56 to 58 beats, but was not quite so intermittent. There was some
action of the bowels, but no urine was passed, nor had any been voided
from the commencement; the bladder was not distended. The following
(third) day some red-coloured, offensive urine was passed; the
skin was warmer, and the pulse from 60 to 64, still somewhat intermittent&mdash;from
this time she began to improve, and made a good
recovery.<a name="FNanchor_568" id="FNanchor_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a></p>

<p><a name="Sect_540" id="Sect_540"></a>&sect; 540. <b>Physiological Action of the Digitalins.</b>&mdash;Whatever other
physiological action this group may have, its effect on the heart&#8217;s action
is so prominent and decided, that the digitalins stand as a type of <i>heart
poisons</i>. The group of heart poisons has been much extended of late
years, and has been found to include the following:&mdash;Antiarin, an arrow
poison; helleborin, a glucoside contained in the hellebore family; a
glucoside found in the <i>Apocynace&aelig;</i>, <i>Thevatii neriifolia</i>, and <i>Thevatia
iccotli</i>; the poisonous principle of the <i>Nerium oleander</i> and <i>N. odorum</i>;
the glucoside of <i>Tanghinia venenifera</i>; convallamarin, derived from the
species of <i>Convallaria</i>; scillotoxin, from the squill; superbin, from the
Indian lily; and the alkaloid erythrophl&#339;in from the <i>Erythrophl&#339;um
judiciale</i> (see <a href="#Page_432">p. 432</a> <i>et seq.</i>). This list is yearly increasing.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_541" id="Sect_541"></a>&sect; 541. <b>Local Action.</b>&mdash;The digitalins have an exciting or stimulating
action if applied to mucous membranes&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, if laid upon the nasal
mucous surface, sneezing is excited; if applied to the eye, there is redness
of the conjunctiv&aelig; with smarting; if to the tongue, there is much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
irritation and a bitter taste. The leaves, the extract, and the tincture
all have this directly irritating action, for they all redden and inflame
mucous membranes.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_542" id="Sect_542"></a>&sect; 542. <b>Action on the Heart.</b>&mdash;The earlier experimenters on the
influence of digitalis on the heart were Stannius and Traube. Stannius<a name="FNanchor_569" id="FNanchor_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a>
experimented on cats, and found strong irregularity, and, lastly, cessation
in diastole, in which state it responded no longer to stimuli. Rabbits
and birds&mdash;especially those birds which lived on plants&mdash;were not so
susceptible, nor were frogs.</p>

<p>Traube<a name="FNanchor_570" id="FNanchor_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> made his researches on dogs, using an extract, and administering
doses which corresponded to from &middot;5 to 4&middot;0 grms. He divided the
symptoms witnessed into four stages:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<hr class="footnote" />

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p><i>1st Stage.</i>&mdash;The pulse frequently diminishes, while the pressure of the
blood rises.</p>

<p><i>2nd Stage.</i>&mdash;Not seen when large doses are employed; pulse frequency,
as well as blood pressure, abnormally low.</p>

<p><i>3rd Stage.</i>&mdash;Pressure low, pulse beats above the normal frequency.</p>

<p>The slowing of the heart<a name="FNanchor_571" id="FNanchor_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> is attributed to the stimulus of the inhibitory
nerves, but the later condition of frequency to their paralysis.
After the section of the vagi the slow pulse frequently remains, and this
is explained by the inhibitory action of the cardiac centre. The vagus,
in point of time, is paralysed earlier than the muscular substance of the
heart.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_571" id="Footnote_571"></a><a href="#FNanchor_571"><span class="label">[571]</span></a> Slowing of the pulse was mentioned first by Withering (<i>An Account
of the Foxglove</i>, Lond., 1785). Beddoes afterwards observed that
digitalis increased the force of the circulation, the slowing of the
pulse not being always observed; according to Ackermann, if the
inhibitory apparatus is affected by atropine, or if the patient is under
deep narcosis, the slowing is absent.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>The increased blood pressure Traube attributed to increased energy of
the heart&#8217;s contraction, through the motor centre being stimulated later;
the commencing paralysis explains the abnormally low pressure.</p>

<p>There is, however, also an influence on vaso-motor nerves. What Dr.
Johnson has described as the &#8220;stop-cock&#8221; action of the small arteries
comes into play, the small arteries contract and attempt, as it were, to
limit the supply of poisoned blood. Ackermann,<a name="FNanchor_572" id="FNanchor_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> indeed, witnessed
this phenomenon in a rabbit&#8217;s mesentery, distinctly seeing the arteries
contract, and the blood pressure rise after section of the spinal cord.
This observation, therefore, of Ackermann&#8217;s (together with experiments
of B&ouml;hm<a name="FNanchor_573" id="FNanchor_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> and L. Brunton<a name="FNanchor_574" id="FNanchor_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a>) somewhat modifies Traube&#8217;s explanation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
and the views generally accepted respecting the cause of the increased
blood pressure may be stated thus:&mdash;The pressure is due to prolongation
of the systolic stroke of the cardiac pump, and to the &#8220;stop-cock&#8221; action
of the arteries; in other words, there is an increase of force from behind
(<i>vis a tergo</i>), and an increased resistance in front (<i>vis a fronte</i>).</p>

other Organs.</b>&mdash;In addition to that on the heart, there are other actions
of the digitalins; for example, by whatever channel the poison is introduced,
vomiting has been observed. Even in frogs this, in a rudimentary
manner, occurs. The diuretic action which has been noticed in man
is wanting in animals, nor has a lessened diminution of urea been
confirmed.</p>

<p>Ackermann found the temperature during the period of increased
blood pressure raised superficially, but lowered internally. According to
Boeck<a name="FNanchor_575" id="FNanchor_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> there is no increase in the decomposition of the albuminoids.</p>

the effects of digitalin, made up into a thin paste with water, and applied to the
head of the common blow-fly. There are at once great signs of irritation, the
sucker is extruded to its full length, and the fly works its fore feet, attempting to
brush or remove the irritating agent. The next symptom is a difficulty in walking
up a perpendicular glass surface. This difficulty increases, but it is distinctly
observed that weakness and paralysis occur in the legs before they are seen in the
wings. Within an hour the wings become paralysed also, and the fly, if jerked from
its support, falls like a stone. The insect becomes dull and motionless, and ultimately
dies in from ten to twenty-four hours. A dose, in itself insufficient to destroy
life, does so on repetition at intervals of a couple of hours. The observation is not
without interest, inasmuch as it shows that the digitalins are toxic substances to the
muscular substance of even those life-forms which do not possess a heart.</p>

Fagge and Stevenson have shown<a name="FNanchor_576" id="FNanchor_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> that, under the influence of digitalin,
there is a peculiar form of irregularity in the beats of the heart of the
frog; the ventricle ultimately stops in the white contracted state, the
voluntary power being retained for fifteen to twenty minutes afterwards;
in very large doses there is, however, at once paralysis. Lauder Brunton<a name="FNanchor_577" id="FNanchor_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a>
considers the action on the heart to essentially consist in the
prolongation of the systole.</p>

<p>Atropine or curare have no influence on the heart thus poisoned. If
the animal under the influence of digitalin be treated with muscarine,
it stops in diastole instead of systole. On the other hand, the heart
poisoned by muscarine is relieved by digitalin, and a similar influence
appears to be exercised by atropine. The systolic stillness of the heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
is also removed by substances which paralyse the heart, as delphinin,
saponin, and apomorphin.</p>

<p>Large doses of digitalin, thrown suddenly on the circulation by intravenous
injection, cause convulsions and sudden death, from quick palsy
of the heart. With frogs under these circumstances there are no convulsions,
but a reflex depression, which, according to Weil<a name="FNanchor_578" id="FNanchor_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> and Meihuizen,<a name="FNanchor_579" id="FNanchor_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a>
disappears on decapitation. The central cerebral symptoms are without
doubt partly due to the disturbance of the circulation, and there is good
ground for attributing them also to a toxic action on the nervous substance.
The arteries are affected as well as the heart, and are reduced
in calibre; the blood pressure is also increased.<a name="FNanchor_580" id="FNanchor_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> This is essentially due
to the firm, strong contraction of the heart, and also to the &#8220;stop-cock&#8221;
action of the small arteries.<a name="FNanchor_581" id="FNanchor_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a></p>

the small arteries; but I fail to see how the small arteries can
contract, and yet not heighten the pressure.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_546" id="Sect_546"></a>&sect; 546. <b>Post-mortem Appearances.</b>&mdash;In the case of the recruit poisoned
by digitalis leaf (<a href="#Page_425">p. 425</a>), the blood was found dark and fluid; the right
ventricle and auricle of the heart were filled with blood, the left empty;
the brain and its membranes were an&aelig;mic; the stomach and mucous
membrane of the intestines were in parts ecchymosed, and there were
patches of injection. In the case of the widow De Pauw, poisoned with
digitalin by the hom&#339;opath (Conty de la Pommerais), the only abnormality
discovered was a few hyper&aelig;mic points in the mucous membrane
of the stomach and small intestines. It is then certain that although
more or less redness of the lining membrane of the intestine track may
be present, yet, on the other hand, the active principle of the digitalis
may destroy life, and leave no appreciable sign.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_547" id="Sect_547"></a>&sect; 547. <b>Separation of the Digitalins from Animal Tissues, &amp;c.</b>&mdash;It
is best to make an alcoholic extract after the method of Stas, the
alcohol being feebly acidulated by acetic acid, and all operations being
carried on at a temperature below 60&deg;. The alcoholic extract is dissolved
in water feebly acidulated by acetic acid, and shaken up, first with
petroleum ether to remove impurities (the ether will not dissolve any
of the digitalins), then with benzene, and, lastly, with chloroform. The
benzene dissolves digitalein, and the chloroform, digitalin and digitoxin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
On allowing these solvents to evaporate spontaneously, residues are
obtained which will give the reactions already detailed. Neither the
bromine nor any other chemical test is sufficient to identify the digitalins;
it is absolutely necessary to have resource to physiological
experiment. The method used by Tardieu in the classical Pommerais
case may serve as a model, more especially the experiments on frogs.
Three frogs were properly secured, the hearts exposed, and the beats
counted. The number of beats was found to be fairly equal. Frog
No. 1 was placed under such conditions that the heart was constantly
moist. Frog No. 2 was poisoned by injecting into the pleura 6 drops
of a solution in which 10 mgrms. of digitalin were dissolved in 5 c.c.
of water. The third frog was poisoned by a solution of the suspected
extract. The number of beats per minute were now counted at definite
intervals of time as follows:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In operating in this way&mdash;which is strictly comparative, and, with
care, has few sources of error&mdash;if the heart of the frog poisoned with
the unknown extract behaves in the number and irregularity of its contractions
similarly to that of the digitalin-poisoned heart, it is a fair
inference that, at all events, a &#8220;heart-poison&#8221; has been separated; but
it is, of course, open to question whether this is a digitalin or one of the
numerous groups of glucosides acting in the same way. If sufficient
quantity has been separated, chemical reactions, especially the bromine
test (Grandeau&#8217;s test), may decide, but with the larger number (yearly
increasing) of substances acting similarly on the heart, great caution in
giving an opinion will be necessary.</p>

<h5>1. CRYSTALLISABLE GLUCOSIDES.</h5>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><b>Antiarin</b> (<span class="chemform">C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>20</sub>O<sub>5</sub></span>).&mdash;Antiarin is an arrow poison obtained from the milky juice
of the <i>Antiaris toxicaria</i> growing in Java. Antiarin is obtained in crystals, by first
treating the inspissated milky juice with petroleum ether to remove fatty and other
matters, and then dissolving the active principle out with absolute alcohol. The
alcoholic extract is taken up with water, precipitated with lead acetate, filtered, and
from the filtrate antiarin obtained by freeing the solution from lead, and then
evaporating. De Vry and Ludwig obtained about 4 per cent. from the juice.
Antiarin is crystalline, the crystals containing 2 atoms of water. Its melting-point
is given as 220&middot;6&deg;; the crystals are soluble in water (254 parts cold, 27&middot;4 parts boiling),
they are not soluble in benzene, and with difficulty in ether; 1 part of antiarin
requiring 2792 parts of ether.</p>

<p>The watery solution is not precipitated by metallic salts. On warming with dilute
mineral acids, antiarin splits up into a resin and sugar. Concentrated sulphuric acid
gives with antiarin a yellow-brown solution, hydrochloric and nitric acids strike no
distinctive colours.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_549" id="Sect_549"></a>&sect; 549. <b>Effects.</b>&mdash;Antiarin is essentially a muscular and a heart poison. When
given in a sufficient dose, it kills a frog in from half an hour to an hour. Its most
marked effect is on the cardiac muscle, the heart beats more and more slowly, and at
last stops, the ventricle being firmly contracted. As with digitalin, there is a very
marked prolongation of the systole, and as with digitalin, after the beats have ceased,
a forcible dilatation of the ventricle will restore them (Schmiedeberg). It is doubtful
whether by physiological experiment antiarin could be differentiated from digitalin.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_550" id="Sect_550"></a>&sect; 550. <b>Separation of Antiarin.</b>&mdash;In any case of poisoning by antiarin, it would be
best to extract with alcohol, evaporate, dissolve the alcoholic extract in water, precipitate
with lead acetate, filter, free the filtrate from lead, and then, after alkalising
with ammonia, shake the filtrate successively with petroleum ether, benzene, and a
small quantity of ether in the manner recommended at <a href="#Page_247">page 247</a>, <i>et seq.</i> The liquid,
now freed from all fatty, resinous, and alkaloidal bodies, is neutralised and evaporated
to dryness in a vacuum, and the dry residue taken up with absolute alcohol, filtered,
the alcohol evaporated at a very low temperature, and finally the extract dissolved in
a small quantity of water, and submitted to physiological tests.</p>

</div><!--blockquote-->

<p><a name="Sect_551" id="Sect_551"></a>&sect; 551. <b>The Active Principles of the Hellebores.</b>&mdash;The Christmas
rose (<i>Helleborus niger</i>), as well as <i>H. viridis</i>, <i>H. f&#339;tidus</i>, and, in short,
all the species of hellebore, are poisonous, and if the root is treated with
alcohol, from the alcoholic extract may be separated two glucosides,
<i>helleborin</i> and <i>helleborein</i>.</p>

<p><b>Helleborin</b> is in the form of white, glittering needles, which, if placed
on the tongue, are almost tasteless, but if dissolved in alcohol, and then
tasted, give a burning, numbing sensation. By boiling with zinc chloride,
helleborin splits up into sugar and a resin&mdash;<i>helleboresin</i>. Concentrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
sulphuric acid dissolves the crystals with the production of a beautiful
red colour; on standing, the solution after a while becomes colourless,
and a white powder separates.</p>

<p><b>Helleborein</b> forms colourless crystals, mostly consisting of fine needles;
they have a bitter taste, excite sneezing, and are very hygroscopic. The
crystals easily dissolve in water and dilute alcohol, but are with difficulty
soluble in absolute alcohol, and not soluble in ether. They dissolve in
fatty oils. Helleborein splits by the action of mineral acids into sugar
and amorphous <i>helleboretin</i>.</p>

<p><b>Helleboretin</b> is in the moist condition of a beautiful violet-blue colour,
becoming, when dried at 100&deg;, dirty green. Concentrated sulphuric
acid dissolves it with the production of a brown-yellow colour, which
on standing passes into violet and then into brown.</p>

<p>Marm&eacute; separated from <i>H. f&#339;tidus</i>, in addition, a white, intensely
odorous substance, but too small in quantity to thoroughly investigate
its properties.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_552" id="Sect_552"></a>&sect; 552. There is little doubt that hellebore owes its properties to the
glucosides just described. There are several instances of poisoning by
hellebore root,<a name="FNanchor_583" id="FNanchor_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> and by the pharmaceutical preparations, but none of
poisoning by the pure active principles. Morgagni mentions a case in
which 2 grms. (nearly 31 grains) of the watery extract of <i>H. Niger</i>
caused death within eight hours; and Ferrari saw, after the use of the
wine in which the root had been boiled, two persons poisoned with a like
result. A more recent case was recorded by Felletar, in 1875, in which
a person died from an infusion of hellebore; there was, however, old
standing heart-disease, so that there may be a doubt as to the real cause
of death in this instance. Schauenstein mentions a case in which the
roots of hellebore were accidentally used in soup, but the bitter taste
prevented any quantity being eaten. The physiological action, especially
of helleborein, is that of an intense heart poison, and the symptoms
produced by the hellebores are so strikingly like those of the digitalins
that it might be difficult to distinguish clinically between them. In any
case of poisoning, the active principle must be separated in the form of
an alcoholic extract, and identified as a heart poison by physiological
experiment.</p>

animals many minutes after the heart was paralysed. (3) The striped
muscles of the body are affected, and twitches occur in them; their tonicity is
exaggerated, and finally their functional activity is destroyed. This change is
referred to an action on the muscular structure itself, independent of that upon the
heart, and also independent of the cerebro-spinal nervous system. (4) The reflex
action of the spinal cord is suspended after the heart is paralysed, but the motor

consists of resolution in alcohol, and fractional precipitation by ether. If, however,
the potass-bismuth iodide process is used, the liquid must be acidified strongly with
sulphuric acid, and the precipitate washed with diluted sulphuric acid. The precipitate
may be decomposed by baryta, filtered, and the filtrate freed from baryta by
carbon dioxide; the filtrate from this contains neriin with baric iodide; it is therefore

lay evenly on his back, and when the convulsions commenced the superior contraction
of the left side threw him on to the right, in which position he remained during
the paroxysm, after the subsidence of which he fell back into his old position. The

<p>The saponin separated from <i>Saponaria</i>, and from the corn cockle will
be here described.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_564" id="Sect_564"></a>&sect; 564. <b>Properties.</b>&mdash;Saponin is a white amorphous powder, very
soluble in water, to which it gives the curious property of frothing just
like soap solution. To obtain this effect there must be at least 1 mgrm.
in 1 c.c. of liquid. Saponin is neutral in reaction, it has no odour, but
causes sneezing if applied to the mucous membrane of the nose; the
taste is at first sweet, and then sharp and acrid. It is almost entirely
insoluble in absolute alcohol, but dissolves in hot alcohol of 83&deg; to
separate again nearly completely on cooling. It is precipitated by basic
lead acetate, and also by baryta water, but in each case it is advisable to
operate on concentrated solutions. Picric acid, mercuric chloride, and
alkaloidal &#8220;group reagents&#8221; give no precipitate. When a little of the
solid substance is treated with &#8220;Nessler&#8221; reagent, there is a greenish or
yellow colour produced. A drop of strong sulphuric acid, mixed with a
minute quantity of saponin, strikes slowly a bright red colour, which,
on heating, deepens to maroon-brown. Nordhausen sulphuric acid
shows this better and more rapidly. If saponin is boiled with dilute
acid it breaks up into sapogenin and sugar, and therefore the liquid
after neutralisation reduces &#8220;Fehling.&#8221; This reaction is probably after the
following equation:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="chemreact">2C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>26</sub>O<sub>10</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O = 2C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>11</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + 3C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>.</p>

<p>Sapogenin may be separated by evaporating the neutralised liquid to
dryness, treating the dry residue with ether, which dissolves out the
sapogenin, and finally recovering the substance from the ethereal solution,
and crystallising it from hot alcohol. Crystals are readily obtained if
the alcoholic solution is allowed to evaporate spontaneously. A solution
of saponin exposed to the air gets turbid, and develops carbon dioxide;
not unfrequently the solution becomes mouldy.</p>

on frogs. One to two drops of a saturated watery solution of saponin
applied subcutaneously to the leg, caused, in from five to six minutes,
great weakness, accompanied by a loss of sensibility; but strong mechanical,
chemical, or electrical stimuli applied to the foot excited reflex action,
for the ischiatic nerve still retained its functions. Nevertheless, from
the commencement, the excitability of the poisoned muscles was much
weakened, and just before death quite disappeared. Section of the
ischiatic nerve delayed the phenomena. Curarine did not seem to have
any effect on the poisonous action. A concentrated solution applied to
the heart of a frog soon arrests its beats, but weaker doses first excite,
and then retard.<a name="FNanchor_595" id="FNanchor_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a></p>

before death the breathing became very rapid, and there were all the signs
of asphyxia. The pathological appearances after death were fulness in

the stomach generally being perfectly normal in appearance, and the kidneys

subcutaneously to an adult, would endanger life. The symptoms
would be great muscular prostration, weakness of the heart&#8217;s action, and
probably diarrh&#339;a. In fatal cases, some signs of an irritant or inflammatory
action on the mucous membranes of the stomach and intestines
would be probable.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_567" id="Sect_567"></a>&sect; 567. <b>Separation of Saponin.</b>&mdash;Saponin is separated from bread,
flour, and similar substances by the process given at p. 153, &#8220;Foods.&#8221;
The process essentially consists in extracting with hot spirit, allowing the
saponin to separate as the spirit cools, collecting the precipitate on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
filter, drying, dissolving in cold water, and precipitating with absolute
alcohol. In operating on animal tissues, a more elaborate process is
necessary. The author has successfully proceeded as follows:&mdash;The
finely divided organ is digested in alcohol of 80 to 90 per cent. strength,
and boiled for a quarter of an hour; the alcohol is filtered hot and
allowed to cool, when a deposit forms, consisting of fatty matters, and
containing any saponin present. The deposit is filtered off, dried, and
treated with ether to remove fat. The insoluble saponin remaining
is dissolved in the least possible quantity of water, and precipitated with
absolute alcohol. It is also open to the analyst to purify it by precipitating
with baryta water, the baryta compound being subsequently decomposed
by carbon dioxide. Basic lead acetate may also be used as a
precipitant, the lead compound being, as usual, decomposed by hydric
sulphide; lastly, a watery solution may be shaken up with chloroform,
which will extract saponin. By some one of these methods, selected
according to the exigencies of the case, there will be no difficulty in
separating the glucoside in a fairly pure state. The organ best to examine
for saponin is the kidney. In one of my own experiments, in a cat
poisoned with a subcutaneous dose of saponin (&middot;2 grm.), evidence of the
glucoside was obtained from the kidney alone. The time after death at
which it is probable that saponin could be detected is unknown; it is a
substance easily decomposed, and, therefore, success in separating it from
highly putrid matters is not probable.</p>

saponin.</p>

<h3>DIVISION III.&mdash;CERTAIN POISONOUS ANHYDRIDES OF
ORGANIC ACIDS.</h3>

<hr class="sec" />

<h4>I.&mdash;Santonin.</h4>

<p><a name="Sect_569" id="Sect_569"></a>&sect; 569. Santonin (<span class="chemform">C<sub>15</sub>H<sub>18</sub>O<sub>3</sub></span>) is a neutral principle extracted from the
unexpanded heads of various species of <i>Artemisia</i> (Nat. Ord. <i>Composit&aelig;</i>).
The seeds contain, according to Dragendorff, 2&middot;03 to 2&middot;13 per cent. of
santonin, and about 2&middot;25 per cent. of volatile oil, with 3 per cent. of fat
and resin. Santonin forms brilliant, white, four-sided, flat prisms, in
taste feebly bitter. The crystals become yellow through age and exposure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
to light; they melt at 169&deg;, and are capable of being sublimed; they are
scarcely soluble in cold water, but dissolve in 250 parts of boiling water,
freely in alkaline water, in 3 parts of boiling alcohol, and in 42 parts of
boiling ether. Santonin is the anhydride of santonic acid (<span class="chemform">C<sub>15</sub>H<sub>20</sub>O<sub>4</sub></span>).
Santonin unites with alkalies to form santonates. Sodic santonate
(<span class="chemform">C<sub>15</sub>H<sub>19</sub>NaO<sub>4</sub></span> + <span class="chemform">3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</span>) is officinal on the Continent; it forms colourless
rhombic crystals, soluble in 3 parts of cold water.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_570" id="Sect_570"></a>&sect; 570. <b>Poisoning by Santonin.</b>&mdash;Eighteen cases of poisoning, either
by santonin or santonin-holding substances, which F. A. Falck has been
able to collect, were nearly all occasioned by its use as a remedy for
worms. A few were poisonings of children who had swallowed it by
accident. With one exception those poisoned were children of from two
to twelve years of age; in five the flower heads, and in thirteen santonin
itself was taken. Of the eighteen cases, two only died (about 11 per
cent.).</p>

<p><a name="Sect_571" id="Sect_571"></a>&sect; 571. <b>Fatal Dose.</b>&mdash;So small a number of children have died from
santonin, that data are not present for fixing the minimum fatal dose.
&middot;12 grm. of santonin killed a boy of five and a half years of age in fifteen
hours; a girl, ten years old, died from a quantity of flower heads, equal
to &middot;2 grm. of santonin. The maximum dose for children is from 65 to
194 mgrms. (1 to 3 grains), and twice the quantity for adults.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_572" id="Sect_572"></a>&sect; 572. <b>Effects on Animals.</b>&mdash;Experiments on animals with santonin
have been numerous. It has first an exciting action on the centres of
nerves from the second to the seventh pairs, and then follows decrease
of excitability. The medulla is later affected. There are tetanic convulsions,
and death follows through asphyxia. Artificial respiration
lessens the number and activity of the convulsions, and chloroform,
chloral hydrate, or ether, also either prevent or shorten the attacks.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_573" id="Sect_573"></a>&sect; 573. <b>Effects on Man.</b>&mdash;One of the most constant effects of santonin
is a peculiar aberration of the colour-sense, first observed by Hufeland in
1806. All things seem yellow, and this may last for twenty-four hours,
seldom longer. According to Rose, this apparent yellowness is often
preceded by a violet hue over all objects. If the lids are closed while
the &#8220;yellow sight&#8221; is present, the whole field is momentarily violet.
De Martiny,<a name="FNanchor_597" id="FNanchor_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> in a few cases, found the &#8220;yellow sight&#8221; intermit and
pass into other colours, <i>e.g.</i>, after &middot;3 grm. there was first the yellow perception,
then giving the same individual &middot;6 grm., all objects seemed
coloured red, after half an hour orange, and then again yellow. In
another patient the effect of the drug was to give &#8220;green vision,&#8221; and in
a third blue.</p>

<p>Hufner and Helmholtz explain this curious effect as a direct action on
the nervous elements of the retina, causing them to give the perception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
of violet; they are first excited, then exhausted, and the eye is &#8220;violet
blind.&#8221; On the other hand, it has been suggested that santonin either
colours the media of the eye yellow, or that there is an increase in the
pigment of the <i>macula lutea</i>. I, however, cannot comprehend how the
two last theories will account for the intermittency and the play of
colours observed in a few cases. To the affections of vision are also
often added hallucinations of taste and smell; there is headache and
giddiness, and in fourteen out of thirty of Rose&#8217;s observations vomiting
occurred. The urinary secretion is increased. In large and fatal doses
there are shivering of the body, clonic, and often tetanic convulsions;
the consciousness is lost, the skin is cool, but covered with sweat, the
pupils dilated, the breathing becomes stertorous, the heart&#8217;s action weak
and slow, and death occurs in collapse&mdash;in the case observed by Grimm
in fifteen hours, in one observed by Linstow in forty-eight hours. In
those patients who have recovered, there have also been noticed convulsions
and loss of consciousness. Sieveking<a name="FNanchor_598" id="FNanchor_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> has recorded the case of a
child who took &middot;12 grm. (1&middot;7 grain) santonin; an eruption of nettle rash
showed itself, but disappeared within an hour.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_574" id="Sect_574"></a>&sect; 574. <b>Post-mortem Appearances.</b>&mdash;The <i>post-mortem</i> appearances are
not characteristic.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_575" id="Sect_575"></a>&sect; 575. <b>Separation of Santonin from the Contents of the Stomach,
&amp;c.</b>&mdash;It is specially important to analyse the f&aelig;ces, for it has been
observed that some portion goes unchanged into the intestinal canal.
The urine, also, of persons who have taken santonin, possesses some
important peculiarities. It becomes of a peculiar yellow-green, the
colour appearing soon after the ingestion of the drug, and lasting even
sixty hours. The colour may be imitated, and therefore confused with
that which is produced by the bile acids; a similar colour is also seen
after persons have been taking rhubarb. Alkalies added to urine coloured
by santonin or rhubarb strike a red colour. If the urine thus reddened
is digested on zinc dust, santonin urine fades, rhubarb urine remains red.
Further, if the reddened urine is precipitated by excess of milk of lime
or baryta water and filtered, the filtrate from the urine reddened by
rhubarb is colourless, in that reddened by santonin the colour remains.
Santonin may be isolated by treating substances containing it with warm
alkaline water. The water may now be acidified and shaken up with
chloroform, which will dissolve out any santonin. On driving off the
chloroform, the residue should be again alkalised, dissolved in water,
and acidified with hydrochloric acid, and shaken up with chloroform.
In this way, by operating several times, it may be obtained very pure.
Santonin may be identified by its dissolving in alcoholic potash to a
transitory carmine-red, but the best reaction is to dissolve it in concentrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
sulphuric acid, to which a very little water has been added, to
warm on the water-bath, and then to add a few drops of ferric chloride
solution to the warm acid; a ring of a beautiful red colour passing into
purple surrounds each drop, and after a little time, on continuing the
heat, the purple passes into brown. A distinctive reaction is also the
production of &#8220;iso-santonin&#8221;; this substance is produced by warming
santonin on the water-bath with sulphuric acid for a few hours, and then
diluting with water; iso-santonin is precipitated, and may be crystallised
from boiling alcohol. Iso-santonin melts at 138&deg;; it has the same composition
as santonin. It is distinguished from santonin by giving no red
colour when treated with sulphuric or phosphoric acids.</p>

<h4>II.&mdash;Mezereon.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><a name="Sect_576" id="Sect_576"></a>&sect; 576. <b>The Daphne Mezereum</b> (L.).&mdash;Mezereon, an indigenous shrub belonging to
the <i>Thymeleace&aelig;</i>, is rather rare in the wild state, but very frequent in gardens. The
flowers are purple and the berries red. Buckheim isolated by means of ether an
acrid resin, which was converted by saponifying agents into <i>mezereic acid</i>; the acrid
resin is the anhydride of the acid. The resin is presumed to be the active poisonous
constituent of the plant, but the subject awaits further investigation. There are a
few cases of poisoning on record, and they have been mostly from the berries. Thus,
Linn&eacute; has recorded an instance in which a little girl died after eating twelve berries.
The symptoms observed in the recorded cases have been burning in the mouth,
gastroenteritis, vomiting, giddiness, narcosis, and convulsions, ending in death.
The lethal dose for a horse is about 30 grms. of powdered bark; for a dog, the
&#339;sophagus being tied, 12 grms.; but smaller doses of the fresh leaves may be deadly.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>The healthy grain of rye, if examined microscopically in thin sections,
is seen to be composed of the seed-coating, made up of two layers,
beneath which are the gluten-cells, whilst the great bulk of the seed
is composed of cells containing starch. In the ergotised grain, dark
(almost black) cells replace the seed-coat and the gluten-cells, whilst
the large starch-containing cells are filled with the small cells of the
fungus and numerous drops of oil.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_578" id="Sect_578"></a>&sect; 578. <b>The chemical constituents of ergot</b> are a fixed oil, trimethylamine,
certain active principles, and colouring-matters.</p>

<p>The <b>fixed oil</b> is of a brownish-yellow colour, of aromatic flavour and
acrid taste; its specific gravity is 0&middot;924, and it consists chiefly of
palmitin and olein; it has no physiological action.</p>

<p><b>Trimethylamine</b> is always present ready formed in ergot; it can also
be produced by the action of potash on ergot.</p>

<p>With regard to the <b>active principles of ergot</b> considerable confusion
still exists, and no one has hitherto isolated any single substance in such
a state of purity as to inspire confidence as to its formula or other
chemical characters. They may, however, be briefly described.</p>

<p>C. Tamet<a name="FNanchor_601" id="FNanchor_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> has separated an alkaloid, which appears identical with
Wenzel&#8217;s <i>ergotinine</i>. To obtain this the ergot is extracted by alcohol of
86&deg;, the spirit removed by distillation, and the residue cooled; a resin
(which is deposited) and a fatty layer (which floats on the surface) are
separated from the extractive liquor and washed with ether; the ethereal
solution is filtered and shaken with dilute sulphuric acid, which takes
up the alkaloid; the aqueous solution of the substance is then filtered,
rendered alkaline by <span class="chemform">KHO</span>, and agitated with chloroform. The ergotinine
is now obtained by evaporating the chloroform solution, care being
taken to protect it from contact with the air. It gives precipitates with
chloride of gold, potassium iodohydrargyrate, phosphomolybdic acid,
tannin, bromine water, and the chlorides of gold and platinum. With
moderately concentrated <span class="chemform">SO<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub></span>, it gives a yellowish-red coloration,
changing to an intense violet, a reaction which does not occur if the
alkaloid has been exposed to the air. The composition of the base is
represented by the formula <span class="chemform">C<sub>70</sub>H<sub>40</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>12</sub></span>, and a crystalline sulphate and

<p>Wenzel&#8217;s <b>Ecboline</b> is prepared by precipitating the cold watery extract
of ergot with sugar of lead, throwing out the lead in the usual way by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
hydric sulphide, concentrating the liquid, and adding mercuric chloride,
which only precipitates the ecboline. The mercury salt is now decomposed
with hydric sulphide, and after the mercury precipitate has been
filtered off, the filtrate is treated with freshly precipitated phosphate of
silver, and refiltered; lastly, the liquid is shaken up with milk of lime,
again filtered, and the lime thrown out by <span class="chemform">CO<sub>2</sub></span>. The last filtrate contains
ecboline only, and is obtained by evaporation at a gentle heat. It is an
amorphous, feebly bitter substance, with an alkaline reaction, forming
only amorphous salts.</p>

<p>The most recent research by Dragendorff on ergot tends to show that
Wenzel&#8217;s alkaloids, ergotinine and ecboline, are inactive. Dragendorff
describes also (<i>a.</i>) <i>Scleromucin</i>, a slimy substance which goes into solution
upon extraction of the ergot with water, and which is again precipitated
by 40 to 45 per cent. alcohol. It is colloidal and soluble with
difficulty in water. It contains nitrogen, but gives no albuminoid reaction,
nor any reaction of an alkaloidal or glucosidal body; it yields to

<p>(<i>b.</i>) <b>Sclerotic Acid.</b>&mdash;A feebly-acid substance, easily soluble in water
and dilute and moderately concentrated alcohol. It passes, in association
with other constituents of the ergot extract, into the diffusate, when
the extract is submitted to dialysis; but after its separation in a pure
state it is, like scleromucin, colloidal. It is precipitated by 85 to 90 per
cent. alcohol, together with lime, potash, soda, silica, and manganese;
but after maceration with hydrochloric acid, the greater part of the ash
constituents can be separated by a fresh precipitation with absolute
alcohol. The sample gave 40&middot;0 per cent. of carbon, 5&middot;2 per cent. hydrogen,
4&middot;2 per cent. nitrogen, 50.6 per cent. oxygen, with 3&middot;4 per cent. of
ash. Sclerotic acid forms with lime a compound that is not decomposed
by carbonic acid, and which upon combustion leaves from 19 to 20 per
cent. of calcium carbonate. Both these substances are active, although
evidently impure. Sclerotic acid is sold in commerce, and has been
employed subcutaneously in midwifery practice in Russia and Germany
for some time.</p>

<p>The inert principles of ergot are&mdash;(1.) A red colouring matter,
<i>Sclererythrin</i>, insoluble in water, but soluble in dilute and strong alcohol,
ether, chloroform, dilute solutions of potash, ammonia, &amp;c. It can be
obtained by dissolving in an alkali, neutralising with an acid, and shaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
up with ether. Alcoholic solution of sclererythrin gives with aluminium
sulphate, and with zinc chloride, a splendid red mixture; with salts of
calcium, barium, and many of the heavy metals, it gives a blue precipitate;
the yield is only &middot;1 to &middot;05 in a thousand parts.</p>

<p>(2.) Another colouring-matter, dissolving in concentrated sulphuric
acid with the production of a fine blue violet colour, the discoverer has
named <i>Scleroidin</i>. This is not soluble in alcohol, ether, chloroform, or
water, but dissolves in alkaline solutions, potash producing a splendid
violet colour; yield about 1 per 1000.</p>

<p>(3, 4.) Two crystalline substances, which may be obtained from ergot
powder, first treated with an aqueous solution of tartaric acid, and the
colouring-matters extracted by ether. One Dragendorff names <i>Sclerocrystallin</i>
(<span class="chemform">C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>4</sub></span>); it is in colourless needles, insoluble in alcohol and
water, with difficulty soluble in ether, but dissolving in ammonia and
potash solutions. The other crystalline substance is thought to be
merely a hydrated compound of sclerocrystallin. Both are without
physiological action.</p>

<p>Kobert recognises two active substances in ergot, and two alone; the
one he calls <i>sphacelic acid</i>, the other <i>cornutin</i>.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_579" id="Sect_579"></a>&sect; 579. <b>Detection of Ergot in Flour</b> (see &#8220;Foods&#8221;).&mdash;The best
process is to exhaust the flour with boiling alcohol. The alcoholic solution
is acidified with dilute sulphuric acid, and the coloured liquid
examined by the spectroscope in thicker or thinner layers, according to
the depth of colour. A similar alcoholic solution of ergot should be
made, and the spectrum compared. If the flour is ergotised, the solution
will be more or less red, and show two absorption bands, one in the
green, and a broader and stronger one in the blue. On mixing the
original solution with twice its volume of water, and shaking successive
portions of this liquid with ether, amyl alcohol, benzene, and chloroform,
the red colour, if derived from ergot, will impart its colour to each and
all of these solvents.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_580" id="Sect_580"></a>&sect; 580. <b>Pharmaceutical Preparations.</b>&mdash;Ergot itself is officinal in all
the pharmacop&#339;ias, and occurs in grains from <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>3</sub> to 1 inch in length, and
about the same breadth, triangular, curved, obtuse at the ends, of a
purple colour, covered with a bloom, and brittle, exhibiting a pinkish
interior, and the microscopical appearances already detailed. Ergot may
also occur as a brown powder, possessing the unmistakable odour of the
drug. A liquid extract of the B.P. is prepared by digesting 16 parts
of ergot in 80 parts of water for twelve hours, the infusion is decanted
or filtered off, and the digestion repeated with 40 parts of water; this is
also filtered off, and the residue pressed, and the whole filtrate united
and evaporated down to 11 parts; when cold, 6 parts of rectified spirit
are added, and, after standing, the liquid is filtered and made up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
measure 16. A tincture and an infusion are also officinal; the latter is
very frequently used, but seldom sold, for it is preferable to prepare it
on the spot. The tincture experience has shown to be far inferior in
power to the extract, and it is not much used. Ergotin is a purified
extract of uncertain strength; it is used for hypodermic injection; it
should be about five times more active than the liquid extract.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_581" id="Sect_581"></a>&sect; 581. <b>Dose.</b>&mdash;The main difficulties in the statement of the medicinal
dose, and of the minimum quantity which will destroy life, are the extreme
variability of different samples of ergot, and its readiness to
decompose. A full medicinal dose of ergot itself, as given to a woman
in labour, is 4 grms. (61&middot;7 grains), repeated every half hour. In this
way enormous doses may be given in some cases without much effect.
On the other hand, single doses of from 1 to 4 grms. have caused serious
poisonous symptoms. The extract and the tincture are seldom given in
larger doses than that of a drachm as a first dose, to excite uterine contraction.
In fact, the medical practitioner has in many cases to experiment
on his patient with the drug, in order to discover, not only the
individual susceptibility, but the activity of the particular preparation
used. From the experiments of Nikitin, it is probable that the least
fatal dose of sclerotic acid for an adult man is 20 mgrms. per kilogrm.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_582" id="Sect_582"></a>&sect; 582. <b>Ergotism.</b>&mdash;Ergotised cereals have played a great part in various
epidemics, probably from very early times, but the only accurate records
respecting them date from the sixteenth century. According to Dr.
Tissot,<a name="FNanchor_603" id="FNanchor_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> the first recorded epidemic was in 1596, when a strange,
spasmodic, convulsive disease broke out in Hessia and the neighbouring
regions. It was probably due to spurred rye. In Voigtl&auml;nder, the same
disease appeared in 1648, 1649, and 1675; in 1702 the whole of Freiberg
was attacked. In Germany and in France successive epidemics are
described throughout the eighteenth century. In France, in 1710, Ch.
Noel, physician at the <i>H&ocirc;tel Dieu</i>, had no less than fifty cases under
treatment at the same time.</p>

<p>It is generally said that in 1630, Thuillier, in describing an ergot

<p>It is interesting to inquire into the mortality from this disease. In
1770, in an epidemic described by Taube, in which 600 were affected,
16 per cent. died. In a nineteenth-century epidemic (1855), in which,
according to Husemann, 30 were ill, 23&middot;3 per cent. died. In other
epidemics, according to Heusinger, out of 102, 12 per cent. died;
according to Griepenkerl, out of 155, 25 or 16 per cent. died; and,
according to Meyer, of 283 cases, 6 per cent. died.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span></p>

<p>There are two forms of chronic poisoning by ergot&mdash;one a spasmodic
form, the other the gangrenous form.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_583" id="Sect_583"></a>&sect; 583. <b>The convulsive form of ergotism</b> mostly begins with some
cerebral disturbance. There are sparks before the eyes, giddiness, noises
in the ears, and a creeping feeling about the body. There is also very
commonly an&aelig;sthesia of the fingers and toes, and later of the extremities,
of the back, and even of the tongue. Diarrh&#339;a, vomiting, colic, and
other signs of intestinal irritation seldom fail to be present; there are
also tetanic spasms of the muscles, rising in some cases to well-marked
tetanus; epilepsy, faintings, aberrations of vision, amaurosis, and amblyopia
are frequent; the skin becomes of a yellow or earthy colour, and is
covered with a cold sweat; boils and other eruptions may break out;
blebs, like those caused by burns or scalds, have in a few cases been
noticed. Death may occur in from four to twelve weeks after the eating
of the spurred grain from exhaustion. In those individuals who recover,
there remain for some time weakness, contractions of groups of muscles,
an&aelig;mia, or affections of vision.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_584" id="Sect_584"></a>&sect; 584. <b>The Gangrenous Form of Ergotism.</b>&mdash;In this form there is
generally acute pain in the limb or limbs which are to mortify; and
there may be prodromata, similar to those already described. The limb
swells, is covered with an erysipelatous blush, but at the same time feels
icy cold; the gangrene is generally dry, occasionally moist; the mummified
parts separate from the healthy by a moist, ulcerative process;
and in this way the toes, fingers, legs, and even the nose, may be lost.
During the process of separation there is some fever, and py&aelig;mia may
occur with a fatal result.</p>

<p>Fontenelle described a case in which a rustic lost all the toes of one
foot, then those of the other; after that, the remnant of the first foot,
and lastly the leg. But probably the most extraordinary case of gangrene
caused by the use of ergot is that which occurred at Wattisham, Suffolk,
in the family of a labouring man named John Downing. He had a wife
and six children of various ages, from fifteen years to four months. On
Monday, January 10, 1762, the eldest girl complained of a pain in the
calf of her left leg; in the evening, her sister, aged 10, also experienced
the same symptoms. On the following Monday, the mother and another
child, and on Tuesday, all the rest of the family except the father became
affected. The pain was very violent. The baby at the breast lived a few
weeks, and died of mortification of the extremities. The limbs of the
family now began to slough off, and the following are the notes on their
condition made by an observer, Dr. C. Wollaston, F.R.S., on April
13:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;The mother, aged 40. Right foot off at the ankle, the left leg
mortified; a mere bone left, but not off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Elizabeth, aged 13. Both legs off below the knees.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sarah, aged 10. One foot off at the ankle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Robert, aged 8. Both legs off below the knees.</p>

<p>&#8220;Richard, aged 4. Both feet off at the ankle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Infant, four months old, dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>The father was also attacked a fortnight after the rest of the family,
and in a slighter degree&mdash;the pain being confined to the fingers of his
right hand, which turned a blackish colour, and were withered for some
time, but ultimately got better.</p>

<p>As a remarkable fact, it is specially noted that the family were in
other respects well. They ate heartily, and slept soundly when the pain
began to abate. The mother looked emaciated. &#8220;The poor boy in
particular looked as healthy and florid as possible, and was sitting on
the bed, quite jolly, drumming with his stumps.&#8221; They lived as the
country people at the time usually lived, on dried peas, pickled pork,
bread and cheese, milk, and small beer. Dr. Wollaston strictly examined
the corn with which they made the bread, and he found it
&#8220;very bad; it was wheat that had been cut in a rainy season, and had
lain in the ground till many of the grains were black and totally
decayed.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_604" id="FNanchor_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a></p>

<p><a name="Sect_586" id="Sect_586"></a>&sect; 586. <b>Physiological Action as shown by Experiments on Animals.</b>&mdash;In
spite of numerous experiments on animals and man, the action of the
ergot principles remains obscure. It has been found in medicine to exert
a specific action on the uterus,<a name="FNanchor_606" id="FNanchor_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> causing powerful contractions of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
organ, especially in labour. It is also a h&aelig;mostatic, and is used to check
bleeding from the lungs and other internal organs of the body. This
h&aelig;mostatic action, as well as the extraordinary property possessed by
ergot, of producing an arrest or disturbance of the circulation inducing
gangrene has naturally led to the belief that ergot causes a narrowing in
the calibre of the small arteries, but this has not received the necessary
experimental sanction. Holmes,<a name="FNanchor_607" id="FNanchor_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> Eberty, K&ouml;hler,<a name="FNanchor_608" id="FNanchor_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> and Wernick,<a name="FNanchor_609" id="FNanchor_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> all
observed a contraction in the part to which the ergot was applied, both
in frogs and in warm-blooded animals; but L. Hermann,<a name="FNanchor_610" id="FNanchor_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> although he
made many experiments, and used the most different preparations, never
succeeded in observing a contraction. It would also seem reasonable
to expect that with a narrowing of the vessels, which means a peripheral
obstruction, the blood-pressure would rise, but on the contrary the pressure
sinks, a fact on which there is no division of opinion.</p>

the treatment of amenorrh&#339;a, and other uterine affections. Although

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>Nikitin has made some researches with pure sclerotic acid, which
certainly possesses the most prominent therapeutic effects of ergot; but
since it is not the only <i>toxic</i> substance, it may not represent the collective
action of the drug, just in the same way that morphine is not equivalent
in action to opium. Cold-blooded animals are very sensitive to
sclerotic acid; of the warm-blooded the carnivor&aelig; are more sensitive than
the herbivor&aelig;. The toxic action is specially directed to the central
nervous system&mdash;with frogs, the reflex excitability is diminished to full
paralysis; with warm-blooded animals reflex excitability is only diminished,
and continues to exist even to death.</p>

<p>The temperature falls, the breathing is slowed, and the respiration
stops before the heart ceases to beat; the peristaltic action of the intestines
is quickened, and the uterus (even of non-pregnant animals) is
thrown into contraction. The terminations of the sensory nerves are
paralysed by the direct action of sclerotic acid, but they remain intact
with general poisoning. The heart of frogs is slowed by sclerotic acid.
Eberty observed that this slowing of the heart (he used ergotin) was
produced even after destruction of the spinal cord; he therefore considered
it as acting on the inhibitory nerve apparatus of the heart itself.
Rossbach, using Wenzel&#8217;s ecbolin, has also studied its action on the
heart of the frog, and observed that the slowing affected the ventricles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
rather than the auricles, so that for one ventricle-systole there were two
contractions of the auricles; besides which, the contractions themselves
were peculiar and abnormal in character. The cause of death from
sclerotic acid seems to be paralysis of the respiration. It is said not to
affect animal f&#339;tal life. With regard to the effects produced by feeding
animals with ergotised grain, experiments made during the last century
have proved that it produces a gangrenous disease, <i>e.g.</i>, C. Salern&eacute; mixed
one part of spurred rye with two of good barley, and fed pigs with the
mixture; a few days afterwards the pigs perished with dilated, hard,
and black bellies, and offensively ulcerated legs; another pig fed entirely
on the rye, lost its four feet and both ears.</p>

<p>Kobert<a name="FNanchor_611" id="FNanchor_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> has investigated the effects produced on animals by &#8220;sphacelic
acid,&#8221; and by &#8220;cornutin.&#8221; Sphacelic acid appears to cause gangrene,
like ergot, and Kobert believes that in &#8220;sphacelic acid&#8221; is to be found
the gangrene-producing substance. In cases of death putrefaction is
rapid, the mucous membrane of the intestine is swollen, and the spleen
enlarged. If the mucous membrane of the intestine is examined microscopically,
a large quantity of micro-organisms are found in the vessels,
in the villi, between the muscular bundles and in the deeper layers of
the intestinal walls; this is evidence that the protective epithelial cells
have been destroyed. The mesentery of cats, pigs, and fowls, contains
numerous small extravasations of blood. The organs generally, and
especially the subcutaneous cellular tissue, are tinged with the colouring
matters of the bile; this Kobert considers as evidence of weakened vitality
of the red blood corpuscles. The walls of the blood-vessels show hyaline
degeneration, and give with iodine a quasi-amyloid reaction. The vessels
are often partly filled with a hyaline mass, in which, at a later date, a fine
black pigment appears. These pigmented hyaline masses probably
occlude the vessels, and hence cause gangrene.</p>

<p>Cornutin, according to Kobert, first excites the vagus; consequently
there is slow pulse and heightened blood pressure; then it paralyses the
vaso-motor centre, and the pulse is accelerated. Severe convulsions,
preceded by formication, follow. Paralysis of the extensor muscles, with
permanent deformity, may result. Cornutin stimulates the uterus to
contraction, but it does not act so well in this respect alone as when
given with sphacelic acid. In animals poisoned with cornutin, no special
pathological changes of a distinctive nature have been described.</p>

<h4>II.&mdash;Picrotoxin, the Active Principle of the Cocculus
indicus (Indian Berry, Levant Nut).</h4>

<p><a name="Sect_588" id="Sect_588"></a>&sect; 588. The berries of the <i>Menispermum cocculus</i> comprise at least three
definite crystalline principles: <i>menispermine</i>,<a name="FNanchor_612" id="FNanchor_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> <i>paramenispermine</i> (nitrogen
containing bases), and <i>picrotoxin</i>, which possesses some of the
characters of an acid.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_612" id="Footnote_612"></a><a href="#FNanchor_612"><span class="label">[612]</span></a> <i>Menispermine</i> (<span class="chemform">C<sub class="tab">18</sub>H<sub class="tab">24</sub>N<sub class="tab">2</sub>O<sub class="tab">2</sub></span>?), discovered in 1834 by
Pelletier and Courbe, is associated with a second named
<i>paramenispermine</i>. The powdered berries are extracted by alcohol of
36&deg;; the picrotoxin removed by hot water from the alcoholic extract; the
menispermine and paramenispermine dissolved out together by acidulated
water, and from this solution precipitated by ammonia. The brown
precipitate is dissolved by acetic acid, filtered, and again
precipitated by ammonia. This precipitate is dried, treated with cold
alcohol, to separate a yellow resinous substance, and lastly with ether,
which dissolves out the menispermine, but leaves the paramenispermine.</p>

<p>Menispermine forms white semi-transparent, four-sided, truncated prisms,
melting at 120&deg;, decomposed at a higher temperature, insoluble in water,
but dissolving in warm alcohol and ether. Combined with 8 atoms of water
it crystallises in needles and prisms. The crystals are without any
taste; in combination with acids, salts may be formed.</p>

<p><i>Paramenispermine</i> forms four-sided prisms, or radiating crystalline
masses, melting at 250&deg;, and subliming undecomposed. The crystals are
soluble in absolute ether, insoluble in water, and scarcely soluble in
ether.</p>

<p><i>Paramenispermine</i> dissolves in acids, but apparently without forming
definite salts.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_589" id="Sect_589"></a>&sect; 589. <b>Picrotoxin</b> (<span class="chemform">C<sub>30</sub>H<sub>34</sub>O<sub>13</sub></span>) was discovered in 1820 by Boullay. It
is usually prepared by extracting the berries with boiling alcohol, distilling
the alcohol off, boiling the alcoholic residue with a large quantity
of water, purifying the watery extract with sugar of lead, concentrating
the colourless filtrate by evaporation, and crystallising the picrotoxin out
of water.</p>

<p>Picrotoxin crystallises out of water, and also out of alcohol, in colourless,
flexible, four-sided prisms, often arborescent, and possessing a silky
lustre. They are unalterable in the air, soluble in 150 parts of cold, and
25 parts of boiling water, dissolving easily in acidified water, in spirit, in
ether, in amyl alcohol, and chloroform. They are without smell, but
have an extremely bitter taste. Caustic ammonia is also a solvent.</p>

<p>The crystals are neutral in reaction. They melt at 192&deg;-200&deg; C. to a
yellow mass; at higher temperatures giving off an acid vapour, with a
caramel-like odour, and lastly carbonising. Picrotoxin in cold concentrated
sulphuric acid dissolves with the production of a beautiful gold-yellow
to saffron-yellow colour, which becomes on the addition of a trace
of potassic bichromate, violet passing into brown. An alcoholic solution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>turns a ray of polarised light to the left [&#945;]<sub>D</sub> = -28&middot;1&deg;.</p>

<p>Picrotoxin behaves towards strong bases like a weak acid. Its compounds
with the alkalies and alkaline earths are gummy and not
easily obtained pure. Compounds with quinine, cinchonine, morphine,
strychnine, and brucine can be obtained in the crystalline condition.
Dilute sulphuric acid transforms it, with assimilation of water, into a
weak gummy-like acid, which corresponds to the formula <span class="chemform">C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>16</sub>O<sub>6</sub></span>.
Nitric acid oxidises it to oxalic acid. Nitropicrotoxin and bromopicrotoxin,
<span class="chemform">C<sub>30</sub>H<sub>33</sub>(NO<sub>2</sub>)O<sub>13</sub></span>, and <span class="chemform">C<sub>30</sub>H<sub>32</sub>Br<sub>2</sub>O<sub>13</sub></span>, can by appropriate
treatment be obtained.</p>

<p>Concentrated aqueous solutions of alkalies and ammonia decompose
picrotoxin fully on warming. It reduces alkaline copper solution, and
colours bichromate of potash a beautiful green. The best test for its
presence is, however, as follows:&mdash;The supposed picrotoxin is carefully
dried, and mixed with thrice its bulk of saltpetre, the mixture moistened
with sulphuric acid, and then decomposed with soda-lye in excess, when
there is produced a transitory brick-red colour. For the reaction to
succeed, the picrotoxin should be tolerably pure.</p>

<p>Solutions of picrotoxin are not precipitated by the chlorides of
platinum, mercury, and gold, iodide of potassium, ferro- and ferri-cyanides
of potassium, nor by picric nor tannic acids.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_590" id="Sect_590"></a>&sect; 590. <b>Fatal Dose.</b>&mdash;Vossler killed a cat in two hours with a dose of
&middot;12 grm. (1&middot;8 grain); and another cat, with the same dose, died in 45
minutes. Falck destroyed a young hound with &middot;06 grm. (&middot;92 grain)
in 24 to 26 minutes. Given by subcutaneous or intravenous injection,
it is, as might be expected, still more lethal and rapid in its effects. In
an experiment of Falck&#8217;s, &middot;03 grm. (&middot;46 grain), injected into a vein,
destroyed a strong hound within 20 minutes; &middot;016 grm. (&middot;24 grain)
injected under the skin, killed a guinea-pig in 22 minutes; and &middot;012
grm. (&middot;18 grain) a hare in 40 minutes. Hence it may be inferred that
from 2 to 3 grains (12&middot;9 to 19&middot;4 centigrms.) would in all probability, be
a dangerous dose for an adult person.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_591" id="Sect_591"></a>&sect; 591. <b>Effects on Animals.</b>&mdash;The toxic action of picrotoxin on fish
and frogs has been proposed as a test. The symptoms observed in fish
are mainly as follows:&mdash;The fish, according to the dose, show uncertain
motions of the body, lose their balance, and finally float to the surface,
lying on one side, with frequent opening of the mouth and gill-covers.
These symptoms are, however, in no way distinguishable from those
induced by any poisonous substance in the water, or by many diseases
to which fish are liable. Nevertheless, it may be conceded that in certain
cases the test may be valuable&mdash;if, <i>e.g.</i>, beer be the matter of research,
none of the methods used for the extraction of picrotoxin will be likely
to extract any other substance having the poisonous action described on
fish, so that, as a confirmatory test, this may be of use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span></p>

<p>Frogs, under the influence of picrotoxin, become first uneasy and restless,
and then somewhat somnolent; but after a short time tetanic convulsions
set in, which might lead the inexperienced to imagine that the
animal was poisoned by strychnine. There is, however, one marked
distinction between the two&mdash;viz., that in picrotoxin poisoning an
extraordinary swelling of the abdomen has been observed, a symptom
which, so far as known, is due to picrotoxin alone. The frog is, therefore,
in this instance, the most suitable object for physiological tests.</p>

<p>Beer extract containing picrotoxin is fatal to flies; but no definite
conclusion can be drawn from this, since many bitter principles (notably
quassia) are in a similar manner fatal to insect life.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_592" id="Sect_592"></a>&sect; 592. <b>Effects on Man.</b>&mdash;Only two fatal cases of poisoning by picrotoxin
are on record. In 1829 several men suffered from drinking rum
which had been impregnated with <i>Cocculus indicus</i>; one died, the rest
recovered. In the second case, a boy, aged 12, swallowed some of a
composition which was used for poisoning fish, the active principle of
which was <i>Cocculus indicus</i>; in a few minutes the boy experienced a
burning taste, he had pains in the gullet and stomach, with frequent
vomiting, and diarrh&#339;a. A violent attack of gastro-enteritis supervened,
with fever and delirium; he died on the nineteenth day. The <i>post-mortem</i>
signs were those usual in peritonitis: the stomach was discoloured,
and its coats thinner and softer than was natural; there were also other
changes, but it is obvious that, as the death took place so long after the
event, any pathological signs found are scarcely a guide for future
cases.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_593" id="Sect_593"></a>&sect; 593. <b>Physiological Action.</b>&mdash;The convulsions are considered to arise
from an excitation of the medulla oblongata; the vagus centre is stimulated,
and causes spasm of the glottis and slowing of the heart&#8217;s action
during the attack. R&ouml;hrig also saw strong contraction of the uterus produced
by <i>picrotoxin</i>. According to the researches of Crichton Browne,
<i>chloral hydrate</i> acts in antagonism to picrotoxin, and prevents the convulsions
in animals if the dose of picrotoxin is not too large.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_594" id="Sect_594"></a>&sect; 594. <b>Separation from Organic Matters.</b>&mdash;Picrotoxin is extracted
from aqueous acid solutions by either chloroform, amyl alcohol, or ether;
the first is the most convenient. Benzene does not extract it, if employed
in the same manner. On evaporation of the solvent the crude picrotoxin
can be crystallised out of water, and its properties examined.</p>

<p>R. Palm<a name="FNanchor_613" id="FNanchor_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> has taken advantage of the fact that picrotoxin forms a stable
compound with freshly precipitated lead hydroxide, by applying this
property as follows:&mdash;the solution supposed to contain picrotoxin is evaporated
to dryness, and the extract then taken up in a very little water,
acidified and shaken out with ether. The ether is evaporated, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
ethereal extract dissolved in a little water, the aqueous solution filtered
through animal charcoal, and precipitated by means of lead acetate, avoiding
excess. The solution is filtered and shaken with freshly prepared lead
hydroxide. The lead hydroxide is dried and tested direct for picrotoxin;
if it does contain picrotoxin then on adding to it concentrated <span class="chemform">H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub></span>
a beautiful saffron yellow is produced as bright as if the substance was
pure picrotoxin.</p>

<h4>III.&mdash;The Poison of Illicium Religiosum&mdash;A Japanese Plant.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><a name="Sect_595" id="Sect_595"></a>&sect; 595. A new poison belonging to the picrotoxin class has been described by Dr.
A. Langaard. In 1880, 5 children in Japan were poisoned by the seeds of the
<i>Illicium religiosum</i>; 3 of the children died. Dr. Langaard then made various experiments
on animals with an active extract prepared by exhaustion with spirit, and
ultimate solution of the extract in water. Eykmann has also imperfectly examined
the chemistry of the plant, and has succeeded in isolating a crystalline body which
is not a glucoside; it is soluble in hot water, in chloroform, ether, alcohol, and
acetic acid, but it is insoluble in petroleum ether; it melts at 175&deg;, and above that
temperature gives an oily sublimate. Langaard&#8217;s conclusions are that all parts of
the plant are poisonous. The poison produces excitation of the central apparatus of
the medulla oblongata and clonic convulsions analogous to those produced by picrotoxin,
toxiresin, and cicutoxin. Before the occurrence of convulsions, the reflex excitability
of frogs is diminished, the respiratory centre is stimulated, hence frequency
of the respiration. Small doses cause slowing of the pulse through stimulation of the

activity is later diminished. Small doses kill by paralysing the respiratory centre,
large by heart paralysis. The proper treatment seems to be by chloral hydrate, for
when animals are poisoned by small lethal doses it appears to save life, although
when the dose is large it has no effect.&mdash;<i>Ueber die Giftwirkung von Japanischem

<h4>IV.&mdash;Picric Acid and Picrates.</h4>

<p><a name="Sect_596" id="Sect_596"></a>&sect; 596. <b>Picric Acid</b>, <span class="chemform">C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>3</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub></span>, or
<span class="structform"><img src="images/illo489.png" alt="" width="86" height="50" /></span> is trinitrophenol; it
forms a number of salts, all of which are more or less poisonous. Picric
acid is much used in the arts, especially as a dye. The pure substance
is in the form of pale yellow crystals, not very soluble in cold water, but
readily soluble in hot water, and readily soluble in benzene, ether, and petroleum
ether. The solution is yellow, tastes bitter, and dyes animal fibres,
such as wool; but it can be washed out of plant fibres such as cotton.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_597" id="Sect_597"></a>&sect; 597. <b>Effects of Picric Acid.</b>&mdash;Picric acid and its salts have a tendency
to decompose the elements of the blood, and to produce meth&aelig;moglobin;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
picric acid is also an excitor of the nervous system, producing
convulsions. To these two effects must be added a third; in acid solution
it has a strong affinity for albumin, so that if it meets with an acid
tissue it combines with the tissue, and in this way local necroses are set
up. The action on albumin is somewhat weakened by the reduction in
the body of part of the picric acid to picraminic acid <span class="chemform">C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>2</sub>(NO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>OH</span>,
a substance that does not so readily form compounds with albuminous
matters. Doses of 0&middot;5 to 0&middot;9 grm. (about 8 to 14 grains) may be taken
several days in succession without marked symptoms. Ultimately, however,
what is known as &#8220;picric jaundice&#8221; appears, the conjunctiva and
the whole skin being stained more or less yellow. The urine, at first of a
dark yellow, is later of a red brown colour. Dyspepsia, with flatulence and
an inclination to diarrh&#339;a have been noticed. A single dose of a gramme
(15&middot;4 grains) caused in a case described by Adler<a name="FNanchor_614" id="FNanchor_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> pain in the stomach,
headache, weakness, diarrh&#339;a, vomiting of yellow matters, quickening
and afterwards slowing of the pulse; the skin was of a brown yellow
colour, and there were nervous symptoms. The urine was ruby red. In
both f&aelig;ces and urine picric acid could be recognised. The excretion of
picric acid continued for six days. A microscopical examination of the
blood showed a diminution of the red blood corpuscles, an increase in
the white. Ch&eacute;ron<a name="FNanchor_615" id="FNanchor_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> has described a case in which the application of
0&middot;45 grm. (6&middot;9 grains) to the vagina produced yellowness of the skin in
an hour, and the urine was also coloured red. Erythema, somnolence,
burning and smarting in the stomach and in the kidneys were also
noticed.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_598" id="Sect_598"></a>&sect; 598. <b>Tests.</b>&mdash;Picric acid is easily separated from either tissues or
other organic matters. These are acidified with sulphuric acid and then
treated with 95 per cent. alcohol; the alcohol is filtered off, distilled,
and the residue treated with ether; this last ethereal extract will contain
any picric acid that may be present.</p>

<p>If the ether extract contains much impurity, it may be necessary to
drive off the ether, and to take up the residue with a little warm water,
then to cool, filter through a moistened filter paper, and test the aqueous
solution. Picric acid, warmed with <span class="chemform">KCN</span> and <span class="chemform">KHO</span> gives a blood-red
colour, from the production of iso-purpurate of potash. Ammoniacal copper
sulphate forms with picric acid yellow-green crystals which strongly
refract the light. If a solution of picric acid be reduced by the addition
of a hydrochloric acid solution of stannous chloride, the subsequent
addition of ferric chloride produces a blue colour, due to the formation
of amidoimidophenol hydrochloride <span class="chemform">C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>2</sub>OH(NH<sub>2</sub>)(NH)<sub>2</sub>HCl</span>.</p>

<h4>V.&mdash;Cicutoxin.</h4>

<p><a name="Sect_599" id="Sect_599"></a>&sect; 599. The <i>Cicuta virosa</i>, a not very common umbelliferous plant
growing in moist places, is extremely poisonous. It is from 3 to 4 feet
in height, with white flowers; the umbels are large, the leaves are tripartite,
the leaflets linear lanceolate acute, serrate decurrent; the calyx
has five leaf-like teeth, the petals are obcordate with an inflex point;
the carpels have five equal broad flattened ridges with solitary stripes.
B&ouml;hm<a name="FNanchor_616" id="FNanchor_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> succeeded, in 1876, in separating an active principle from this
plant. The root was dried, powdered, and exhausted with ether; on
evaporation of the ether the extract was taken up with alcohol, and after
several days standing the filtrate was treated with petroleum ether; after
removing the petroleum, the solution was evaporated to dryness in a
vacuum; it was found to be a resinous mass, to which was given the
name <i>cicutoxin</i>. It was fully soluble in alcohol, ether, or chloroform,
and was very poisonous, but what its exact chemical nature may be is
still unknown.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_600" id="Sect_600"></a>&sect; 600. <b>Effects on Animals.</b>&mdash;Subcutaneously injected into frogs, cicutoxin
acts something like picrotoxin, and something like the barium compounds.
Ten to fifteen minutes after the injection the animal assumes a
peculiar posture, holding the legs so that the thigh is stretched out far
from the trunk, and the leg at right angles with the thigh; voluntary
motion is only induced by the strongest stimuli, and when the frog
springs, he falls down plump with stiffly stretched-out limbs. The
frequency of breathing is increased, the muscles of the abdomen are
thrown into contraction, and the lungs being full of air, on mechanical
irritation there is a peculiar loud cry, depending upon the air being forced
under the conditions detailed through the narrow glottis. Tetanic convulsions
follow, gradually paresis of the extremities appears, and, lastly,
full paralysis and death; these symptoms are seen after doses of from 1
to 2 mgrms. The lethal dose for cats is about 1 centigrm. per kilo.
Diarrh&#339;a, salivation, and frequent breathing are first seen, and are
followed by tonic and clonic convulsions, then there is an interval, during
which there is heightened excitability of reflex action, so that noises will
excite convulsions. Small doses by exciting the vagus slow the pulse;
larger doses quicken the pulse, and raise the arterial pressure. Cicutoxin
is supposed to act specially on the medulla oblongata, while the spinal
cord and the brain are only secondarily affected.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_601" id="Sect_601"></a>&sect; 601. <b>Effects on Man.</b>&mdash;F. A. Falck was able to collect thirty-one
cases of poisoning by cicuta; of these 14 or 45&middot;2 per cent. died. The
symptoms are not dissimilar to those described in animals. There are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
pain and burning in the stomach, nausea, vomiting, headache, and then
tetanic convulsions. These, in some cases, are very severe, and resemble
those induced by strychnine; but in a few cases there is early coma
without convulsions. There is also difficulty or absolute impossibility
of swallowing. In fatal cases the respiration becomes stertorous, the
pulse small, the pupils dilated, and the face cyanotic, and death occurs
within some four hours, and in a few cases later. The <i>fatal dose</i> is
unknown.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_602" id="Sect_602"></a>&sect; 602. <b>Separation of Cicutoxin from the Body.</b>&mdash;An attempt might
be made to extract cicutoxin from the tissues on the same principles as
those by which it has been separated from the plant, and identified by
physiological experiments. In all recorded cases, identification has been
neither by chemical nor physiological aids, but by the recognition of
portions of the plant.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_603" id="Sect_603"></a>&sect; 603. This plant has long been considered poisonous, and a number
of cases are on record in which it is alleged that death or illness resulted
from its use. Dr. John Harley,<a name="FNanchor_617" id="FNanchor_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> however, in an elaborate paper, has
satisfactorily proved the innocence of this plant, and has analysed the
cases on record. He has experimented on himself, on animals, and on
men, with the expressed juice and with the tincture. The results were
entirely negative: some of the published cases he refers to conium, and
others to aconite.</p>

indigenous to England, and growing in moist places such as ditches, &amp;c.,
is in flower in the month of August. It resembles somewhat celery, and
the root is something like the parsnip, for which it has been eaten. All
parts of the plant are said to be poisonous, but the leaves and stalks only
slightly so, while the root is very deadly. We unfortunately know nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
whatever about the active principles of the plant, its chemistry has yet to
be worked out. M. Toulmouche (<i>Gaz. M&eacute;d.</i>, 1846) has recorded, as the
expert employed in the case, an attempt to murder by using the <i>&#339;nanthe</i>
as a poison; a woman scraped the root into her husband&#8217;s soup with evil
intent, but the taste was unpleasant, and led to the detection of the crime.
The root has been mistaken several times for parsnip and other edible
roots, and has thus led to poisonings. The case of 36 soldiers poisoned
in this way, in 1758, has been recorded by Orfila; there was one death.
In 1803 three soldiers were poisoned at Brest&mdash;1 died. In Woolwich
Bossey witnessed the poisoning of 21 convicts who ate the roots and
leaves of the plant&mdash;6 died. In 1858 there were several sailors poisoned
in a similar way&mdash;2 died; while there have been numerous cases in which
the plant has been partaken of by children.</p>

which occurred in 1882 at Plymouth; a Greek sailor, aged thirty,
found on the coast what he considered &#8220;wild celery,&#8221; and ate part of the
root and some of the stem. Two hours after this he ate a good meal and
felt perfectly well, but fifteen minutes later he suddenly and violently
vomited; the whole contents of the stomach were completely evacuated.
In five minutes he was completely unconscious, and had muscular twitchings
about the limbs and face. There was a copious flow of a thick
tenacious mucus from the mouth which hung about the lips and clothing
in viscid strings. Twenty-four hours after the poisoning he was admitted
into the South Devon Hospital apparently semi-comatose; his legs dragged,
and he had only feeble control of them; the extremities were cold, but
there was general free sweating. He could be roused only with difficulty.
There were no spasms, the pupils were dilated and sluggish, the respiration
only 14 per minute. Twelve hours after admission he became warmer,
and perspired freely; he slept continuously, but could easily be roused.
On the following day he was quite conscious, and made a good recovery.
Two companions who had also eaten a smaller quantity of the hemlock
dropwort, escaped with some numbing sensations, and imperfect control
over the extremities. In the Woolwich cases the symptoms seem to
have been something similar; in about twenty minutes, one man, without
any apparent warning, fell down in strong convulsions, which soon ceased,
although he looked wild; a little while afterwards his face became bloated
and livid, his breathing stertorous and convulsive, and he died in five
minutes after the first symptoms had set in. A second died with similar
symptoms in a quarter of an hour; a third died in about an hour, a fourth
in a little more than an hour; two other cases also proved fatal, one in
nine days, the other in eleven. In the two last cases there were signs of
intestinal irritation. The majority of the others fell down in a state of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
insensibility with convulsions, the after-symptoms being more or less
irritation of the intestinal canal.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_606" id="Sect_606"></a>&sect; 606. <b>Post-mortem Appearances.</b>&mdash;It was noticed in the Woolwich
cases that those who died quickly had congestion of the cerebral vessels,
and, in one instance, there was even extravasation of blood, but the man
who died first of all had no congestion of the cerebral vessels. The
lining membrane of the wind-pipe and air tubes was intensely injected
with blood, and the lungs were gorged with fluid blood; the blood in
the heart was black and fluid. The stomach and intestines were externally
of a pink colour. The mucous membrane of the stomach was much
corrugated, and the follicles particularly enlarged. In the two protracted
cases the stomach was not reddened internally, but the vessels of the
brain were congested.</p>

<h4>VIII.&mdash;Oil of Savin.</h4>

<p><a name="Sect_607" id="Sect_607"></a>&sect; 607. The leaves of the <i>Sabina communis</i> (<i>Juniperus Sabina</i>), or
common savin, an evergreen shrub to be found in many gardens, contains
a volatile oil, which has highly irritant properties. Savin leaves are
occasionally used in medicine, maximum dose 1 grm. (15&middot;4 grains).
There is also a tincture&mdash;maximum dose 3 c.c. (about 45 mins.)&mdash;and
an ointment made by mixing eight parts of savin tops with three of
yellow wax and sixteen parts of lard, melting and digesting for twenty
minutes, and then straining through calico. The oil, a tincture, and an
ointment, are officinal pharmaceutical preparations.</p>

<p>The oil of savin is contained to the extent of about 2 per cent. in the
leaves and 10 per cent. in the fruit. It has a peculiar odour, its specific
gravity is &middot;89 to &middot;94, and it boils at 155&deg; to 160&deg;. An infusion of savin
leaves (the leaves being drunk with the liquid) is a popular and very
dangerous abortive.</p>

<p>It is stated by Taylor that oil of savin has no abortive effect, save
that which is to be attributed to its general effect upon the system, but
this is erroneous. R&ouml;hrig found that, when administered to rabbits, it
had a very evident effect upon the pregnant uterus, throwing it into a
tetanic contraction. The action was evident after destruction of the
spinal cord. The plant causes great irritation and inflammation, whether
applied to the skin or taken internally. The symptoms are excruciating
pain, vomiting, and diarrh&#339;a, and the person dies in a kind of collapse.</p>

<p>In a case in which the author was engaged some years ago, a woman,
pregnant by a married man, took an unknown quantity of infusion of
savin tops. She was violently sick, suffered great pain, with diarrh&#339;a,
and died in about 26 hours. The pharynx was much reddened, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
the gullet even congested; the stomach was inflamed, and contained some
greenish matter, in which the author was able to detect savin tops, as
well as to separate by distillation a few drops of a strong savin-like smelling
oil. The time which would elapse between the swallowing of the
poison and the commencement of the pain was an important factor in
this case, for the man was accused of having supplied her with the
infusion. From the redness of the pharynx, and, generally, the rapid
irritation caused by ethereal oils, the author was of opinion that but a
few minutes must have passed between the taking of the liquid and the
sensation of considerable burning pain, although it is laid down in some
works, as for example Falck&#8217;s <i>Toxicologie</i>, that commonly the symptoms
do not commence for several hours. Symptoms which have been noticed
in many cases are&mdash;some considerable irritation of the urinary organs,
such as strangury, bloody urine, &amp;c.; in a few cases vomiting of blood,
in others an&aelig;sthesia, convulsions, and coma. Death may occur within
12 hours, or may be postponed for two or three days.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_608" id="Sect_608"></a>&sect; 608. <b>Post-mortem Appearances.</b>&mdash;More or less inflammation of the
bowels, stomach, and intestinal tract, with considerable congestion of the
kidneys, are the signs usually found.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_609" id="Sect_609"></a>&sect; 609. <b>Separation of the Poison and Identification.</b>&mdash;Hitherto reliance
has been placed entirely on the finding of the savin tops, or on the
odour of the oil. There is no reliable chemical test.</p>

<h4>IX.&mdash;Croton Oil.</h4>

<p><a name="Sect_610" id="Sect_610"></a>&sect; 610. Croton oil is an oil expressed from the seeds of <i>Croton tiglium</i>,
a plant belonging to the natural order <i>Euphorbiace&aelig;</i>, growing in the
West Indies. The seeds are oval in shape, not unlike castor-oil seeds,
and about three-eighths of an inch in length. Both the seeds and the
oil are very poisonous. The chemical composition of croton oil can
scarcely be considered adequately settled. The most recent view, however,
seems to be that it contains a fixed oil (<span class="chemform">C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>14</sub>O<sub>2</sub></span>) with certain
glycerides.<a name="FNanchor_620" id="FNanchor_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> On saponifying and decomposing the soap a series of volatile
fatty acids can be distilled over, the principal of which are methyl
crotonic acid, with small quantities of formic, acetic, iso-butyric, valeric,
and perhaps propionic, and other acids.<a name="FNanchor_621" id="FNanchor_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> The peculiar properties of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
croton are due rather to the fixed oil than to the volatile principles.
The only officinal preparation in the British pharmacop&#339;ia is a &#8220;<i>croton oil
liniment</i>,&#8221; containing one part of croton oil to seven of equal parts of oil
of cajuput and rectified spirit.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_611" id="Sect_611"></a>&sect; 611. <b>Dose.</b>&mdash;The oil is given medicinally as a powerful purgative in
doses up to 65 mgrms. (about a grain). It is used externally as an
irritant or vesicant to the skin. A very dangerous dose would be from
fifteen to twenty times the medicinal dose.</p>

<p><b>Effects.</b>&mdash;Numerous cases of poisoning from large doses of croton oil
are recorded in medical literature, but the sufferers have mostly recovered.
The symptoms are pain, and excessive purging and vomiting.</p>

<p>In the case of a chemist,<a name="FNanchor_622" id="FNanchor_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> who took half an ounce of impure croton
oil instead of cod-liver oil, the purging was very violent, and he had more
than a hundred stools in a few hours; there was a burning pain in the
gullet and stomach, the skin was cyanosed, the pupils dilated, and great
faintness and weakness were felt, yet the man recovered. A child, aged
four, recovered from a teaspoonful of the oil given by mistake directly
after a full meal of bread and milk. In five minutes there were vomiting
and violent purging, but the child was well in two days. A death
occurred in Paris, in 1839, in four hours after taking two and a half
drachms of the oil. The symptoms of the sufferer, a man, were those
just detailed, namely, burning pain in the stomach, vomiting, and purging.
Singularly enough, no marked change was noticed in the mucous membrane
of the stomach when examined after death. An aged woman died
in 3 days from a teaspoonful of croton-oil embrocation; in this case
there were convulsions.</p>

six drops of croton oil. The victim, with others who had partaken of
the food, suffered from vomiting and purging; he became better, but
was subsequently affected with inflammation and ulceration of the bowels,
of which he died. In this case it was not clear whether the inflammation
had anything to do with the jalap and croton oil or not, and the
prisoners were acquitted. In a criminal case in the United States, a
man, addicted to drink, was given, when intoxicated, 2 drachms of croton
oil in a glass of whisky. He vomited, but was not purged, and in about
twelve hours was found dead. The mucous membrane of the stomach
and small intestines proved to be much inflamed, and in some parts
eroded, and croton oil was separated from the stomach.</p>

own.</p>

<p>It is essentially a blood poison, coagulating the blood.</p>

<p>The blood, if carefully freed from all fibrin, is yet again brought to
coagulation by a small amount of this body.</p>

<p>If castor-oil seeds are eaten, a portion of the poison is destroyed by the
digestive processes; a part is not thus destroyed, but is absorbed, and
produces in the blood-vessels its coagulating property. Where this takes
place, ulcers naturally form, because isolated small areas are deprived of
their blood supply. These areas thus becoming dead, may be digested
by the gastric or intestinal fluids, and thus, weeks after, death may be
produced. The symptoms noted are nausea, vomiting, colic, diarrh&#339;a,
tenesmus, thirst, hot skin, frequent pulse, sweats, headache, jaundice, and
death in convulsions or from exhaustion. Animals may be made immune
by feeding them carefully with small doses, gradually increased.</p>

<p>The <i>post-mortem</i> appearances are ulceration in the stomach and intestines.
In animals the appearances of h&aelig;morrhagic gastro-enteritis, with
diffuse nephritis, h&aelig;morrhages in the mesentery and so forth have been

become immune by repeated doses of Jequirity against &#8220;Abrin,&#8221; the
similar substance from castor-oil seeds only confers immunity against the
toxalbumin of those seeds, and not against abrin; and similarly abrin
confers no immunity against the castor albumin. Either of these substances

<p>The general effect of these substances, and, above all, the curious fact
that a person may acquire by use a certain immunity from otherwise fatal
doses is so similar to poisonous products evolved in the system of persons
suffering from infectious fevers, that they have excited of late years much
interest, and a study of their methods of action will throw light upon
many diseased processes.</p>

<p>At present there are no chemical means of detecting the presence of
the toxalbumins mentioned. Should they be ever used for criminal purposes,

<h4>XI.&mdash;Ictrogen.</h4>

<p><a name="Sect_616" id="Sect_616"></a>&sect; 616. <b>Ictrogen.</b>&mdash;Various lupins, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Lupinus luteus</i>, <i>L. angustifolius</i>,
<i>L. thermis</i>, <i>L. linifolius</i>, <i>L. hirsutus</i>, contain a substance of which nothing
chemically is known, save that it may be extracted by weakly alkaline
water, and which has been named &#8220;ictrogen&#8221;; this must not be confused
with the alkaloid of lupins named &#8220;lupinine,&#8221; a bitter tasting substance.
In large doses a nerve poison. Ictrogen has the unusual property of
acting much like phosphorus. It causes yellow atrophy of the liver,
and produces the following symptoms:&mdash;Intense jaundice; at first
enlargement of the liver, afterwards contraction; somnolence, fever,
paralysis. The urine contains albumen and the constituents of the bile.
After death there is found to be parenchymatous degeneration of the
heart, kidneys, muscles, and liver. If the animal has suffered for some
time the liver may be cirrhotic.</p>

<p>Hitherto the cases of poisoning have been confined to animals. Many
thousands of sheep and a few horses and deer have, according to Kobert,
died in Germany from eating lupin seeds. Further information upon
the active principles of lupins may be obtained by referring to the following
treatises:&mdash;G. Schneidemuhl, <i>Die lupinen Krankheit der Schafe</i>;

<h4>XII.&mdash;Cotton Seeds.</h4>

<p><a name="Sect_617" id="Sect_617"></a>&sect; 617. Cotton seeds, used as an adulterant to linseed cake, &amp;c., have
caused the death of sheep and calves. Cotton seeds contain a poison of
which nothing is chemically known, save that it is poisonous. It produces
an&aelig;mia and cachexia in animals when given in small repeated doses.</p>

<p>After death the changes are, under these circumstances, confined to
the kidney; these organs showing all the signs of nephritis. If, however,
the animal has eaten a large quantity of cotton seeds, then there is gastro-enteritis,
as well as inflammation of the kidneys.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h4>XIII.&mdash;Lathyrus Sativus.</h4>

<p><a name="Sect_618" id="Sect_618"></a>&sect; 618. Various species of vetchlings, such as <i>L. sativus</i>, <i>L. cicera</i>,
<i>L. clymenum</i>, are poisonous, and have caused an epidemic malady in parts
of Spain, Africa, France, and Italy, among people who have eaten the
seeds. The symptoms are mainly referable to the nervous system, causing
a transverse myelitis and paraplegia. In this country it is chiefly known
as a poisonous food for horses; the last instance of horse-poisoning by
lathyrus was that of horses belonging to the Bristol Tramways and
Carriage Company.<a name="FNanchor_627" id="FNanchor_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> The company bought some Indian peas; these peas
were found afterwards to consist mainly of the seeds of <i>Lathyrus sativus</i>,
for out of 335 peas no fewer than 325 were the seeds of <i>Lathyrus</i>. The new
peas were substituted for the beans the horses had been having previously
on the 2nd November, and the horses ate them up to the 2nd December.
Soon after the new food had been given, the horses began to stumble and
fall about, not only when at work, but also in their stalls; to these
symptoms succeeded a paralysis of the larynx; this paralysis was in some
cases accompanied by a curious weird screaming, which once having been
heard could never be forgotten; there was also gasping for breath and
symptoms of impending suffocation. A few of the horses were saved by
tracheotomy. Some died of suffocation; one horse beat its brains out in
its struggles for breath; 127 horses were affected; 12 died.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>The above train of symptoms has also been recorded in similar cases;
added to which paralysis of the lower extremities is frequent. After
death atrophy of the laryngeal muscles, wasting of the nervus recurrens,
and atrophy of the ganglion cells of the vagus nucleus as also of the
multipolar ganglion cells in the anterior horns of the spinal cord have
been found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span></p>

<p>The active principle of the seeds has not been satisfactorily isolated.
The symptoms suggest the action of a toxalbumin. Teilleux found a resin
acid; Louis Astier a volatile alkaloid, and he explains the fact that the
seeds, after being heated, are no longer poisonous by the dissipation of
this alkaloid.</p>

and May, and frequent in the hedges of this country, is extremely
poisonous. Bright red succulent attractive berries are seen on a single
stalk, the rest of the plant having rotted away, and these berries are frequently
gathered by children and eaten. The poison belongs to the
class of acrid irritants, but its real nature remains for investigation.</p>

<p>Some of the species of the same natural order growing in the tropics
are far more intensely poisonous.</p>

became ill within forty-eight hours, with high fever; the tongue swelled
and there was much erysipelatous-like infiltration of the tissues of the

<p>The symptoms produced are pain, heaviness of the limbs, faintness,

unsteady gait, dragging of the hind legs, dyspn&#339;a, and paralysis

of the brain and spinal cord with petechia in the meninges; the kidneys
inflamed, the liver and spleen congested, and the lungs &#339;dematous.</p>

<p>There is no characteristic reaction for male fern; the research most likely

tinges red a pine splinter moistened with hydrochloric acid.</p>

<h2>PART VII.&mdash;POISONS DERIVED FROM LIVING OR
DEAD ANIMAL SUBSTANCES.</h2>

<hr class="sec" />

<h3>DIVISION I.&mdash;POISONS SECRETED BY LIVING
ANIMALS.</h3>

<hr class="sec" />

<h4>I.&mdash;Poisonous Amphibia.</h4>

<p><a name="Sect_623" id="Sect_623"></a>&sect; 623. The glands of the skin of certain amphibia possess a secretion
that is poisonous; the animal is unable to empty the poison glands by
any voluntary act, but the secretion can readily be obtained by pressure.
Zalesky found the juice in the skin glands of the <i>Salamandra maculosa</i>,
milky, alkaline in reaction, and bitter in taste. He isolated from it an
organic base, which he named <i>Salamandrine</i> (<span class="chemform">C<sub>34</sub>H<sub>60</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub></span>), it is soluble in
water and in alcohol, and forms salts. Salamandrine is a strong poison;
injected subcutaneously into rabbits it causes shivering, epileptiform
convulsions, and salivation; then tetanus, followed by oppressed respiration,
dilated pupils, and an&aelig;sthesia. Death occurs after a kind of
paralytic state. When given to dogs, it causes vomiting. In frogs,
tetanus occurs first and then paralysis&mdash;the result of all the experiments
being that salamandrine acts on the brain and spinal cord, leaving
the heart and muscular substance unaffected. A similar secretion
obtained from the water salamander (<i>Triton cristatus</i>), causes, according
to Vulpian, the death of dogs in from three to eighteen hours; the
symptoms being progressive weakness, slowing of the respiration, and
depression of the heart&#8217;s action.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_624" id="Sect_624"></a>&sect; 624. The secretion of the skin of the common toad contains methylcarbylaminic
acid, carbylamine, and, according to Fornara, an alkaloid
which is soluble in alcohol, and to which the name of <i>phrynine</i> has been
applied; its action is toxic on all animals experimented upon, save toads.
Administered subcutaneously to frogs, it has a digitalis-like action, causing
rapid paralysis of the heart, and the breathing soon after ceases; the
muscles become early rigid.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span></p>

<h4>II.&mdash;The Poison of the Scorpion.</h4>

<p><a name="Sect_625" id="Sect_625"></a>&sect; 625. There are several species of scorpions. The small European
variety (<i>Scorpio europ&aelig;us</i>) is found in Italy, the south of France, and the
Tyrol; the African scorpion (<i>Bothus afer</i>, L.), which attains the length
of 16 cm., is found in Africa and the East Indies; <i>Androctonus bicolor</i>
in Egypt; and the <i>Androctonus occitanus</i> in Spain, Italy, Greece, and
North Africa.</p>

<p>In the last joint of the tail the scorpion is provided with a poisonous
apparatus, consisting of two oval glands, the canal of which leads into a
round bladder, and this last is connected with a sting. When the sting
is inserted, the bladder contracts, and expels the poison through the
hollow sting into the wound. The smaller kinds of scorpion sting with
as little general effect as a hornet, but the large scorpion of Africa is
capable of producing death. There is first irritation about the wound,
and an erysipelatous inflammation, which may lead to gangrene. Vomiting
and diarrh&#339;a then set in, with general weakness and a fever, which
may last from one to one and a half days; in the more serious cases
there are fainting, delirium, coma, convulsions, and death. According
to G. Sanarelli<a name="FNanchor_632" id="FNanchor_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> the blood corpuscles of birds, fishes, frogs, and salamanders
are dissolved by the poison; only the nucleus remaining intact;
the blood corpuscles of warm-blooded animals are not affected.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_632" id="Footnote_632"></a><a href="#FNanchor_632"><span class="label">[632]</span></a> G. Sanarelli, <i>Bollet. della Soc. della sez. dei cult. delle
Scienze med.</i>, v., 1888, 202.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>Valentin made some experiments on frogs with the <i>Androctonus
occitanus</i>. He found that soon after the sting the animal remains quiet,
but on irritation it moves, and is thrown into a transitory convulsion; to
this follow twitchings of single muscular bundles. The frog is progressively
paralysed, and the reflex irritability is gradually extinguished from
behind forwards; at first the muscles may be excited by electrical stimuli
to the nerves, but later they are only capable of contraction by direct
stimuli.</p>

<hr class="sec" />

<h4>III.&mdash;Poisonous Fish.</h4>

<p><a name="Sect_626" id="Sect_626"></a>&sect; 626. A large number of fish possess poisonous properties; in some
cases the poison is local; in others the poison is in all parts of the body.</p>

<p>Many fish are provided with poison glands in connection with the fins
or special weapons, and such are used for purposes of defence; for example,
<i>Synanceia brachio</i> is provided with a back fin consisting of 13
spines, each of which has two poison reservoirs; the reservoirs are connected
with 10 to 12 tubular glands which secrete the poison, a clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
feebly acid bluish fluid, exciting in a concentrated condition, local gangrene;
in a diluted one, paralysis of the nervous centres.</p>

<p>Another kind of localisation is the localisation in certain of the internal
organs. Remy states, that there are twelve varieties of <i>Tetrodon</i> in
Japanese waters, all of which are poisonous. M. Minra and K. Takesaki<a name="FNanchor_633" id="FNanchor_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a>
find that the poison of the <i>Tetrodon</i> is confined to the sexual
organs of the female, and at the time of activity of these glands, the
poisonous properties are most intense; but, even in winter, when the
glands are atrophied, Remy found the glands were so poisonous that he
could prepare from them a fluid, which, administered subcutaneously,
killed dogs within two hours. The symptoms in the dog are restlessness,
salivation, vomiting of slimy masses, dilatation of the pupil, paralysis and
great dyspn&#339;a. Death occurs by the lung. After death the appearances
are similar to those from asphyxia; in addition to which there are small
ecchymoses in the stomach and intestines; the salivary glands and pancreas
are also injected. The symptoms observed in man are similar,
there is headache, dilated pupils, vomiting, sometimes h&aelig;matamesis, convulsions,
paralysis, dyspn&#339;a and death.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>Some fishes are poisonous on account of the food they live upon; the
<i>Meletta venenosa</i> is only poisonous when it feeds upon a certain green
monad; <i>Clupea thrissa</i>, <i>C. venenosa</i> and certain species of <i>Scarus</i>, neither
possess poison glands nor poisonous ovaries; but also derive their
poisonous properties from their food. In the West Indies it is well-known
that fish caught off certain coral banks are unwholesome, while
the same species caught elsewhere may be eaten with safety.</p>

<p>A good many shell-fish, especially mussels, occasionally cause intense
poisonous symptoms; those usually noticed are high fever, nettle rash,
dilated pupils, and diarrh&#339;a. It may be that in these cases a ptomaine,
the product of bacterial action, has been ingested. To the agency of
bacteria has been ascribed illness produced in Russia by a good many
fish of the sturgeon species. The symptoms are those of cerebro-spinal
paralysis. The &#8220;Icthyismus gastricus&#8221; of Germany may belong to the
same type. Prochorow<a name="FNanchor_634" id="FNanchor_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> has described illness from ingestion of <i>Petromyzon
fluviatilis</i> in Russia. Whether the fish was eaten raw or cooked,
the effect was the same, producing a violent diarrh&#339;a, dysenteric in
character. Even the broth in which the fish had been boiled produced
symptoms. Fresh blood of the eel is stated to be intensely poisonous;
this property is apparently due to a toxalbumin; Pennavaria<a name="FNanchor_635" id="FNanchor_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> relates the
case of a man who took, in 200 c.c. of wine, 0&middot;64 kilo. of fresh eel blood
and suffered from diarrh&#339;a with symptoms of collapse.</p>

<p>In the <i>Linnean Transactions</i> for November, 1860, is recorded a fatal
accident, which took place on board the Dutch ship &#8220;Postillion&#8221; at
Simon&#8217;s Bay, Cape of Good Hope. The boatswain and purser&#8217;s steward
partook of the liver of the <i>toad</i> or <i>ball-bladder</i> (<i>Diodon</i>); within twenty
minutes the steward died; in ten minutes the boatswain was violently
ill; the face flushed, the eyes glistening, and the pupils contracted; there
was cyanosis of the face, the pulse was weak and intermittent, and swallowing
was difficult, the breathing became embarrassed, and the body
generally paralysed. Death took place in seventeen minutes. The liver
of one fish only is said to have been eaten. This might weigh 4
drachms. If the account given is literally correct, the intensity of the
poison equals that of any known substance.</p>

<p>The poisonous nature of the goby has also led to several accidents, and
we possess a few experiments made by Dr. Collas,<a name="FNanchor_636" id="FNanchor_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> who fed chickens with
different parts of the fish, and proved that all parts were alike poisonous.
The effects were slow in developing; they commenced in about an hour
or an hour and a half, and were well developed in five hours, mainly
consisting of progressive muscular weakness and prostration. Death
occurred without convulsions.</p>

<h4>IV.&mdash;Poisonous Spiders and Other Insects.</h4>

<p><a name="Sect_627" id="Sect_627"></a>&sect; 627. It is probable that all spiders are poisonous; the only species,
however, of which we have any definite information relative to their
poisonous properties, are <i>Lycosa tarantula</i> and the <i>Latrodectus malmignatus</i>,
to which may be added the New Zealand <i>katipo</i>. These spiders
possess a poisonous gland connected with their masticatory apparatus,
which secretes a clear, oily, bitter acid-reacting fluid; the acidity seems
due to formic acid.</p>

<p>Zangrilli has observed several cases of tarantula bite; soon after the
occurrence the part bitten is an&aelig;sthetic, after a few hours there are convulsive
shiverings of the legs, cramps of the muscles, inability to stand,
spasm of the pharyngeal muscles, quickening of the pulse, and a three
days&#8217; fever, with vomiting of yellow, bilious matter; recovery follows
after copious perspiration. In one case there was tetanus, and death on
the fourth day. The extraordinary effects attributed to the bite of the
tarantula, called <i>tarantism</i> in the Middle Ages, are well detailed by
Hecker;<a name="FNanchor_637" id="FNanchor_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> this excitement was partly hysterical and partly delirious, and

Mr. W. H. Wright has recorded the case of a person who, in 1865, was
bitten by this spider on the shoulder. The part rapidly became swollen,
and looked like a large nettle-rash wheal; in an hour the patient could
hardly walk, the respiration and circulation were both affected, and there
was great muscular prostration; but he recovered in a few hours. In
other cases, if the accounts given are to be relied upon, the bite of the
spider has produced a chronic illness, accompanied by wasting of the
body, followed by death after periods varying from six weeks to three
months.<a name="FNanchor_638" id="FNanchor_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a></p>

glands which secrete <i>formic acid</i>. Certain exotic species of ants are
provided with a sting, but the common ant of this country has no special
piercing apparatus. The insect bites, and then squirts the irritating
secretion into the wound, causing local symptoms of swelling and inflammation.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_630" id="Sect_630"></a>&sect; 630. <b>Wasps, &amp;c.</b>&mdash;Wasps, bees, and hornets all possess a poison-bag
and sting. The fluid secreted is as clear as water, and of an acid
reaction; it certainly contains formic acid, with some other poisonous
constituent. An erysipelatous inflammation generally arises round the
sting, and in those cases in which persons have been attacked by a swarm
of bees, signs of general poisoning, such as vomiting, fainting, delirium,
and stupor, have been noticed. Death has occasionally resulted.</p>

entire, or the dried and powdered blister-beetle, or Spanish fly (<i>Cantharis
vesicatoria</i>). The most common appearance is that of a greyish-brown
powder, containing shining green particles, from which cantharidin is
readily extracted by exhausting with chloroform, driving off the chloroform
by distillation or evaporation, and subsequently treating the extract
with bisulphide of carbon, which dissolves the fatty matters only.
Finally, the cantharidin may be recrystallised from chloroform, the
yield being &middot;380 to &middot;570 per cent. Ferrer found in the wings and their
cases, &middot;082 per cent.; in the head and antenn&aelig;, &middot;088; in the legs, &middot;091;
in the thorax and abdomen, &middot;240; in the whole insect, &middot;278 per cent.
Wolff found in the <i>Lytta aspera</i>, &middot;815 per cent.; Ferrer in <i>Mylabris

four-sided columns with four surfaces, each surface being beset
with needles; and (2) flat tables. It is the anhydride of a ketone acid
(cantharidic acid), <span class="chemform">C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>13</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-CO-COOH</span>. It is soluble in alkaline
liquids, and can be recovered from them by acidifying and shaking up
with <i>ether</i>, <i>chloroform</i>, or <i>benzene</i>; it is almost completely insoluble in
water. 100 parts of alcohol (99 per cent.) dissolve at 18&deg; 0&middot;125 part;
100 of bisulphide of carbon, at the same temperature, 0&middot;06 part; ether,
&middot;11 part; chloroform, 1&middot;2 part; and benzene, &middot;2 part. Cantharidin can
be completely sublimed, if placed in the subliming cell (described at
<a href="#Page_258">p. 258</a>), floating on mercury; a scanty sublimate of crystals may be
obtained at so low a temperature as 82&middot;5&deg;; at 85&deg;, and above, the sublimation
is rapid. If the cantharidin is suddenly heated, it melts; but
this is not the case if the temperature is raised gradually. The tube
melting-point is as high as 218&deg;. Potassic chromate with sulphuric acid
decomposes cantharidin with the production of the green oxide of
chromium. An alkaline solution of permanganate, iodic acid, and sodium
amalgam, are all without influence on an alcoholic solution of cantharidin.
With bases, cantharidin forms crystallisable salts, and, speaking generally,
if the base is soluble in water, the &#8220;<i>cantharidate</i>&#8221; is also soluble; the
lime and magnesic salts dissolve readily. From the soda or potash salt,
mineral acid will precipitate crystals of cantharidin; on heating with
pentasulphide of phosphorus, o-xylol is produced.</p>

<p><i>Tincture of cantharides</i>, containing about &middot;005 per cent. of cantharidin.</p>

<p>A solution of cantharides for blistering purposes, <i>Liquor epispasticus</i>,
a strong solution of the active principle in ether and acetic acid, containing
about &middot;16 per cent. of cantharidin.</p>

<p>There are also&mdash;An <i>ointment</i>; a blistering paper, <i>Charta epispastica</i>;
a blistering plaster, <i>Emplastrum cantharides</i>; and a warm plaster,
<i>Emplastrum calefaciens</i>.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_634" id="Sect_634"></a>&sect; 634. <b>Fatal Dose.</b>&mdash;It is difficult to state the fatal dose of cantharidin,
the unassayed powder or tincture having mostly been taken.
A young woman died from 1&middot;62 grm. (25 grains) of the powder, which
is perhaps equivalent to 6&middot;4 mgrms. (1 grain) of cantharidin, whilst the
smallest dose of the tincture known to have been fatal is (according to
Taylor) an ounce. This would be generally equivalent to 15 mgrms.
(&middot;24 grain). Hence the fatal dose of cantharidin may be approximately
stated as from 6 mgrms. upwards. But, on the other hand, recovery has
taken place from very large doses.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_635" id="Sect_635"></a>&sect; 635. <b>Effects on Animals.</b>&mdash;Certain animals do not appear susceptible
to the action of cantharidin. For example, hedgehogs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
swallows are said to be able to take it with impunity. Radecki<a name="FNanchor_639" id="FNanchor_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> found that
cantharidin might even be injected into the blood of fowls without any
injury, and frogs also seem to enjoy the same impunity; while dogs, cats,
and other animals are sensitive to the poison. Galippe ascertained that
after the injection of 5 mgrms. into the veins of a dog, there was exaltation
of the sexual desire; the pupils quickly dilated, the dog sought
a dark place, and became sleepy. Animals when poisoned die in
asphyxia from paralysis of the respiratory centre. Schachowa<a name="FNanchor_640" id="FNanchor_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> made
some observations on the effect of cantharides on the renal excretion
of a dog fed daily with 1 grm. in powder. On the third day, pus
corpuscles were noticed; on the fifth, bacteria; on the thirteenth,
the urine contained a large quantity of fatty matters, and several
casts; and on the seventeenth, red shrivelled blood corpuscles were
observed.</p>

<p><b>Effects on Man.</b>&mdash;Heinrich<a name="FNanchor_641" id="FNanchor_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> made the following experiments upon
himself:&mdash;Thirty living blister-beetles were killed, and digested, without
drying, in 35 grms. of alcohol for fourteen days, of this tincture ten
drops were taken. There ensued immediately a feeling of warmth in
the mouth and stomach, salivation, the pulse was more frequent than in
health, there was a pleasant feeling of warmth about the body, and
some sexual excitement lasting three hours. In half an hour there was
abdominal pain, diarrh&#339;a, and tenesmus, and frequent painful micturition.
These symptoms subsided in a few hours, but there was a want of
appetite, and pain about the kidneys lasting until the following day.
In the second experiment, on taking 1 cgrm. of cantharidin, there were
very serious symptoms of poisoning. Blisters formed on the tongue, and
there was salivation, with great difficulty in swallowing, and a general
feeling of illness. Seven hours after taking the poison, there were
frequent micturitions of bloody urine, diarrh&#339;a, and vomiting. Twenty
hours after the ingestion the face was red, the skin hot, the pulse twenty
beats beyond the normal pulsation, the tongue was denuded to two-thirds of
its extent of its epithelium, and the lips and mucous membrane were red and
swollen; there was great pain in the stomach, intestines, and in the
neighbourhood of the kidneys, continuous desire to micturate, burning of
the urethra, and swelling of the glands. There was no sexual excitement
whatever; the urine was ammoniacal, and contained blood and pus;
the symptoms gradually subsided, but recovery was not complete for
fourteen days.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_636" id="Sect_636"></a>&sect; 636. The foregoing is a fair picture of what may be expected in cantharides
poisoning. It is remarkable that the popular idea as to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
influence of cantharidin in exciting the sexual passion, holds good only
as to the entire cantharides, and not with cantharidin. It is very
possible that cantharidin is not the only poisonous principle in the insect.
The symptoms in other cases, fatal or not, have been as follows:&mdash;Immediate
burning in the mouth and throat, extending to the stomach and
alimentary canal, and increasing in intensity until there is considerable
pain. Then follow salivation, difficulty in swallowing, and vomiting, and
generally diarrh&#339;a, pain in the kidneys, irritation of the bladder,
priapism, and strangury, are all present. The pulse is accelerated, the
breathing disturbed, there are pains in the head, and often mydriasis,
giddiness, insensibility, delirium, and convulsions; trismus has been
noticed. The desire to micturate frequently is urgent, the urine is
generally bloody, and contains pus. Pregnant women have been known
to abort. In a few of the cases in which a different course has been
run, the nervous symptoms have predominated over those of gastro-intestinal
irritation, and the patient has sunk in a kind of collapse.
In a case of chronic poisoning by cantharides, extending over three
months, and recorded by Tarchioni Bonfanti,<a name="FNanchor_642" id="FNanchor_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> after the first dose
appeared tetanic convulsions, which subsided in twenty-four hours,
there was later cystitis, and from time to time the tetanic convulsions
returned; gastro-enteritis followed with frequent vomiting, when, cantharides
being found in the matters ejected, the otherwise obscure nature
of the illness was shown.</p>

an unpleasant smell, recalling the notion formerly held that cantharides imparted
a peculiar odour to the breath and urine. In a case of chronic
poisoning related by Tardieu, six students, during several months, used
what they thought was pepper with their food, but the substance proved
to be really powdered cantharides. The quantity taken each day was
probably small, but they suffered from pain about the loins, and also
irritation of the bladder. There was no sexual excitement.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_637" id="Sect_637"></a>&sect; 637. <b>Post-mortem Appearances.</b>&mdash;In a French criminal case, in
which a man poisoned his step-brother by giving cantharides in soup, the
pathological signs of inflammation of the gastro-intestinal tract were
specially evident, the mouth was swollen, the tonsils ulcerated, the
gullet, stomach, and intestines were inflamed, and the mucous membrane
of the intestines covered with purulent matter. In another case there
was an actual perforation 3 inches from the pylorus. The inflammatory
appearances, however, are not always so severe, being confined to
swelling and inflammation without ulceration. In all cases there has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
been noted inflammation of the kidneys and urinary passages, and this
is seen even when cantharidin is administered to animals by subcutaneous
injection. In the urine will be found blood and fatty epithelial
casts, as well as pus. The contents of the stomach or the intestines will
probably contain some remnants of powdered cantharides, if the powder
itself has been taken.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_638" id="Sect_638"></a>&sect; 638. <b>Tests for Cantharidin, and its Detection in the Tissues, &amp;c.</b>&mdash;The
tests for cantharidin are&mdash;(1.) Its form, (2.) its action in the
subliming cell, and (3.) its power of raising a blister.</p>

<p>The most convenient method of testing its vesicating properties, is to
allow a chloroformic solution of the substance supposed to be cantharidin
to evaporate to dryness, to add to this a drop of olive oil (or almond oil),
and to take a drop up on the smallest possible quantity of cotton wool,
and apply the wool to the inside of the arm, covering it with good oilskin,
and strapping the whole on by the aid of sticking-plaster. In about an
hour or more the effect is examined. The thin skin of the lips is far
more easily blistered than that of the arm, but the application there is
inconvenient.</p>

<p>Dragendorff has ascertained that cantharidin is not present in the
contents of a blister raised by a cantharides plaster, although it has been
found in the urine of a person treated by one; and Pettenkofer has also
discovered cantharidin in the blood of a boy to whose spine a blister had
been applied.</p>

<p>The great insolubility of cantharidin in water has led to various hypotheses
as to its absorption into the system. It is tolerably easily dissolved
by potash, soda, and ammonia solutions, and is also taken up in
small proportion by sulphuric, phosphoric, and lactic acids. The resulting
compounds quickly diffuse themselves through animal membranes.
Even the salts with lime, magnesia, alumina, and the heavy metals, are
not quite insoluble. A solution of salt with cantharidin, put in a dialysing
apparatus, separates in twenty-four hours enough cantharidin to raise
a blister.</p>

<p>Cantharidin has actually been discovered in the heart, brain, muscles,
contents of the stomach, intestines, and f&aelig;ces (as well as in the blood
and urine) of animals poisoned by the substance. A urine containing
cantharidin is alkaline and albuminous. Cantharidin, although readily
decomposed by chemical agents, is so permanent in the body that it has
been detected in the corpse of a cat eighty-four days after death.</p>

<p>In any forensic case, the defence will not improbably be set up that
some animal (<i>e.g.</i>, a fowl poisoned by cantharides) has been eaten and caused
the toxic symptoms, for cantharides is an interesting example of a substance
which, as before stated, for certain animals (such as rabbits, dogs,
cats, and ducks), is a strong poison, whilst in others (<i>e.g.</i>, hedgehogs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
fowls, turkeys, and frogs), although absorbed and excreted, it appears
inert. Experiment has shown that a cat may be readily poisoned by a
fowl saturated with cantharides; and in Algeria the military surgeons
meet with cystitis among the soldiers, caused by eating frogs in the
months of May and June, the frogs living in these months almost exclusively
on a species of cantharides.</p>

<p>Dragendorff recommends the following process:&mdash;The finely-pulped
substance is boiled in a porcelain dish with potash-lye (1 part of potash
and 12 to 18 of water) until the fluid is of a uniform consistence. The
fluid, after cooling, is (if necessary) diluted with an equal bulk of water,
for it must not be too thick; then shaken with chloroform in order to
remove impurities; and after separation of the chloroform, strongly
acidified with sulphuric acid, and mixed with about four times its volume
of alcohol of 90 to 95 per cent. The mixture is kept for some time at a
boiling temperature, filtered hot, and the alcohol distilled from the filtrate.
The watery fluid is now again treated with chloroform, as above
described. The chloroform extract is washed with water, the residue
taken up on some hot almond oil, and its blistering properties investigated.
The mass, heated with potash in the above way, can also be
submitted to dialysis, the diffusate supersaturated with sulphuric acid,
and shaken up with chloroform.</p>

<p>In order to test further for cantharidin, it can be dissolved in the least
possible potash or soda-lye. The solution, on evaporation in the water-bath,
leaves crystals of a salt not easily soluble in alcohol, and the watery solution
of which gives with chloride of calcium and baryta a white precipitate;
with sulphate of copper and sulphate of protoxide of nickel, a green;
with cobaltous sulphate, a red; with sugar of lead, mercury chloride
and argentic nitrate, a white crystalline precipitate. With palladium
chloride there occurs a yellow, hair-like, crystalline precipitate; later
crystals, which are isomorphous with the nickel and copper salts.</p>

<p>If the tincture of cantharides has been used in considerable quantity,
the urine may be examined; in such a case there will collect on the
surface drops of a green oil, which may be extracted by petroleum
ether; this oil is not blister-raising. Cantharides in powder may, of
course, be detected by its appearance.</p>

<p>To the question whether the method proposed would extract any other
blister-producing substance, the answer is negative, since ethereal oil
of mustard would be decomposed, and the active constituents of the
<i>Euphorbias</i> do not withstand the treatment with <span class="chemform">KHO</span>. Oils of
anemone and anemonin are dissolved by <span class="chemform">KHO</span>, and again separated
out of their solutions, but their blistering property is destroyed. They
are volatile, and found in anemone and some of the <i>Ranunculace&aelig;</i>. In
the <i>Aqua pulsatilla</i> there is an oil of anemone, which may be obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
by shaking with ether; but this oil is not permanent, and if the <i>Aqua
pulsatilla</i> stand for a little time, it splits up into anemonic acid and
anemonin, and then cannot be reobtained. A blistering substance,
obtained from the <i>Anacardia orientalia</i> and the fruit of the <i>Anacardium
occidentale</i> and <i>Semecarpus anacardium</i>, is not quite destroyed by a short
action with potash, but is by one of long duration; this substance, however,
cannot be confused with cantharidin, for it is oily, yellow, easily
soluble in alcohol and ether, and differs in other respects.</p>

<h4>V.&mdash;Snake Poison.</h4>

<p><a name="Sect_639" id="Sect_639"></a>&sect; 639. The poisonous snakes belong chiefly to two classes, the <i>Proteroglypha</i>
and the <i>Solenoglypha</i>.</p>

<p>Weir Mitchell and Ed. T. Reichert<a name="FNanchor_644" id="FNanchor_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> have made some important
experiments on snake poison, using the venom of some 200 snakes.
Most of the snakes were rattlesnakes, a few were cobras and other
species. They came to the conclusion that the active constituents
are contained in the fluid part alone, the solid particles suspended in
the fluid having no action. The poison they considered to consist of
two toxalbumins, one a globulin, acting more particularly on the blood,
the other, a peptone (albumose?), acting more particularly on the tissues.
Differences in snake venom depend on the relative proportions of these
two substances. The peptone, which acts more especially locally on the
tissues, determines an inflammatory action, with much swelling and
multiple extravasation of blood, which may proceed to a moist gangrene.
The globulin has a paralysing influence on the heart, the vasomotor
centres, the peripheral ends of the splanchnic nerves, as well as
on the respiratory centres of both warm and cold-blooded animals.
Feoktisow&#8217;s<a name="FNanchor_645" id="FNanchor_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> researches show that although the heart continues to
beat after the respiration has ceased for a few minutes, it has no force.
The blood pressure sinks immediately after the injection. Whether the
globulin is injected subcutaneously or direct into the veins, there is
commonly considerable extravasation of blood in the chest and abdomen;
the intestine is often filled with blood as well as the pericardium; and
the urine is bloody. The poison of <i>Vipera ammodytes</i> in watery solution
may be boiled for six minutes, and yet is as active as before. According
to Lewin, snake poison generally can be heated to 125&deg; and yet preserve
its poisonous properties. These last observations are not in accordance
with the belief of some that the active principle of snake venom is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
ferment, or, indeed, in harmony with the idea that it is a globulin or
toxalbumin; for such bodies have not, so far as we know, the stability
to withstand so high a degree of heat.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_640" id="Sect_640"></a>&sect; 640. <b>The Poison of the Cobra.</b>&mdash;The poison excreted from the
salivary glands of the cobra di capello is the most deadly animal fluid
known. When first ejected, it is an amber-coloured, rather syrupy,
frothy liquid, of specific gravity 1&middot;046, and of feeble acid reaction;
it dries rapidly on exposure to air to a yellow film, which readily
breaks up into brilliant yellow granules, closely imitating crystals.
The yellow powder is very acrid and pungent to the nostrils, and excites
a painful (though transitory) inflammation, if applied to the mucous
membrane of the eye; the taste is bitter, and it raises little blisters on
the tongue. It is perfectly stable, and preserves its activity for an
indefinite time. The dried poison as described is perfectly soluble in
water, and if the water is added in proper proportions, the original fluid
is without doubt reproduced, the solution usually depositing a sediment
of epithelial <i>d&eacute;bris</i>, and often containing little white threads.</p>

<p>The poison has been examined by several chemists, but until of late
years with a negative result. The writer was the first to isolate, in
1876, a crystalline principle, which appears to be the sole acting
ingredient; the yellow granules were dissolved in water, the albumen
which the venom so copiously contains coagulated by alcohol, and
separated by filtration; the alcohol was then driven off at a gentle
heat, the liquid concentrated to a small bulk, and precipitated with
basic acetate of lead. The precipitate was separated, washed, and
decomposed in the usual way by SH<sub>2</sub>, and on removing the lead
sulphide, crystals having toxic properties were obtained.</p>

<p>Pedler,<a name="FNanchor_646" id="FNanchor_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> precipitating the albumen by alcohol, and then to the alcoholic
solution adding platinic chloride, obtained a semi-crystalline precipitate,
which from an imperfect combustion he thinks may have something like
the composition <span class="chemform">PtCl<sub>4</sub>(C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>25</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub>HCl)<sub>2</sub></span>. I have examined the platinum
compound, and made several combustions of different fractions, but was
unable to obtain the compound in a sufficient state of purity to deduce a
formula. My analysis agreed with those of Pedler for nitrogen&mdash;viz.,
9&middot;93 per cent. (Pedler, 9&middot;69); hydrogen 4&middot;17 (Pedler, 4&middot;28); but were
higher for carbon, 41&middot;8 per cent. (Pedler, 33&middot;42 per cent.); one fraction
gave 7&middot;3 per cent. of platinum, another double that amount. Material was
insufficient to thoroughly investigate the compound, but it was evident
that several double salts were formed. The blood of the cobra is also
poisonous. A. Calmette<a name="FNanchor_647" id="FNanchor_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> has found that 2 c.c. of fresh cobra blood,
injected into the peritoneum of a rabbit weighing 1&middot;5 kilo., causes death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>

therefore, the lethal power is represented by something like &middot;07 to
&middot;09 mgrm. per kilo., if the pure toxic principle free from albumen and
diluting impurities be considered.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_642" id="Sect_642"></a>&sect; 642. <b>Effects on Animals.</b>&mdash;Almost immediately local pain or signs
of uneasiness at the seat of injection are observed. There is then a
variable interval, seldom exceeding 20 minutes (and generally much
less), but in one of my experiments half an hour elapsed after the
injection of a fatal dose before any effect was evident. The symptoms
once produced, the course is rapid, and consists, first, of acceleration of
the respirations, and then a progressive slowing, soon followed by convulsions.
The convulsions are probably produced by the interference
with the respiration and the deficient oxidation of the blood, and are
therefore, the so-called &#8220;carbonic acid convulsions.&#8221; There is paresis or
paralysis of the limbs. Death seems to occur from asphyxia, and the
heart beats for one or more minutes after the respirations have ceased.
If the dose is so small as not to produce death, no after-effects have
been observed; recovery is complete.</p>

<p>Sir J. Fayrer, and Dr. Lauder Brunton consider that the terminations
of the motor nerves suffer; on the other hand, Dr. Wall would explain
the phenomena by referring the action entirely to the central nervous
system, and concludes that the effects of the cobra poison consist in the
extinction of function extending from below upwards of the various
nerve centres constituting the cerebro-spinal system. In addition to
this, there is a special and rapid action on the respiratory and allied
nuclei, and this it is that causes death.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_643" id="Sect_643"></a>&sect; 643. <b>Effects on Man.</b>&mdash;By far the best account hitherto published
of the effects of the cobra poison is a paper by Dr. Wall,<a name="FNanchor_648" id="FNanchor_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> in which
he points out the very close similarity between the symptoms produced
and those of glosso-pharyngeal paralysis. This is well shown in the
following typical case:&mdash;A coolie was bitten on the shoulder about
twelve at midnight by a cobra; he immediately felt burning pain at
the spot bitten, which increased. In fifteen minutes afterwards he
began, he said, to feel intoxicated, but he seemed rational, and answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
questions intelligently. The pupils were natural, and the pulse normal;
the respirations were also not accelerated. He next began to lose power
over his legs, and staggered. In thirty minutes after the bite his lower
jaw began to fall, and frothy viscid mucous saliva ran from his mouth;
he spoke indistinctly, like a man under the influence of liquor, and the
paralysis of the legs increased. Forty minutes after the bite, he began
to moan and shake his head from side to side, and the pulse and respirations
were somewhat accelerated; but he was still able to answer questions,
and seemed conscious. There was no paralysis of the arms. The
breathing became slower and slower, and at length ceased one hour and
ten minutes after the bite, the heart beating for about one minute after
the respiration had stopped.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>There is often very little sign of external injury, merely a scratch or
puncture being apparent, but the areolar tissue lying beneath is of a
purple colour, and infiltrated with a large quantity of coagulable, purple,
blood-like fluid. In addition, the whole of the neighbouring vessels are
intensely injected, the injection gradually diminishing as the site of the
poisoned part is receded from, so that a bright scarlet ring surrounds a
purple area, and this in its turn fades into the normal colour of the neighbouring
tissues. At the margin is also a purple blood-like fluid, replaced
by a pinkish serum, which may often be traced up in the tissues surrounding
the vessels that convey the poison to the system, and may extend a
considerable distance. These appearances are to be accounted for in
great part by the irritant properties of the cobra venom. The local
hyper&aelig;mia and the local pain are the first symptoms. In man there
follows an interval (which may be so short as a few minutes, or so long as
four hours) before any fresh symptoms appear; the average duration of
the interval is, according to Dr. Wall, about an hour. When once the
symptoms are developed, then the course is rapid, and, as in the case
quoted, a feeling like that of intoxication is first produced, and then
loss of power over the legs. This is followed by a loss of power over
the speech, over swallowing, and the movement of the lips; the tongue
becomes motionless, and hangs out of the mouth; the saliva is secreted
in large quantities, and runs down the face, the patient being equally
unable to swallow it or to eject it, and the glosso-pharyngeal paralysis
is complete.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_644" id="Sect_644"></a>&sect; 644. <b>Antidotes and Treatment.</b>&mdash;Professor Halford some years ago
proposed ammonia, and M. Lacerda in recent times has declared potassic
permanganate an antidote to the cobra poison. The ammonia theory has
been long disproved, and before Lacerda had made his experiments I had
published the chemical aspect of some researches,<a name="FNanchor_649" id="FNanchor_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> which showed that
mixing the cobra venom with an alkaline solution of potassic permanganate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
destroyed its poisonous properties. Other experiments were also
made in every conceivable way with potassic permanganate, injecting it
separately, yet simultaneously, into different parts of the same animal&#8217;s
body, but so long as it does not come into actual contact with the poison
it has no antidotal power whatever over the living subject. Other
observers, previous to the researches mentioned and since, all agree that
permanganate is no true antidote.<a name="FNanchor_650" id="FNanchor_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> It only acts when it comes directly
into contact with the venom, but when the venom is once absorbed into
the circulation potassic permanganate, whether acid, alkaline, or neutral,
is powerless. That it is of great use when applied to a bite is unquestionable,
for it neutralises or changes any of the venom hanging about the
wound, and which, if allowed to remain, might yet be absorbed; but here
it is obvious that the venom is, so to speak, outside the body. A. Galmette
(<i>Annales de l&#8217;Institut Pasteur</i>, 25th March 1892) has found that gold
chloride forms an insoluble compound with the cobra poison, which is not
poisonous, and that animal living tissues impregnated with gold chloride
will not absorb the poison. He even advances some evidence tending to
show that gold chloride may overtake, as it were, the venom in the circulation,
and thus act as a true antidote. This is improbable, and, until
confirmed, the general treatment most likely to be successful is the immediate
sucking of the wound, followed by the application of an alkaline
solution of permanganate; and lastly, if the symptoms should nevertheless
develop, an attempt should be made to maintain the breathing by
galvanism and artificial respiration.<a name="FNanchor_651" id="FNanchor_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_651" id="Footnote_651"></a><a href="#FNanchor_651"><span class="label">[651]</span></a> Some of my experiments on the cobra poison may be briefly
detailed, illustrating the general statement in the text:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. A quantity equal to 1 mgrm. of the dried venom was injected
subcutaneously into a chicken. The symptoms began in two minutes with
loss of power over both legs. In eight minutes the legs were perfectly
paralysed. There were convulsive movements of the head and wings,
slowing of the respiration, and death in ten minutes. The same quantity
of poison was treated with a little tannin, and the clear liquid which
separated from the precipitate injected into another chicken. The
respiration became affected in ten minutes; in eighteen minutes the bird
had become very quiet, and lay insensible; in twenty minutes it was
dead, the respiration ceasing before the heart.</p>

<p>2. In seven experiments with cobra poison, first rendered feebly
alkaline with an alkaline solution of potassic permanganate, no effect
followed. Three of the experiments were on chickens, four on rabbits.</p>

<p>3. A chicken was injected with 1 mgrm. of cobra poison in one leg, and
in the other simultaneously with a solution of potassic permanganate.
Death followed in sixteen minutes. Another chicken was treated in the
same way, but with injections of potassic permanganate solution every
few minutes. Death resulted in thirty-seven minutes. Four other similar
experiments were made&mdash;two with feebly alkaline permanganate, two with
permanganate made feebly acid with sulphuric acid&mdash;but death occurred
with the usual symptoms.</p>

<p>4. Cobra poison was mixed with a weak solution of iodine, and a quantity
equal to half a mgrm. was injected into a chicken. The symptoms began
directly, were fully developed in ten minutes, and death took place in
twenty-one minutes.</p>

<p>5. Equal volumes of cobra venom and aldehyde were mixed, and a quantity
equivalent to 1 mgrm. of the cobra poison injected. The symptoms were
immediate paralysis and insensibility, and the respiration rapidly fell.
Death occurred in four minutes without convulsions.</p>

<p>6. The cobra venom was mixed with a feebly alkaline solution of
pyrogallic acid, and injected subcutaneously into a chicken. In six
minutes the usual symptoms commenced, followed in thirteen minutes by
death.</p>

<p>7. One mgrm. was injected into a chicken. The respirations at the
commencement were 120; in twenty-two minutes they sank to 96, in
twenty-five minutes to 84, in twenty-seven minutes to 18, and then to
occasional gasps, with slight movement of the wings and toes. There was
death in thirty-two minutes after the injection.</p>

<p>8. A young rabbit was injected with &middot;5 mg. (equal to 1 mgrm. per kilo.)
of cobra poison. In two hours it was apparently moribund, with
occasional short gasps. Artificial respiration was now attempted. There
was considerable improvement, but it was intermitted during the night,
and the animal was found dead in the morning, having certainly lived six
hours.</p>

<p>9. A strong healthy kitten was injected with 1 mgrm. of cobra venom
(equal to 5 mgrms. per kilo.). In twenty minutes the symptoms were well
developed, and in an hour the animal was gasping&mdash;about twelve short
respirations per minute. Artificial respiration was kept up for two
hours, and the animal recovered, but there was great muscular weakness
lasting for more than twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>10. A brown rabbit, weighing about 2 kilos., was injected with 12 mgrms.
(6 per kilo.) of the cobra poison. The symptoms developed within ten
minutes; ammonia was injected, and also given by the nostril. The
heart&#8217;s action, which, previous to the administration of the ammonia,
had been beating feebly, became accelerated, but death followed within
the hour, the heart beating two minutes after the respiration had
ceased.</p>

<p>11. A brown rabbit, about 2 kilos. in weight, was injected with 1&middot;5
mgrms. of cobra poison (&middot;75 per kilo.). There were no symptoms for
nearly an hour, then sudden convulsions, and death.</p>

<p>12. Another rabbit of the same size was treated similarly, but
immediately after the injection made to breathe nitrous oxide; death
took place in thirty minutes. A rabbit, a little over 2 kilos. in
weight, was injected with 7 mgrms. of cobra venom per kilo., and then 10
mgrms. of monobromated camphor were administered. In fifteen minutes
there was general paralysis of the limbs, from which in a few minutes
the animal seemed to recover; thirty minutes after the injection there
were no very evident symptoms, but within forty minutes there was a
sudden accession of convulsions, and death. Experiments were also made
with chloroform, morphine, and many other substances, but none seemed to
exercise any true antidotal effect.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_645" id="Sect_645"></a>&sect; 645. <b>Detection of the Cobra Venom.</b>&mdash;In an experiment on a
rabbit, the animal was killed by the subcutaneous injection of 8 mgrms.
per kilo. of the cobra poison. Immediately after death, 2 c.c. of the
blood were injected into a small rabbit; in fifteen minutes there was
slow respiration with pains in the limbs; in thirty minutes this had, in
a great measure, passed off, and in a little time the animal was well. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
any case in which it is necessary to attempt to separate the cobra venom,
the most likely method of succeeding would be to make a cold alcoholic
extract, evaporate in a vacuum, take up the residue in a little water, and
test its effect on small animals.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_646" id="Sect_646"></a>&sect; 646. <b>Duboia Russellii.</b>&mdash;The <i>Duboia russellii</i> or <i>Russell&#8217;s viper</i> is
one of the best known and most deadly of the Indian vipers. The
effects of the poison of this viper are altogether different from those of
the cobra. The action commences by violent general convulsions, which
are often at once fatal, or may be followed by rapid paralysis and death;
or these symptoms, again, may be recovered from, and death follow at a
later period. The convulsions do not depend on asphyxia, and with a
small dose may be absent. The paralysis is general, and may precede
for some time the extinction of the respiration, the pupils are widely
dilated, there are bloody discharges, and the urine is albuminous.
Should the victim survive the first effects, then blood-poisoning may
follow, and a dangerous illness result, often attended with copious
h&aelig;morrhages. A striking example of this course is recorded in the
<i>Indian Med. Gaz.</i>, June 1, 1872.</p>

<p>A Mahommedan, aged 40, was bitten on the finger by Russell&#8217;s viper;
the bitten part was soon after excised, and stimulants given. The hand
and arm became much swollen, and on the same day he passed blood by
the rectum, and also bloody urine. The next day he was sick, and still
passing blood from all the channels; in this state he remained eight days,
losing blood constantly, and died on the ninth day. Nothing definite is
known of the chemical composition of the poison; it is probably qualitatively
identical with &#8220;viperin.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="Sect_647" id="Sect_647"></a>&sect; 647. <b>The Poison of the Common Viper.</b>&mdash;The common viper still
abounds in certain parts of Great Britain, as, for example, on Dartmoor.
The venom was analysed in a partial manner by Valentin. In 1843
Prince Lucien Bonaparte separated a gummy varnish, inodorous, glittering,
and transparent, which he called <i>echidnin</i> or <i>viperin</i>; it was a neutral
nitrogenous body without taste, it arrested the coagulation of the blood,
and, injected into animals, produced all the effects of the bite of the
viper. Phisalix and G. Bertrand have studied the symptoms produced
in small animals after injection. A guinea-pig, weighing 500 grms.,
was killed by 0&middot;3 grm. of the dried venom dissolved in 5000 parts of
saline water; the symptoms were nausea, quickly passing into stupor.
The temperature of the body fell. The autopsy showed the left auricle
full of blood, the intestine, lungs, liver, and kidneys injected. The blood
of the viper is also poisonous, and produces the same symptoms as the
venom.<a name="FNanchor_652" id="FNanchor_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> The same observers have shown (<i>Compt. rend.</i>, cxviii., Jan.
1894) that the blood of the water-snake (<i>Tropidonotus natrix</i>) and of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
Thuringian adder (<i>Tropidonotus viperinus</i>) is poisonous, producing the
same symptoms as that of the viper.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p><b>The Venom of Naja Haje</b> (<b>Cleopatra&#8217;s Asp</b>).&mdash;It has been stated
that 20,000 persons annually die in Ceylon from the bite of Cleopatra&#8217;s
asp. Graziani (<i>Rif. Med.</i>, October 7, 1893) has undertaken a physiological
study of the venom, which has already received attention at the
hands of Calmette, Wall and Armstrong, Weir Mitchell, Reichardt, and
others. The venom, when dried, appears as transparent scales, easily
soluble in water, very slightly so in alcohol, ether, or chloroform; its
aqueous solution has an unpleasant odour, and is neutral to test paper.
Chemically it gives all the tests described by Weir Mitchell and others
as characteristic of the venom of <i>Naja tripudians</i>. The physiological
effects of this dried venom were tried on guinea-pigs, rabbits, and frogs,
to all of which it proved fatal in extremely minute doses. The guinea-pig,
a few seconds after injection, becomes paralysed in its hind limbs,
it foams at the mouth, and makes violent attempts at vomiting. The
eyes are half closed, but occasionally for short periods there is a partial
disappearance of the paralysis, and the animal makes feeble attempts to
support itself. Respiratory embarrassment is soon added to the foregoing
symptoms, and the animal lies perfectly prone, devoting all its attention
to breathing, which is rendered still more difficult by the vomiting and
frothy saliva which is secreted in abundance. Finally death ensues from
asphyxia. The <i>post-mortem</i> examination reveals the heart still feebly
beating, the lungs pallid, and the blood in the organs very dark. The
liver and kidneys are hyper&aelig;mic, but the brain and cord, with their
coverings, are an&aelig;mic. In the rabbit the course of the poisoning is
practically identical with that described above. Histologically, the following
facts are made out in addition to the foregoing. The red blood-corpuscles
are in great measure broken down, and there are also effusions
into the muscular tissues. The kidneys are very hyper&aelig;mic, and there
is marked degeneration of the epithelium lining the glomeruli and convoluted
tubules. The glomerular capsules are much distended, and
numerous leucocytes are discernible throughout the organ. The liver,
also, is hyper&aelig;mic, and shows numerous broken-down blood-corpuscles,
and partial necrosis of many of the liver cells. Examination of the
central nervous system reveals no particular changes.</p>

<h3>DIVISION II.&mdash;PTOMAINES&mdash;TOXINES.</h3>

<p><a name="Sect_648" id="Sect_648"></a>&sect; 648. <b>Definition of a Ptomaine.</b>&mdash;A ptomaine may be considered as
a basic chemical substance derived from the action of bacteria on nitrogenous
substances. If this definition is accepted, a ptomaine is not
necessarily formed in the dead animal tissue; it may be produced by
the living, and, in all cases, it is the product of bacterial life. A ptomaine
is not necessarily poisonous; many are known which are, in moderate
doses, quite innocuous.</p>

<p>When Selmi&#8217;s researches were first published there was some anxiety
lest the existence of ptomaines would seriously interfere with the detection
of poison generally, because some were said to be like strychnine, others
like colchicine, and so forth. Farther research has conclusively shown
that at present no ptomaine is known which so closely resembles a vegetable
poison as to be likely in skilled hands to cause confusion.</p>

<p>In this way pyrrol, skatol, phenol, indol, and volatile fatty acids are
separated and will be found in the distillate. The residue in the retort
is treated with lime, filtered from the precipitate that forms, and distilled
in a vacuum, the distillate being received in weak sulphuric acid. The
bases accompanied with ammonia distil over. The distillate is now
neutralised by sulphuric acid<a name="FNanchor_654" id="FNanchor_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> and evaporated nearly to dryness, separating
the mother liquid from sulphate of ammonia, which crystallises out. The
mother liquids are treated with absolute alcohol, which dissolves the
sulphates of the ptomaines. The alcohol is got rid of by evaporation, the
residue treated with caustic soda, and the bases shaken out by successive
treatment with ether, petroleum ether, and chloroform. The residue remaining
in the retort with the excess of lime is dried, powdered, and
exhausted with ether; the ethereal extract is separated, evaporated to
dryness, the dry residue taken up in a little water, slightly acidulated,
and the bases precipitated by an alkali.</p>

<img src="images/illo521.png" alt="Bocklisch apparatus" width="150" height="326" />
</div>

<p>&#8220;The insoluble portion is filtered off, and the filtrate evaporated, either
in the gas-oven or on the water-bath, to syrupy consistency. If the
substances are offensive, as alcoholic and watery
extracts of flesh usually are, the use of Bocklisch&#8217;s
simple apparatus (see <a href="#Fig_521">diagram</a>) is to be recommended.
The filtrate to be evaporated is placed
in a flask provided with a doubly perforated
caoutchouc cork carrying two bent tubes; the
tube <i>b</i> terminates near the bottom of the flask,
while the tube <i>a</i> terminates a little above the
level of the fluid to be evaporated. The tube <i>a</i>
is connected with a water pump which sucks away
the escaping steam. In order to avoid the running
back of the condensed water forming in the cooler
part of the tube, the end of the tube <i>a</i> is twisted into
a circular form. Through the tube <i>b</i>, which has a
fine capillary bore, a stream of air is allowed to
enter, which keeps the fluid in constant agitation,
continually destroying the scum on the surface,
and avoiding sediments collecting at the bottom, which may cause fracture
of the flask. According to the regulation of the air current, a greater or
smaller vacuum can be produced. The fluid, evaporated to the consistency
of a syrup, is treated with 96 per cent. alcohol, filtered, and the
filtrate precipitated with lead acetate.</p>

<p>&#8220;The lead precipitate is filtered off, the filtrate evaporated to a syrup,
and the syrup again treated with 96 per cent. alcohol. This is again
filtered, the alcohol got rid of by evaporation, water added, the lead
thrown down by <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>, and the fluid, after the addition of a little
hydrochloric acid, evaporated to the consistence of a syrup; this syrup is
exhausted with 96 per cent. alcohol, and precipitated with an alcoholic
solution of mercury chloride. The mercury precipitate is boiled with
water, and by the different solubility of the mercury salts of certain
ptomaines some separation takes place. If it is suspected that some of
the ptomaines may have been separated with the lead precipitate, this
lead precipitate can be decomposed by <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span> and investigated. I have
only (says Brieger) in the case of mussels been able to extract from the
lead precipitate small quantities of ptomaines.</p>

<p>&#8220;The mercury filtrate is freed from mercury and evaporated, the excess
of hydrochloric acid being carefully neutralised by means of soda (for it
must only be slightly acid); then it is again treated with alcohol, so as to
separate as much as possible the inorganic constituents. The alcoholic extract<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
is evaporated, dissolved in a little water, neutralised with soda,
acidulated with nitric acid, and precipitated with phospho-molybdic acid.
The phospho-molybdic acid precipitate is decomposed with neutral lead
acetate, which process may be facilitated by heating on the water-bath.
After getting rid of the lead by treatment with <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>, the fluid is evaporated
to a syrup and alcohol added, by which process many ptomaines may be
eliminated as hydrochlorates; or they can be converted into double salts (of
platinum or gold) for the purpose of separation. In the filtrate from phospho-molybdate,
ptomaines may also be found by treating with lead acetate
to get rid of the phospho-molybdic acid, and then adding certain reactives.
Since it is but seldom that the hydrochlorates are obtained in a state of
purity, it is preferable to convert the substance separated into a gold or
platinum salt or a picrate, since the greater or less solubility of these
compounds facilitates the purification of individual members; but which
reagent is best to add, must be learned from experience. The melting-point
of these salts must always be taken, so that an idea of their purity
may be obtained. It is also to be noted that many gold salts decompose
on warming the aqueous solution; this may be avoided by the addition
of hydrochloric acid. The hydrochlorates of the ptomaines are obtained
by decomposing the mercury, gold, or platinum combinations by the aid
of <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>, while the picrates can be treated with hydrochloric acid and
shaken up with ether, which latter solvent dissolves the picric acid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Considerable difficulty in the purification of the ptomaines is caused by
a nitrogenous, amorphous, non-poisonous, albumin-like substance, which
passes into all solutions, and can only be got rid of by careful precipitation
with an alcoholic solution of lead acetate, in which it is soluble in
excess. This albuminoid forms an amorphous compound with platinum,
and acts as a strongly reducing agent (the platinum compound contains
29 per cent. platinum). When this albuminoid is eliminated, then the
hydrochlorates or the double salts of the ptomaines crystallise.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="Sect_651" id="Sect_651"></a>&sect; 651. <b>The Benzoyl Chloride Method.</b>&mdash;The fatty diamines in dilute
aqueous solutions, shaken with benzoyl chloride and soda, are converted

which contain two amido groups combined with one and the

benzoyl chloride and soda. Hence this reaction can be utilised for certain
of the ptomaines only. The solution must be dilute, because concentrated
solutions of creatine, creatinine, and similar bodies also give
precipitates with benzoyl chloride; no separation, however, occurs unless
these bodies are in the proportion of five per thousand.</p>

<p>The operation is performed by making the liquid alkaline with soda,
so that the alkalinity is equal to about 10 per cent., adding benzoyl
chloride, shaking until the odour of benzoyl chloride disappears, and then
filtering; to the filtrate more benzoyl chloride is added, the liquid
shaken, and, if a precipitate appears, this is also filtered off, and the
process repeated until all diamines are separated.</p>

<p>The precipitate thus obtained is dissolved in alcohol, and the alcoholic
solution poured into a considerable volume of water and allowed to stand
over night; the dibenzoyl compound is then usually found to be in a
crystalline condition. The compound is crystallised once or twice from
alcohol or ether, and its melting-point and properties studied. Mixtures
of diamines may be separated by their different solubilities in ether and
alcohol.</p>

<p>A solution of 0&middot;00788 grm. of pentamethylenediamine in 100 c.c. of

<p><a name="Sect_652" id="Sect_652"></a>&sect; 652. <b>The Amines.</b>&mdash;The amines are bases originating from ammonia
and built on the same type. Those that are interesting as poisons are
monamines, diamines, and the quaternary ammonium bases.</p>

<p>Considered as compound ammonias, the amines are divided into
primary or amide bases, secondary or imid bases, and tertiary or nitrile
bases, according as to whether one, two, or three atoms of hydrogen
have been displaced from the ammonia molecule by an alkyl; for
instance, methylamine <span class="chemform">NH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub></span> is a primary or amide base, because only
one of the three atoms of H in <span class="chemform">NH<sub>3</sub></span> has been replaced by methyl;
similarly, dimethylamine is a secondary or imid base, and trimethylamine
is a tertiary or nitrile base.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span></p>

<p>The quaternary bases are derived from the hypothetical ammonium
hydroxide <span class="chemform">NH<sub>4</sub>OH</span>, as, for example, tetraethyl ammonium hydroxide
<span class="chemform">(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>N,OH</span>.</p>

<p>The diamines are derived from two molecules of <span class="chemform">NH</span>, and therefore
contain, instead of one molecule of nitrogen, two molecules of nitrogen;
in two molecules of ammonia there are six atoms of hydrogen, two, four,
or six of which may be replaced by alkyls; as, for example,</p>

<p>The monamines are similar to ammonia in their reactions; some of
them are stronger bases; for instance, ethylamine expels ammonia from its
salts. The first members of the series are combustible gases of pungent
odour, and easily soluble in water; the higher homologues are fluids;
and the still higher members solids.</p>

<p>The hydrochlorides are soluble in absolute alcohol, while chloride of
ammonium is insoluble; this property is taken advantage of for separating
amines from ammonia. The amines form double salts with platinic
chloride; this is also utilised for recognition, for the purpose of separation,
and for purification; for instance, ammonium-platinum-chloride on
ignition yields 43&middot;99 per cent. of platinum, and methylamine-platinum-chloride
yields 47&middot;4 of platinum. It is comparatively easy to ascertain
whether an amine is primary, secondary, or tertiary.</p>

<p>The primary and secondary amines react with nitrous acid, but not
the tertiary; the primary amines, for instance, are converted into
alcohols, and there is an evolution of nitrogen gas; thus methylamine is
decomposed into methyl alcohol, nitrogen, and water.</p>

<p class="chemreact">CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>2</sub> + (OH)NO = CH<sub>3</sub>(OH) + N<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

<p>The secondary amines, treated in the same way, evolve no nitrogen,
but are converted into nitrosamines; thus dimethylamine, when treated
with nitrous acid, yields nitrosodimethylamine,</p>

<p class="chemreact">(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NH + (OH)NO = (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(NO)N + H<sub>2</sub>O;</p>

<p>and the nitrosamines respond to the test known as Lieberman&#8217;s nitroso-reaction,
which is thus performed:&mdash;The substance is dissolved in
phenol and a few drops of concentrated sulphuric acid added. The
yellow colour at first produced changes into blue by adding to the
acid liquid a solution of potash.</p>

<p>The primary amines, and the primary amines alone, treated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
chloroform and alcoholic potash, yield the peculiarly offensive smelling
carbylamine or isonitrile (Hofmann&#8217;s test),</p>

<p>Where a sufficient quantity of an amine is obtained, the primary,
secondary, or tertiary character of the amine may be deduced with
certainty by treating it with methyl or ethyl iodide.</p>

<p>A molecule of the base is digested with a molecule of methyl iodide
and distilled with potash; the distillate is in the same manner again
treated with methyl iodide and again distilled; and the process is
repeated until an ammonium base is obtained, which will take up no
more iodide. If three methyl groups were in this way introduced, the
original substance was primary, if two, secondary, if one, tertiary.</p>

<p>The quaternary bases, such as tetraethyl ammoniumoxhydrate, decompose,
on heating, into triethylamine and ethylene; the corresponding
methyl compound in like manner yields trimethylamine and methyl-alcohol.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the primary, secondary, and tertiary bases do not
decompose on heating, but volatilise without decomposition.</p>

<p>It forms crystalline salts, such as, for example, the hydrochloride, the platinochloride
(Pt = 41&middot;4 per cent.), and the aurochloride (Au = 53&middot;3 per cent. when anhydrous).

<p>In Brieger&#8217;s process it may occur in both the mercuric chloride precipitate and filtrate.
From cadaverine it may be separated by platinum chloride; cadaverine platinochloride
is with difficulty soluble in cold water and crystallises from hot water, while
dimethylamine remains in the mother liquor. From choline it may be separated by
recrystallising the mercuric precipitate from hot water. From methylamine it may
be separated by converting into chloride and extracting with chloroform; dimethylamine

the mercury chloride precipitate:&mdash;gadinine, neuridine, a base isomeric with
ethylenediamine <span class="chemform">C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>8</sub>N<sub>2</sub></span> (but which Brieger subsequently more or less satisfactorily
identified with ethylidenediamine), muscarine, and triethylamine; these
bases were separated as follows:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The filtrate from the mercury chloride solution was freed from mercury by <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>,
evaporated to a syrup, and then extracted with alcohol. From the alcoholic solution
platinum chloride precipitated neuridine, this was filtered off, the filtrate freed
from alcohol and platinum, and the aqueous solution concentrated to a small volume
and precipitated with an aqueous solution of platinum chloride; this precipitated
ethylidene platinum chloride. The mother liquor from this precipitate was concentrated
on the water-bath, and, on cooling, the platinochloride of muscarine crystallised
out. From the mother liquor (freed from the crystals), on standing in a
desiccator, the gadinine double salt crystallised out, and from the mother liquor
(freed from gadinine after removal of the platinum by <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>) distillation with <span class="chemform">KHO</span>
recovered trimethylamine.</p>

<p>From the platinochloride of ethylenediamine, the chloride can be obtained by
treating with <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>, filtering, and evaporating; by distilling the chloride with a
caustic alkali, the free base can be obtained by distillation.</p>

<p>Ethylidenediamine is isomeric with ethylenediamine, but differs from it in the
following properties:&mdash;ethylidenediamine is poisonous, ethylenediamine is non-poisonous.</p>

<p>Ethylenediamine forms a platinochloride almost insoluble in hot water, while the
ethylidene salt is more easily soluble. The properties of the gold salts are similar,
ethylenediamine forming a difficultly soluble gold salt, ethylidene a rather soluble
gold salt.</p>

<p>Ethylidenediamine forms a hydrochloride, <span class="chemform">C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>8</sub>N<sub>2</sub>2HCl</span>, crystallising in long
glistening needles, insoluble in absolute alcohol, rather soluble in water. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493"><span class="fsize110">[493]</span></a></span>
hydrochloride gives precipitates in aqueous solution with phospho-molybdic acid,
phospho-antimonic acid, and potassium bismuth iodide; the latter is in the form of
red plates.</p>

<p>The platinochloride, <span class="chemform">C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>8</sub>N<sub>2</sub>2HCl.PtCl</span> (Pt = 41&middot;5 per cent.), is in the form of
yellow plates, not very soluble in cold water.</p>

</div><!--blockquote-->

<p>Ethylidenediamine, when subcutaneously injected into guinea-pigs,
produces an abundant secretion from the mucous membranes of the
nose, mouth, and eyes. The pupils dilate, and the eyeballs project.
There is acute dyspn&#339;a; death takes place after some twenty-four
hours, and the heart is stopped in diastole.</p>

<p>Trimethylenediamine is believed to have been isolated by Brieger from
cultivations in beef broth of the comma bacillus.</p>

<p>It occurs in small quantity in the mercuric chloride precipitate, and
is isolated by decomposing the precipitate with <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>, evaporating the
filtrate from the mercury sulphide to dryness, taking up the residue
with absolute alcohol, and precipitating by an alcoholic solution of
sodium picrate. The precipitate contains the picrate of trimethylenediamine,
mixed with the picrates of cadaverine and creatinine. Cadaverine
picrate is insoluble in boiling absolute alcohol, the other picrates
soluble; so the mixed picrates are boiled with absolute alcohol, and the
insoluble cadaverine filtered off. Next, the picrates of creatinine and
trimethylenediamine are freed from alcohol, the solution in water acidified
with hydrochloric acid, the picric acid shaken out by treatment with
ether, and then the solution precipitated with platinum chloride; the
platinochloride of trimethylenediamine is not very soluble, while creatinine
easily dissolves; so that separation is by this means fairly easy.</p>

<p>It also gives a difficultly soluble salt with gold chloride.</p>

<p>The picrate consists of felted needles, melting-point 198&deg;. Phospho-molybdic
acid gives a precipitate crystallising in plates; potassium
bismuth iodide gives dark coloured needles.</p>

<p>It produces in animals violent convulsions and muscular tremors;
but the substance has hitherto been obtained in too small a quantity
to be certain as to its identification and properties.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_663" id="Sect_663"></a>&sect; 663. <b>Neuridine</b>, <span class="chemform">C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>14</sub>N<sub>2</sub></span>.&mdash;Neuridine is a diamine, and is apparently
the most common basic product of putrefaction; it has been obtained
from the putrefaction of gelatin, of horseflesh, of fish, and from the yelk
of eggs. It is usually accompanied by choline, from which it can be
separated by converting the bases into hydrochlorides, choline hydrochloride
being soluble in absolute alcohol, neuridine scarcely so. Brieger
isolated neuridine from putrid flesh by precipitating the watery extract
with mercuric chloride. He decomposed the mercury precipitate with
<span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>, and, after having got rid of the sulphide of mercury by filtration,
he concentrated the liquid to a small bulk, when a substance separated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
in crystals similar in form to urea; this was purified by recrystallisation
from absolute alcohol, and converted into the platinum salt.</p>

<p>Another method which may be used for the separation and purification
of neuridine is to dissolve it in alcohol and precipitate with an alcoholic

<p>When cadaverine is treated with methyl iodide, two atoms of hydrogen
may be replaced with methyl, forming the base <span class="chemform">C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>12</sub>(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub></span>; the
platinochloride of this last base crystallises in long red needles.</p>

<p>Cadaverine forms well-defined crystalline salts as well as compounds
with metals.</p>

<p>Cadaverine hydrochloride, <span class="chemform">C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>14</sub>N<sub>2</sub>2HCl</span>, crystallises in needles which
are deliquescent, or it may be obtained from an alcoholic solution in plates.
The crystals are insoluble in absolute alcohol, but readily soluble in 96
per cent. alcohol. Putrescine hydrochloride, on the other hand, is with
difficulty soluble in alcohol of that strength; hence the two hydrochlorides
can be separated by taking advantage of their difference in
solubility in 96 per cent. alcohol; but the better method for separation
is the benzoyl-chloride process (<a href="#Page_487">p. 487</a>). On dry distillation, cadaverine
hydrochloride decomposes into <span class="chemform">NH<sub>3</sub>,HCl</span> and piperidine <span class="chemform">C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>11</sub>N</span>. The

cent.); melting-point, 214&deg;-216&deg;&mdash;is insoluble in alcohol and in cold
water; this property is also useful to separate it from putrescine, the
mercury compound of which is soluble in cold water. The platinochloride,
<span class="chemform">C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>14</sub>N<sub>2</sub>2HCl,PtCl<sub>4</sub></span> (Pt = 38&middot;08 per cent.), crystallises in dirty
red needles; but, by repeated crystallisation, it may be obtained
in clear chrome yellow, short, octahedral prisms; it is soluble with
difficulty in hot water, insoluble in cold water. The salt decomposes
at 235&deg;-236&deg;.</p>

<p>The aurochloride&mdash;<span class="chemform">C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>14</sub>N<sub>2</sub>2HCl2AuCl</span> (Au = 50&middot;41 per cent.), melting-point
188&deg;&mdash;crystallises partly in cubes and partly in needles, and is easily

soluble in ether, insoluble in water.</p>

<p>It is not acted on by hot dilute acids or alkalis, and when dissolved in
concentrated hydrochloric acid and alcohol it is, only after prolonged
boiling, decomposed into benzoic acid and the free base. The benzoic
acid after getting rid of the alcohol by evaporation, can be removed by
shaking up with ether; then the hydrochloride can be decomposed by an
alkali and the free base obtained, or the platinum salt of cadaverine may
be formed by precipitation with platinum chloride. Should cadaverine and
putrescine be in the same liquid, the dibenzoyl compounds may be separated
as follows:&mdash;the crystalline precipitate is collected on a filter, washed
with water until the filtrate runs clear, and then dissolved in warm
alcohol; this solution is poured into twenty times its volume of ether and
allowed to stand; after a short time crystals form of the putrescine compound,
which are far less soluble in alcohol than those of cadaverine
dibenzoyl; these crystals are filtered off and repeatedly crystallised from
alcohol until the melting-point is about 175&deg;-176&deg;. The filtrate contains
the cadaverine compound; this latter is recovered by evaporating off
the ether-alcohol.</p>

<p>The free base is a clear liquid, with a semen-like odour, boiling-point 135&deg;.
It is a common base in putrefying animal substances, and also occurs in

<p>The best method of separating putrescine is the benzoyl chloride method

before, it is less soluble in alcohol than the corresponding compound
of cadaverine.</p>

<p>Putrescine is not poisonous. On the other hand, by repeated treatment
with methyl iodide, it takes up four methyl radicals, and the tetramethyl

<p>A method of separating guanidine from urine has been worked out by
Gergers and Baumann.<a name="FNanchor_668" id="FNanchor_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> The principle of the method is based upon
the fact that guanidine is precipitated by mercurous oxide. The
urine is precipitated by hydrate of baryta, the precipitate filtered
off, the alkaline filtrate neutralised by hydrochloric acid, and the
neutral filtrate evaporated to a syrup on the water-bath; the syrup
is exhausted by absolute alcohol, and the alcoholic solution filtered;
this filtrate is freed from alcohol by distillation, the alcohol-free
residue dissolved in a little water, shaken up with freshly precipitated
mercury oxide, and allowed to stand for two days in a warm
place; the precipitate formed is collected, acidulated with <span class="chemform">HCl</span> and
treated with <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>; the mercury sulphide thus obtained is separated by
filtration, the filtrate evaporated, and the residue dissolved in absolute
alcohol. This solution is precipitated by platinum chloride, filtered,
separated from any platinum ammonium salt, and evaporated to a small
volume. After long standing the guanidine salt crystallises out. The
best method to identify it appears to be, to ascertain the absence of
ammonia and of urea, and then to gently warm the supposed guanidine
with an alkali, which breaks guanidine up into ammonia and urea,
according to the following equation:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

in absolute alcohol; it melts at 225&deg; with effervescence, and
contains 31&middot;6 per cent. of platinum. The mercurochloride is soluble with
difficulty even in hot water. The aurochloride (Au = 44&middot;5 per cent.) is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
crystalline, and with difficulty soluble in cold water; but is soluble in hot
water and in alcohol; melting-point 264&deg; with decomposition.</p>

<p>Choline is only poisonous in large doses.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_675" id="Sect_675"></a>&sect; 675. <b>Neurine</b> (Trimethyl-vinyl-ammonium hydrate), <span class="chemform">C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>N(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>OH</span>.&mdash;Neurine
is one of the products of decomposition of choline. It is
poisonous, and has been separated by Brieger and others from decomposing
animal matters. In Brieger&#8217;s process, neurine, if present, will be for
the most part in the mercuric chloride precipitate, and some portion will
also be in the filtrate. The mercury precipitate is decomposed by <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>,
the mercury sulphide filtered off, and the filtrate, concentrated, treated
with absolute alcohol and then precipitated by platinum chloride. It is
usually accompanied by choline; the platinochloride of choline is readily
soluble in water, neurine platinochloride is soluble with difficulty; this
property is taken advantage of, and the platinochloride crystallised from
water until pure. Neurine has a strong alkaline reaction.</p>

<p>Neurine chloride, <span class="chemform">C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>12</sub>N.Cl</span>, crystallises in fine needles. The platinochloride,
<span class="chemform">(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>12</sub>NCl)<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>4</sub></span> (Pt = 33&middot;6 per cent.), crystallises in
octahedra. The salt is soluble with difficulty in hot water.</p>

<p>The aurochloride, <span class="chemform">C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>12</sub>NClAuCl<sub>3</sub></span> (Au = 46&middot;37 per cent.), forms flat
prisms, which, according to Brieger, are soluble with difficulty in hot water.</p>

<p>Neurine is intensely poisonous, the symptoms being similar to those
produced by muscarine.</p>

<p>Atropine is an antidote to neurine, relieving in suitable doses the
effects, and even rendering animals temporarily immune against the toxic
action of neurine.</p>

<p>When a fatal dose of neurine is injected into a frog there is in a short
time paralysis of the extremities. The respiration stops first, and afterwards
the heart, the latter in diastole.</p>

<p>The symptoms in rabbits are profuse nasal secretion and salivation
with paralysis, as in frogs. Applied to the eye, neurine causes contraction
of the pupil; to a less degree the same effect is produced by the
ingestion of neurine.</p>

neurine, but the action is less powerful.&mdash;V. Cervello, <i>Arch. Ital. Biol.</i>,

as large deliquescent crystals; the reaction of the crystals is neutral.
Distilled with potash, trimethylamine and other bases are formed.</p>

<p>Betaine chloride, <span class="chemform">C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>12</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>Cl</span>, forms plates permanent in the air and
insoluble in absolute alcohol. A solution of the chloride in water gives,
with potassium mercuric iodide, a light yellow or whitish yellow precipitate,
soluble in excess; but, on rubbing the sides of the tube with a
glass rod, the oily precipitate crystallises as yellow needles; probably
this is characteristic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span></p>

<p>The aurochloride (Au = 43&middot;1 percent.) forms fine cholesterine plates,

juice moist fibrin for twenty-four hours at blood heat. The liquid was
evaporated to a syrup and boiled with ethylic alcohol, the ethylic
alcohol was evaporated, the residue digested with amylic alcohol, and
the amyl alcohol in its turn evaporated to dryness; the residue was a
brown amorphous mass that was poisonous. It was farther purified by
treating the extract with neutral lead acetate and then filtered; the
filtrate was freed from lead by <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span> and treated with ether, the ethereal
extract being then separated and evaporated to dryness; this last residue
was taken up with amyl alcohol, the alcohol evaporated to dryness, and
the residue finally taken up with water and filtered. The filtrate is
poisonous. The poisonous substance, to which Brieger gave the provisional
name of peptotoxine, is a very stable substance, resisting
the action of a boiling temperature, and even the action of strong alkalies.
It gives precipitates with alkaloidal group reagents, and strikes a
blue colour with ferric chloride and ferricyanide of potassium. The
most characteristic test seems to be its action with Millon&#8217;s reagent
(a solution of mercury nitrate in nitric acid containing nitrous acid);
this gives a white precipitate which, on boiling, becomes intensely red.</p>

<p>It is poisonous, killing rabbits in doses of 0&middot;5 grm. per kilogrm., with
symptoms of paralysis and coma. The nature of this substance requires
further elucidation.</p>

the formula <span class="chemform">C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>11</sub>N</span>, in the form of a yellow, mobile, strongly odorous
liquid, very soluble in alcohol, ether, and acetone, boiling-point 202&deg;.
It quickly absorbs moisture from the air. It forms two mercuric
chlorides, one of which has the formula <span class="chemform">(C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>11</sub>N,HCl)<sub>2</sub>HgCl<sub>2</sub></span>; this
compound crystallises in small white needles, slightly soluble in water
and dilute alcohol, but insoluble in absolute alcohol, and decomposing
when exposed to moist air. The other salt is a sesqui-salt, forming
long yellowish needles, insoluble in ordinary solvents, and decomposing
when exposed to moist air. The alkaloid also forms deliquescent very
soluble salts with hydrochloric and hydrobromic acids. A platinum
salt is also formed, <span class="chemform">(C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>11</sub>N)<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub></span>; it is of a deep yellow colour,
almost insoluble in cold, but soluble in hot water; it is decomposed
by boiling water, with the formation of a very insoluble compound
in the shape of a brown powder, <span class="chemform">(C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>11</sub>N)<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>4</sub></span>. Coninck&#8217;s alkaloid,
on oxidation with potassic permanganate, yields a gummy acid; this
acid, on purifying it by conversion into a potassium salt and then into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
a cupric salt, was found to be nicotinic acid; so that the alkaloid is
undoubtedly a pyridine compound; indeed, the acid, distilled with lime,
yields pyridine.</p>

a base of unknown composition, to which he gave the name of &#8220;spasmotoxine.&#8221;
It was produced in cultures of the tetanus bacillus in beef broth.</p>

<p>Two more definite substances have also been discovered, viz., tetanine
and tetanotoxine.</p>

<p><b>Tetanine</b>, <span class="chemform">C<sub>13</sub>H<sub>30</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub></span>, is best isolated by the method of Kitasato and

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>The broth is digested with 0&middot;25 per cent. <span class="chemform">HCl</span> for some hours at
460&deg;, then rendered feebly alkaline, and distilled in a vacuum. The
residue in the retort is then worked up for tetanine by Brieger&#8217;s
method; the distillate contains tetanotoxine, ammonia, indol, hydrogen
sulphide, phenol, and butyric acid. On treating the contents of the
retort by Brieger&#8217;s mercury chloride method, the filtrate contains most
of the poison. The mercury is removed by <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>, the filtered solution
evaporated and exhausted by absolute alcohol, in which the tetanine
dissolves. Any ammonium chloride is thus separated, ammonium
chloride being insoluble in absolute alcohol. The alcoholic solution,
filtered from any insoluble substance, is next treated with an alcoholic
solution of platinum chloride, which precipitates creatinine (and any
ammonium salts), but does not precipitate tetanine. The platinum
salt of tetanine may, however, be precipitated by the addition of ether
to the alcoholic solution. The platinum salt, as obtained by precipitation
from ether, is very deliquescent; it has, therefore, to be rapidly
filtered off and dried in a vacuum. It can then be recrystallised from
hot 96 per cent. alcohol, forming clear yellow plates; these plates, if
dried in a vacuum, become with difficulty soluble in water.</p>

<p>Tetanine may be obtained as a free base by treating the hydrochloride
with freshly precipitated moist silver oxide. It forms a strongly alkaline
yellow syrup, and is easily decomposed in acid solution, but is permanent
in alkaline solutions.</p>

<p>The platinochloride, as before observed, is precipitable by ether from
alcoholic solution; it contains 28&middot;3 per cent. of platinum, and decomposes
at 197&deg;.</p>

<p>The base produces tetanus.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_680" id="Sect_680"></a>&sect; 680. <b>Tetanotoxine</b> may be distilled, and be found in the distillate

melting-point about 205&deg;.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span></p>

horse-flesh in a putrefactive condition and other substances. It is found
in the mercury chloride precipitate. The free base is an alkaline syrup,
isomeric with the base separated by Brieger from tetanus cultures. The
hydrochloride is a deliquescent syrup, not forming any compound with
gold chloride, but uniting with phospho-molybdic acid in forming a
compound crystallising in cubes. It forms a double salt with gold
chloride, sparingly soluble in water. The platinochloride (Pt = 29 per
cent.) is very soluble in water, but not soluble in alcohol; melting-point
193&deg; with decomposition.</p>

of mussels. Brieger isolated it as follows:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The mussels were boiled with water acidified by hydrochloric acid;
the liquid was filtered, and the filtrate evaporated to a syrup, and the
syrup was repeatedly extracted with alcohol. It was found advisable to
exhaust thoroughly with alcohol, otherwise much poison remained
behind. The alcoholic solution was treated with an alcoholic solution
of lead acetate. The filtrate was evaporated and the residue extracted
with alcohol. The lead was removed by <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>, the alcohol distilled off,
water added to the remaining syrup, and the solution decolorised by
boiling with animal charcoal. The solution was neutralised by sodium
carbonate, acidulated with nitric acid, and precipitated with phosphomolybdic
acid. The precipitate was then decomposed by warming with
a neutral solution of lead acetate, and the filtrate (after the removal of
the lead by the action of <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>) was acidulated with <span class="chemform">HCl</span> and evaporated
to dryness. The residue was then extracted with absolute alcohol,
filtered from any insoluble chloride, <i>e.g.</i>, betaine chloride, and precipitated
by mercury chloride in alcohol.</p>

<p>The free base has a most peculiar odour, which disappears on exposure
to air; at the same time, the poisonous properties also diminish. The base
is destroyed by boiling with sodium carbonate; on the other hand, the
hydrochloride may be evaporated to dryness or be boiled without decomposing.</p>

<p>The hydrochloride crystallises in tetrahedra; the aurochloride crystallises
in cubes (Au=41&middot;66 per cent.). Its melting-point is 182&deg;.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_683" id="Sect_683"></a>&sect; 683. <b>Tyrotoxicon</b> (Diazobenzol, <span class="chemform">C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N<sub>2</sub>(OH)</span>).&mdash;It appears, from
the researches of Vaughan and others, that diazobenzol is liable to be
formed in milk and milk products, especially in summer time. It is
confidently asserted by many that the summer diarrh&#339;a of infants is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
due to this toxine; however that may be, it is well established that
diazobenzol is a violent poison, causing sickness, diarrh&#339;a, and, in large
doses, an acute malady scarcely distinguishable from cholera, and which
may end fatally. There will always be difficulty in detecting it, because
of its instability. The following is the best process of extraction from
milk. The milk will probably be acid from decomposition; if so, the
whey must be separated by dilution and filtration; without dilution it
may be found impracticable to get a clear filtrate. In order to keep the
bulk down, 25 c.c. of the milk may be diluted up to 100 c.c., and,
having obtained a clear filtrate from this 25 c.c. thus diluted, the filtrate
is used to dilute another 25 c.c. of milk and so on. The acid filtrate is
neutralised by sodium carbonate, agitated with an equal volume of ether,
allowed to stand in a stoppered vessel for twenty-four hours, and the
ether then separated and allowed to evaporate spontaneously. The
residue is acidified with nitric acid and then treated with a saturated solution
of potash, which forms a stable compound with diazobenzol, and the
whole concentrated on the water-bath. On cooling, the tyrotoxicon
compound forms six-sided plates. Before the whole of this process is
undertaken, it is well to make a preliminary test of the milk as follows:&mdash;A
little of the ether is allowed to evaporate spontaneously. Place
on a porcelain slab two or three drops of a mixture of equal parts of
sulphuric and carbolic acids, and add a few drops of the aqueous solution;
if tyrotoxicon be present, a yellow to orange-red colour is produced.
A similar colour is also produced by nitrates or nitrites, which are
not likely to be present under the circumstances, milk having mere traces
only of nitrates or nitrites; it may also be due to butyric acid, which,
in a decomposed milk, may frequently be in solution. Therefore, if a
colour occurs, this is not absolutely conclusive; if, however, no colour is
produced, then it is certain that no diazobenzol has been separated.
That is all that can be said, for the process itself is faulty, and only
separates a fractional part of the whole.</p>

the quantity obtained in each case has, however, been, under the
most favourable circumstances, less than a gramme; often only a few
milligrms. To specifically declare that a few milligrms. of a substance
is a new body, requires immense experience and great skill; and, even
where those qualifications are present, this is too often impossible.
This being so, the long list of named ptomaines, such as erysipeline, varioline,

than one observer before they can be accepted as separate entities.</p>

<h3>DIVISION III.&mdash;FOOD POISONING.</h3>

<p><a name="Sect_686" id="Sect_686"></a>&sect; 686. A large number of cases of poisoning by food occur yearly;
some are detailed in the daily press; the great majority are neither
recorded in any journal, scientific or otherwise; nor, on account of their
slight and passing character, is medical aid sought. The greatest portion
of these cases are probably due to ptomaines existing in the food before
being consumed; others may be due to the action of unhealthy fermentation
in the intestinal canal itself; in a third class of cases, it is probable
that a true zymotic infection is conveyed and develops in the sufferer; the
latter class of cases, as, for instance, the Middlesborough epidemic of
pleuro-pneumonia, is outside the scope of this treatise.</p>

<p>Confining the attention to cases of food poisoning in which the
symptoms have been closely analysed and described, the reader is referred
to thirteen cases of food poisoning, investigated by the medical officers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
the Local Government Board between the years 1878 and 1891, as
follows:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1878. <b>A Case of Poisoning at Whitchurch from eating Roast Pork.</b>&mdash;Only
the leg of pork was poisonous, other parts eaten without injury.
Two persons died after about thirty hours&#8217; illness. The pork itself, on a
particular Sunday, was innocuous; it became poisonous between the
Sunday and the Monday; the toxicity appeared to gradually increase,
for those who ate it for dinner on the Monday were not taken ill for
periods of from seven to nineteen hours, while two persons who ate of it
in the evening were attacked four hours after eating.</p>

<p>1880. <b>The Welbeck Epidemic</b>, due to eating cold boiled ham. Over
fifty persons affected. Symptoms commenced in from twelve to forty-eight
hours.</p>

<p>1881. <b>A Series of Poisoning from eating Baked Pork, Nottingham.</b>&mdash;Probably
the gravy was the cause and not the pork itself. Many
persons seriously ill. One died.</p>

<p>1881. <b>Tinned American Sausage.</b>&mdash;A man in Chester died from
eating tinned American sausage. Poison found to be unequally distributed
in the sausage.</p>

<p>1882. <b>Poisoning at Oldham by Tinned Pigs&#8217; Tongues.</b>&mdash;Two families
affected. Symptoms commenced in about four hours. All recovered.
After a few days&#8217; keeping it would appear that the poison had been
decomposed.</p>

<p>1882. <b>A Family Poisoned by Roast Beef at Bishop Stortford.</b>&mdash;Only
a particular piece of the ribs seemed to be poisonous, the rest of the
carcase being innocuous. Symptoms did not commence until several
hours after ingestion.</p>

<p>1882. <b>Ten different Families at Whitchurch Poisoned by eating
Brawn.</b>&mdash;First symptoms after about four hours.</p>

<p>1884. <b>Tinned Salmon at Wolverhampton.</b>&mdash;Five persons, two being
children, ate of tinned salmon at Wolverhampton. All suffered more or
less. The mother&#8217;s symptoms began after twelve hours, and she died in
five days; the son died in three days, the symptoms commencing in ten
hours. The <i>post-mortem</i> signs were similar to those from phosphorus
poisoning, viz., fatty degeneration. Mice fed on the material also
suffered, and their organs showed a similar degeneration.</p>

<p>1886. <b>The Carlisle A Case.</b>&mdash;At a wedding breakfast in Carlisle
twenty-four persons were poisoned by food which had been kept in
an ill-ventilated cellar. The articles suspected were an American ham,
an open game pie, and certain jellies. The bride died. Symptoms commenced
in from six to forty-three hours.</p>

<p>1886. <b>Poisoning by Veal Pie at Iron Bridge.</b>&mdash;Twelve out of fifteen
ate of the pie; all were taken ill in from six to twelve hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span></p>

<p>1887. <b>Poisoning at Retford of Eighty Persons from eating Pork
Pie or Brawn.</b>&mdash;Symptoms commenced at various intervals, from eight
to thirty-six hours.</p>

<p>1889. <b>The Carlisle B Case.</b>&mdash;Poisoning by pork pies or boiled salt
pork. Number of persons attacked, about twenty-five.</p>

<p>1891. <b>Poisoning by a Meat Pie at Portsmouth.</b>&mdash;Thirteen persons
suffered from serious illness. Portions of the pies were poisonous to
mice.</p>

<p>The symptoms in all these cases were not precisely alike; but they
were so far identical as to show as great a similarity as in cases when a
number of persons are poisoned by the same chemical substance. Arsenic,
for instance, produces several types of poisoning; so does phosphorus.</p>

<p>Severe gastro-enteric disturbance, with more or less affection of the
nervous system, were the main characteristics. These symptoms commenced,
as before stated, at various intervals after ingestion of the food;
but they came on with extreme suddenness. Rigors, prostration, giddiness,
offensive diarrh&#339;a, followed by muscular twitchings, dilatation of
the pupil, drowsiness, deepening in bad cases to coma, were commonly
observed. The <i>post-mortem</i> appearances were those of enteritis, with
inflammatory changes in the kidney and liver. Convalescence was slow;
sometimes there was desquamation of the skin.</p>

<p>In many of these cases Dr. Klein found bacteria which, under certain
conditions, were capable of becoming pathogenic; but in no case does
there seem to have been at the same time an exhaustive chemical
inquiry; so that, although there was evidence of a poison passing
through the kidney, the nature of the poison still remains obscure.</p>

<p>The deaths in England and Wales from unwholesome food during ten
years were as follows:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p><a name="Sect_687" id="Sect_687"></a>&sect; 687. <b>German Sausage Poisoning.</b>&mdash;A series of cases may be picked
out from the accounts of sausage poisoning in Germany, all of which
evidently depend upon a poison producing the same symptoms, and the
essentially distinctive mark of which is extreme dryness of the skin and
mucous membranes, dilatation of the pupil, and paralysis of the upper
eyelids (ptosis). In an uncertain time after eating sausages or some
form of meat, from one to twenty-four hours, there is a general feeling
of uneasiness, a sense of weight about the stomach, nausea, and soon
afterwards vomiting, and very often diarrh&#339;a. The diarrh&#339;a is not
severe, never assumes a choleraic form, and is unaccompanied by cramps
in the muscles. After a considerable interval there is marked dryness
of the mucous membrane (a symptom which never fails), the tongue,
pharynx, and the mouth generally seem actually destitute of secretion;
there is also an absence of perspiration, the nasal mucous membrane participates
in this unnatural want of secretion, the very tears are dried up.
In a case related by Kraatzer,<a name="FNanchor_678" id="FNanchor_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> the patient, losing a son, was much
troubled, but wept no tear. This dryness leads to changes in the mucous
membrane, it shrivels, and partly desquamates, aphthous swellings may
occur, and a diffuse redness and diphtheritic-like patches have been noticed.
There is obstinate constipation, probably from a dryness of the mucous
lining of the intestines. The breath has an unpleasant odour, there is
often a croupy cough, the urinary secretion alone is not decreased but
rather augmented. Swallowing may be so difficult as to rise to the grade
of aphagia, and the tongue cannot be manipulated properly, so that the
speech may be almost unintelligible. At the same time, marked symptoms
of the motor nerves of the face are present, the patient&#8217;s sight is disturbed,
he sees colours or sparks before his eyes; in a few cases there has been
transitory blindness, in others diplopia. The pupil in nearly all the cases
has been dilated, also in exceptional instances it has been contracted.
The <i>levator palpebrae superioris</i> is paralysed, and the resulting ptosis
completes the picture. Consciousness remains intact almost to death,
there is excessive weakness of the muscles, perhaps from a general paresis.
If the patient lives long enough, he gets wretchedly thin, and dies from
marasmus. In more rapidly fatal cases, death follows from respiratory
paralysis, with or without convulsions.</p>

<h2>PART VIII.&mdash;THE OXALIC ACID GROUP OF POISONS.</h2>

<p><a name="Sect_688" id="Sect_688"></a>&sect; 688. Oxalic acid is widely distributed both in the free state and in
combination with bases throughout the vegetable kingdom, and it also
occurs in the animal kingdom. In combination with potash it is found
in the <i>Geranium acetosum</i> (L.), <i>Spinacia oleracea</i> (L.), <i>Phytolacca decandra</i>
(L.), <i>Rheum palmatum</i> (L.), <i>Rumex acetosa</i>, <i>Atropa belladonna</i>, and
several others; in combination with soda in different species of <i>Salsola</i>
and <i>Salicornia</i>; and in combination with lime in most plants, especially
in the roots and bark. Many lichens contain half their weight of calcic
oxalate, and oxalic acid, either free or combined, is (according to the
observations of Hamlet and Plowright<a name="FNanchor_679" id="FNanchor_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a>) present in all mature non-microscopic
fungi. Crystals of oxalate of lime may be frequently seen by the
aid of the microscope in the cells of plants. According to Schmidt,<a name="FNanchor_680" id="FNanchor_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> this
crystallisation only takes place in the fully mature cell, for in actively
growing cells the oxalate of lime is entirely dissolved by the albumen of
the plant.</p>

<p>In the animal kingdom oxalic acid is always present in the intestinal
contents of the caterpillar. In combination with lime, it is constantly
found in the allantois liquor of the cow, the urine of man, swine, horses,
and cats. With regard to human urine, the presence or absence of
oxalate of lime greatly depends upon the diet, and also upon the individual,
some persons almost invariably secreting oxalates, whatever their
food may be.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_689" id="Sect_689"></a>&sect; 689. <b>Oxalic Acid</b>, <span class="chemform">H<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>2H<sub>2</sub>O</span> (90 + 36), specific gravity 1&middot;64, occurs
in commerce in prismatic crystals, very similar to, and liable to be mistaken
for, either magnesic or zincic sulphates. The crystals are intensely
acid, easily soluble in water (1 part requiring at 14&middot;5&deg; 10&middot;46 parts of
water); they are also soluble in parts of cold, and readily in boiling,
alcohol. Oxalic acid is slightly soluble in cold absolute ether; but
ether, although extracting most organic acids from an aqueous solution,
will not extract oxalic acid.</p>

<p>Oxalic acid sublimes slowly at 100&deg;, but rapidly and completely at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
150&deg;; the best means of obtaining the pure anhydride is to put a
sufficient quantity of the acid into a strong flask, clamp it by suitable
connections to a mercury pump, and sublime in a vacuum; in this way
a sufficient quantity may be sublimed a little above 100&deg;. It is well to
remember, not only its low subliming temperature, but also that an
aqueous solution, if kept at 100&deg;, loses acid; hence all evaporating or
heating operations must not exceed 98&deg;, or there will be some loss. The
effect of heat is first to drive off water, then, if continued up to about
190&deg;, there is decomposition into carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide,
water, and formic acid; the two reactions occurring simultaneously<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Heated with sulphuric acid to 110&deg;, the following decomposition takes
place:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Oxalic acid decomposes fluor spar, the phosphates of iron, silver, zinc,
copper, and the arseniates of iron, silver, and copper. It may be used
to separate the sulphides of iron and manganese from the sulphides
of zinc, cadmium, uranium, cobalt, mercury, and copper&mdash;dissolving
the former, not the latter. Many minerals and other substances are
also attacked by this acid.</p>

terchloride of gold (avoiding direct exposure to light) the gold is
precipitated<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="chemreact">2AuCl<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> = 6CO<sub>2</sub> + 6HCl + Au<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>When black oxide of manganese (free from carbonate) is mixed with
an oxalate, and treated with dilute sulphuric acid, the oxalic acid is
decomposed, and carbon dioxide evolved<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="chemreact">MnO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> = MnSO<sub>4</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O + 2CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>A similar reaction occurs with permanganate of potash.</p>

<p>If to a solution of oxalic acid, which may be neutralised with an
alkali, or may contain free acetic acid, a solution of acetate of lime be
added, oxalate of lime is thrown down. This salt, important in an
analytical point of view, it will be well to describe.</p>

in the vegetable kingdom, the latter containing <span class="chemform">3H<sub>2</sub>O</span>. Oxalate of lime
cannot be precipitated for quantitative purposes from solutions containing
chromium, aluminium, or ferric iron, since somewhat soluble salts are
formed. It dissolves in solutions of magnesium and manganese,<a name="FNanchor_681" id="FNanchor_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>

copper, silver, lead, cadmium, zinc, nickel, cobalt, strontium, or barium.
It is insoluble in solutions of chlorides of the alkalies and alkaline
earths, and in water, in alkaline solutions, or in acetic acid; and is
soluble in mineral acid only when the acid is strong and in considerable
excess. It is unalterable in the air, and at 100&deg;. When carefully and
slowly ignited it may be wholly converted into carbonate of lime; if the
heat is not properly managed (that is, if excessive), caustic lime may be
formed in greater or smaller quantity.</p>

calico-printers, but also by curriers and harness-makers for cleaning
leather, by marble masons for removing iron stains, by workers in straw
for bleaching, and it is applied to various household purposes,<a name="FNanchor_682" id="FNanchor_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> such as
the whitening of boards, the removing of iron-mould from linen, &amp;c.
The hydropotassic oxalate (binoxalate of potash), under the popular

scouring metals and for removing ink-stains from linen.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_694" id="Sect_694"></a>&sect; 694. <b>Fatal Dose.</b>&mdash;The smallest dose of oxalic acid known to have
destroyed life is, according to Dr. Taylor, 3&middot;88 grms. (60 grains); but
recovery has taken place, on prompt administration of remedies, after
eight times this quantity has been swallowed.</p>

<p>With regard to oxalate of soda, or binoxalate of potash, 14&middot;2 grms.
(half an ounce) have been taken without fatal result, although the
symptoms were very serious; and it may be held that about that quantity
would usually cause death. Oxalic acid is not used in medicine, save as
a salt, <i>e.g.</i>, oxalate of cerium.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_695" id="Sect_695"></a>&sect; 695. <b>Effects of Oxalic Acid and Oxalates on Animals.</b>&mdash;The first
cases of poisoning by oxalic acid occurred early in the nineteenth century,
a little more than fifty years after its discovery. Thompson<a name="FNanchor_683" id="FNanchor_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> was the
first who attempted, by experiment on animal life, to elucidate the action
of the poison; he noted the caustic action on the stomach, and the effects
on the heart and nervous system, which he attributed simply to the local
injury through the sympathetic nerves. Orfila<a name="FNanchor_684" id="FNanchor_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> was the next who took
the matter up, and he made several experiments; but it was Robert
Christison<a name="FNanchor_685" id="FNanchor_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a> who distinctly recognised the important fact that oxalic acid
was toxic, quite apart from any local effects, and that the soluble oxalates,
such as sodic and potassic oxalates, were violent poisons.</p>

the effects of sodic oxalate on rabbits, cats, dogs, guinea-pigs, hedgehogs,
frogs, &amp;c.&mdash;the chief results of which are as follows:&mdash;On injection of
sodic oxalate solution in moderate doses into the circulation, the heart&#8217;s
action, and, therefore, the pulse, become arhythmic; and a dicrotic or tricrotic
condition of the pulse may last even half a day, while at the same
time the frequency may be uninfluenced. The blood-pressure also with
moderate doses is normal, and with small atoxic doses there is no slowing
of the respiration. On the other hand, toxic doses paralyse the respiratory
apparatus, and the animal dies asphyxiated. With chronic and subacute
poisoning the respiration becomes slower and slower, and then
ceases from paralysis of the respiratory muscles. The first sign of poisoning,
whether acute or chronic, is a sleepy condition; dogs lie quiet,
making now and then a noise as if dreaming, mechanical irritations are
responded to with dulness. The hind extremities become weak, and
then the fore. This paresis of the hind extremities, deepening into complete
paralysis, was very constant and striking. Take, for example, from
the paper (<i>op. cit.</i>) the experiment in which a large cat received in six
days five subcutaneous injections of 5 c.c. of a solution of sodic oxalate
(strength 1&nbsp;: 30), equalling &middot;16 grm.; the cat died, as it were, gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
from behind forwards, so that on the sixth day the hinder extremities
were fully motionless and without feeling. The heart beat strongly.
The temperature of the poisoned animal always sinks below the normal
condition. Convulsions in acute poisoning are common, in chronic quite
absent; when present in acute poisoning, they are tetanic or strychnic-like.
In all the experiments of Kobert and K&uuml;ssner, lethal doses of
soluble oxalates caused the appearance of sugar in the urine.</p>

oxalic acid, as sodic oxalate, is poisonous to dogs, if it once gets into the

large amount of lime phosphates in the digestive canal of dogs is decomposed
by oxalic acid, and the harmless lime oxalate formed.</p>

to fill, and on touching one it felt hard, and instantly fell off motionless
and dead; the others were in the same state. They had all bitten, and
the marks were conspicuous, but they had drawn scarcely any blood.
They were applied about six hours after the acid had been taken.&#8221;</p>

on pigeons on the action of oxalic acid when breathed. In one
of his experiments, &middot;75 grm. of the acid was volatilised into a glass shade,
in which a pigeon had been placed; after this had been done five times
in two minutes, there was uneasiness, shaking of the head, and cough,
with increased mucous secretion of the nasal membrane. On continuing
the transmission of the vapour, after eight minutes there was again restlessness,
shaking of the head, and cough; after eleven minutes the bird
fell and was convulsed. On discontinuing the sublimation, it got up and
moved freely, but showed respiratory irritation. On the second day after
the experiment, it was observed that the bird&#8217;s note was hoarse, on the
fourth day there was slowness of the heart&#8217;s action and refusal of food,
and on the sixth day the bird was found dead. Examination after death
showed slight injection of the cerebral membranes; the cellular tissue in
the neighbourhood of the trachea contained in certain places extravasations
of blood, varying from the size of a pea to that of a penny; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>

<p><a name="Sect_698" id="Sect_698"></a>&sect; 698. <b>The Effects of Oxalic Acid and Hydropotassic Oxalate on
Man.</b>&mdash;The cases of oxalic poisoning have been invariably due to either
oxalic acid or hydropotassic oxalate, the neutral sodic or potassic oxalates
having hitherto in no instance been taken. The symptoms, and even
the locally destructive action of oxalic acid and the acid oxalate, are so
similar that neither from clinical nor <i>post-mortem</i> signs could they be
differentiated by anyone not having a previous knowledge of the
case.</p>

<p>The external application of oxalic acid does not appear to cause illness;
workmen engaged in trades requiring the constant use of the acid often
have the nails white, opaque, and brittle; but no direct injury to health
is on record.</p>

<p>A large dose of either causes a local and a remote effect; the local is
very similar to that already described as belonging to the mineral acids,
i.e., more or less destructive of the mucous membranes with which the
acid comes in contact. The remote effects may only be developed after a
little; they consist essentially of a profound influence on the nervous
system. Though more than 120 cases of oxalic acid poisoning have
occurred since Christison wrote his treatise, his graphic description still
holds good. &#8220;If,&#8221; says he, &#8220;a person immediately after swallowing a
solution of a crystalline salt, which tasted purely and strongly acid, is
attacked with burning in the throat, then with burning in the stomach,
vomiting, particularly of bloody matter, imperceptible pulse, and excessive
languor, and dies in half an hour, or still more, in twenty, fifteen, or ten
minutes, I do not know any fallacy which can interfere with the conclusion
that oxalic acid was the cause of death. No parallel disease
begins so abruptly, and terminates so soon; and no other crystalline poison
has the same effect.&#8221; The local action is that of a solvent on the mucous
tissues. If from 10 to 30 grms. are swallowed, dissolved in water, there
is an immediate sour taste, pain, burning in the stomach, and vomiting.
The vomit may be colourless, greenish, or black, and very acid; but there
is a considerable variety in the symptoms. The variations may be partly
explained by saying that, in one class of cases, the remote or true toxic
effects of the poison predominate; in a second, the local and the nervous
are equally divided; while in a third, the local effects seem alone to give
rise to symptoms.</p>

<p>In a case at Guy&#8217;s Hospital, in 1842, there was no pain, but vomiting
and collapse. In another case which occurred in 1870, a male (aged 48)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
took 10&middot;4 grms. (162 grains); he had threatening collapse, cold sweats,
white and red patches on the tongue and pharynx, difficulty in swallowing,
and contracted pupils. Blood was effused from the mouth and anus;
on the following day there were convulsions, coma, and death thirty-six
hours after taking the poison. In another case, there was rapid loss of
consciousness and coma, followed by death in five hours. Death may be
very rapid, <i>e.g.</i>, in one case (<i>Med. Times and Gaz.</i>, 1868) it took place
in ten minutes; there was bleeding from the stomach, which doubtless
accelerated the fatal result. Orfila has recorded a death almost as rapid
from the acid oxalate of potash; a woman took 15 grms.; there was no
vomiting, but she suffered from fearful cramps, and death ensued in fifteen
minutes. In another case, also recorded by Orfila, there was marked
slowing of the pulse, and soporific tendencies. With both oxalic acid
and the acid oxalate of potash, certain nervous and other sequel&aelig; are
more or less constant, always provided time is given for their development.
From the experiments already detailed on animals, one would expect some
paresis of the lower extremities, but this has not been observed in man.
There is more or less inflammation of the stomach, and often peritonitis;
in one case (<i>Brit. Med. Journal</i>, 1873) there were cystitis and acute congestion
of the kidneys with albuminuria.</p>

<p>In two cases quoted by Taylor, there was a temporary loss or enfeeblement
of voice; in one of the two, the aphonia lasted for eight days. In
the other, that of a man who had swallowed about 7 grms. (<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> oz.) of
oxalic acid, his voice, naturally deep, became in nine hours low and
feeble, and continued so for more than a month, during the whole of
which time he suffered in addition from numbness and tingling of the
legs. As a case of extreme rarity may be mentioned that of a young
woman,<a name="FNanchor_691" id="FNanchor_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a> who took 12 grms. (185 grains) of the acid oxalate of potash,
and on the third day died; before death exhibiting delirium so active
and intense that it was described as &#8220;madness.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="Sect_699" id="Sect_699"></a>&sect; 699. <b>Physiological Action.</b>&mdash;Putting on one side the <i>local</i> effects of
oxalic acid, and regarding only its true toxic effects, there is some
difference of opinion as to its action. L. Hermann considers it one of
the heart poisons, having seen the frog&#8217;s heart arrested by subcutaneous
doses of sodic oxalate, an observation which is borne out by the experiments
of Cyon,<a name="FNanchor_692" id="FNanchor_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> and not negatived by those of Kobert and K&uuml;ssner.
The poison is believed to act on the extracardial ganglia. Onsum<a name="FNanchor_693" id="FNanchor_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> held
at one time a peculiar theory of the action of oxalic acid, believing
that it precipitated as oxalate of lime in the lung capillaries, causing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
embolic obstruction; but this view is not now accepted&mdash;there are too
many obvious objections to it. Kobert and K&uuml;ssner do not consider
oxalic acid a heart poison, but believe that its action is directed to the
central nervous system, as attested by sinking of the blood-pressure, the
arhythm and retardation of the pulse, the slow breathing, the paralytic
symptoms, and the fibrillary muscular contraction; but, with regard to
the latter, Locke<a name="FNanchor_694" id="FNanchor_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> has observed that a frog&#8217;s sartorius, immersed in 0&middot;75
sodium oxalate solution, becomes in a few seconds violently active, much
more so than in Biederman&#8217;s normal saline solution. After thirty to forty-five
minutes it loses its irritability, which, however, it partially recovers
by immersion in 0&middot;6 sodium chloride solution. He thinks this may
explain the symptoms of fibrillary muscular contraction observed by
Kobert and K&uuml;ssner, which they ascribe to an action on the central
nervous system.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_700" id="Sect_700"></a>&sect; 700. <b>Pathological Changes.</b>&mdash;Kobert and K&uuml;ssner observed that
when oxalate of soda was subcutaneously injected into animals, there was
often abscess, and even gangrene, at the seat of the injection. If the poison
were injected into the peritoneal cavity, death was so rapid as to leave
little time for any coarse lesions to manifest themselves. They were not
able to observe a cherry-red colour of the blood, nor did they find oxalate
of lime crystals in the lung capillaries; there were often embolic processes
in the lung, but nothing typical. They came, therefore, to the
conclusion that the state of the kidneys and the urine was the only
typical sign. The kidneys were dark, full of blood, but did not show any
microscopic h&aelig;morrhages. Twelve hours after taking the poison there is
observed in the cortical substance a fine striping corresponding to the
canaliculi; in certain cases the whole boundary layer is coloured white.
If the poisoning lasts a longer time, the kidneys become less blood-rich,
and show the described white striping very beautifully; this change
persists several weeks. The cause of this strange appearance is at once
revealed by a microscopical examination; it is due to a deposition of oxalate
of lime; no crystals are met with in the glomerules. Both by the microscope
and by chemical means it may be shown that the content of the
kidney in oxalates is large.<a name="FNanchor_695" id="FNanchor_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> So far as the tissues generally are concerned,
free oxalic acid is not likely to be met with; there is always
present sufficient lime to form lime oxalate. The urine was always
albuminous and contained a reducing substance, which vanished about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
second day after the dose. Hyaline casts and deposits of oxalates in the

<p><a name="Sect_701" id="Sect_701"></a>&sect; 701. Observations of the pathological effects of the oxalates on man
have been confined to cases of death from the corrosive substances mentioned,
and hence the intestinal tract has been profoundly affected.</p>

<p>In the museum of St. Thomas&#8217; Hospital is a good example of the
effects produced. The case was that of a woman who had taken a large,
unknown quantity of oxalic acid, and was brought to the hospital dead.
The mucous membrane of the gullet is much corrugated and divided into
numerous parallel grooves, these again by little transverse grooves, so that
the intersection of the two systems makes a sort of raised pattern. It is
noted that in the recent state the mucous membrane could be removed
in flakes; in the upper part it was whitish, in the lower slate-coloured. The
stomach has a large perforation, but placing the specimen beside another
in the same museum which illustrates the effect of the gastric juice,
in causing an after-death solution of a portion of the stomach, I was
unable to differentiate between the two. The mucous membrane had
the same shreddy flocculent appearance, and is soft and pale. The
pyloric end is said to have been of a blackish colour, and no lymph was
exuded.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_702" id="Sect_702"></a>&sect; 702. The pathological changes by the acid oxalate of potash are
identical with those of oxalic acid, in both the gullet and stomach
being nearly always more or less inflamed or corroded; the inflammation
in a few cases has extended right through into the intestinal canal;
there are venous hyper&aelig;mia, h&aelig;morrhages, and swelling of the mucous
membrane of the stomach. The h&aelig;morrhages are often punctiform, but
occasionally larger, arranged in rows on the summits of the rug&aelig;; sometimes
there is considerable bleeding. In the greater number of cases
there is no actual erosion of the stomach, but the inner layer appears
abnormally transparent. On examining the mucous membrane under the
microscope, Lesser<a name="FNanchor_697" id="FNanchor_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> has described it as covered with a layer which
strongly reflects light, and is to be considered as caused by a fine precipitate
of calcic oxalate. Lesser was unable to find in any case oxalic
acid crystals, or those of the acid oxalate of potash. There are many
cases of perforation on record, but it is questionable whether they are
not all to be regarded as <i>post-mortem</i> effects, and not life-changes; at
all events, there is little clinical evidence to support the view that
these perforations occur during life. In the case (mentioned <i>ante</i>) in
which death took place by coma, the brain was hyper&aelig;mic. The
kidneys, as in the case of animals, show the white zone, and are congested,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
and can be proved by microscopical and chemical means to be rich in
oxalates.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_703" id="Sect_703"></a>&sect; 703. <b>Separation of Oxalic Acid from Organic Substances, the
Tissues of the Body, &amp;c.</b>&mdash;From what has been stated, no investigation
as to the cause of poison, when oxalic acid is suspected, can be considered
complete unless the analyst has an opportunity of examining both the
urine and the kidneys; for although, in most cases&mdash;when the acid itself,
or the acid potassic salt has been taken&mdash;there may be ample evidence,
both chemical and pathological, it is entirely different if a case of poisoning
with the neutral sodic salt should occur. In this event, there may
be no congested appearance of any portion of the intestinal canal, and
the evidence must mainly rest on the urine and kidneys.</p>

<p>Oxalic acid being so widely distributed in the vegetable kingdom, the
expert must expect, in any criminal case, to be cross-examined by ingenious
counsel as to whether or not it was possible that the acid could have
entered the body in a rhubarb-pie, or accidentally through sorrel mixed
with greens, &amp;c. To meet these and similar questions it is important to
identify, if possible, any green matters found in the stomach. In any
case, it must be remembered, that although rhubarb has been eaten for
centuries, and every schoolboy has occasionally chewed small portions of
sorrel, no poisoning has resulted from these practices. When oxalic acid
has been taken into the stomach, it will invariably be found partly in
combination with lime, soda, ammonia, &amp;c., and partly free; or if such
antidotes as chalk has been administered, it may be wholly combined.
Vomiting is nearly always present, and valuable evidence of oxalic acid
may be obtained from stains on sheets, carpets, &amp;c. In a recent case of
probably suicidal poisoning, the writer found no oxalic acid in the contents
of the stomach, but some was detected in the copious vomit which
had stained the bed-clothes. The urine also contained a great excess of
oxalate of lime&mdash;a circumstance of little value taken by itself, but confirmatory
with other evidence. If a liquid is strongly acid, oxalic acid
may be separated by dialysis from organic matters, and the clear fluid
thus obtained precipitated by sulphate of lime, the oxalate of lime being
identified by its microscopic form and other characters.</p>

<p>The usual general method for the separation of oxalic acid from organic
substances or mixtures is the following:&mdash;Extract with boiling water,
filter (which in some cases must be difficult or even impossible), and then
precipitate with acetate of lead. The lead precipitate may contain, besides
oxalate of lead, phosphate, chloride, sulphate, and various organic substances
and acids. This is to be decomposed by sulphuretted hydrogen,
and on filtering off the sulphide of lead, oxalic acid is to be tested for in
the filtrate. This process can only be adopted with advantage in a few
cases, and is by no means to be recommended as generally applicable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
The best general method, and one which insures the separation of oxalic
acid, whether present as a free acid, as an alkaline, or a calcic oxalate, is
perhaps the following:&mdash;The substance or fluid under examination is
digested with hydrochloric acid until a fluid capable of filtration is
obtained; the free acid is neutralised by ammonia in very slight excess,
and permitted to deposit, and the fluid is then carefully decanted, and
the deposit thrown on a filter. The filtrate is added to the decanted fluid,
and precipitated with a slight excess of acetate of lime&mdash;this precipitate,
like the first, being collected on a filter. The first precipitate contains
all the oxalic acid which was in combination with lime; the second,
all that which was in the free condition. Both precipitates should be
washed with acetic acid. The next step is to identify the precipitate
which is supposed to be oxalate of lime. The precipitate is washed into
a beaker, and dissolved with the aid of heat by adding, drop by drop,
pure hydrochloric acid; it is then reprecipitated by ammonia, and allowed
to subside completely, which may take some time. The supernatant fluid
is decanted, and the precipitate washed by subsidence; it is lastly dried
over the water-bath in a tared porcelain dish, and its weight taken. The
substance is then identified by testing the dried powder as follows:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) It is whitish in colour, and on ignition in a platinum dish leaves a
grey carbonate of lime. All other organic salts of lime&mdash;viz., citrate,
tartrate, &amp;c.&mdash;on ignition become coal-black.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) A portion suspended in water, to which is added some sulphuric
acid, destroys the colour of permanganate of potash&mdash;the reaction being
similar to that on <a href="#Page_511">p. 511</a>&mdash;a reaction by which, as is well known, oxalic
acid or an oxalate may be conveniently titrated. This reaction is so
peculiar to oxalic acid, that there is no substance with which it can be
confounded. It is true that uric acid in an acid solution equally decolorises
permanganate, but it does so in a different way; the reaction between
oxalic acid and permanganate being at first slow, and afterwards rapid,
while the reaction with uric acid is just the reverse&mdash;at first quick, and
towards the end of the process extremely slow.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) A portion placed in a test-tube, and warmed with concentrated
sulphuric acid, develops on warming carbon oxide and carbon dioxide;
the presence of the latter is easily shown by adapting a cork and bent
tube to the test-tube, and leading the evolved gases through baryta
water.</p>

<p>Alexander Gunn<a name="FNanchor_698" id="FNanchor_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> has described a new method of both detecting and
estimating oxalic acid; it is based on the fact that a small trace of oxalic
acid, added to an acid solution of ferrous phosphate, strikes a persistent
lemon-yellow colour; the depth of colour being proportionate to the
amount of oxalic acid.</p>

<p>The reagents necessary for both quantitative and qualitative testing are
as follows:&mdash;A standard solution of oxalic acid, of which 100 c.c. equal
1 grm., and a solution of ferrous phosphate, containing about 12&middot;5 per
cent. of <span class="chemform">Fe<sub>3</sub>2PO<sub>4</sub></span>, with excess of phosphoric acid.</p>

<p>Into each of two Nessler graduated glasses 7&middot;5 c.c. of the ferrous
phosphate solution are run and made up to 50 c.c. with distilled water;
both solutions should be colourless; 1, 2, or more c.c. of the solution
to be tested are then run into one of the Nessler glasses; if oxalic acid
be present, a more or less deep tint is produced; this must be imitated
by running the standard solution of oxalic acid into the second Nessler
cylinder&mdash;the calculation is the same as in other colorimetric estimations.
It does not appear to be reliable quantitatively, if alum is present; and
it is self-evident that the solution to be tested must be fairly free from
colour.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_704" id="Sect_704"></a>&sect; 704. <b>Oxalate of Lime in the Urine.</b>&mdash;This well-known urinary
sediment occurs chiefly as octahedra, but hour-glass, contracted or dumbbell-like
bodies, compound octahedra, and small, flattened, bright discs,
not unlike blood discs, are frequently seen. It may be usually identified
under the field of the microscope by its insolubility in acetic acid, whilst
the ammonio mag. phosphate, as well as the carbonate of lime, are both
soluble in that acid. From urates it is distinguished by its insolubility
in warm water. A chemical method of separation is as follows:&mdash;The
deposit is freed by subsidence as much as possible from urine, washed
with hot water, and then dissolved in hydrochloric acid and filtered; to
the filtrate ammonia is added in excess. The precipitate may contain
phosphates of iron, magnesia, lime, and oxalate of lime. On treatment
of the precipitate by acetic acid, the phosphates of the alkaline earths (if
present) dissolve; the insoluble portion will be either phosphate of iron,
or oxalate of lime, or both. On igniting the residue in a platinum dish,
any oxalate will be changed to carbonate, and the carbonate of lime may
be titrated with d. n. <span class="chemform">HCl</span> acid and cochineal solution, and from the

in the acid solution by ferrocyanide of potassium, or it can be
determined by the ordinary methods. If the qualitative detection of
oxalate of lime in the deposit is alone required, it is quite sufficient
evidence should the portion insoluble in acetic acid, on ignition in a

in which apparently nothing but sulphur has separated should be treated
as follows:&mdash;A test-tube is half filled with the liquid, and then a
couple of c.c. of petroleum ether or of benzene added, the tube closed
by the thumb, and the contents well shaken. The sulphur dissolves, and
is held in solution by the solvent, which latter forms a clear upper
layer. If traces of a metallic sulphide were mixed with the sulphur,
thin coloured films are seen at the junction of the two layers, and the
sulphides may also coat the tube above the level of the liquid with a
slight faintly-coloured pellicle (<i>Chem. News</i>, Jan. 4, 1895).</p>

It occurs in commerce in whitish-grey, somewhat brittle, crystalline
masses, and is obtained by subjecting arsenical pyrites to sublimation in
earthen retorts, the arsenic being deposited in suitable receivers on sheet
iron. Metallic arsenic is probably not poisonous, but may be changed
by the animal fluids into soluble compounds, and then exert toxic effects&mdash;volatilised
metallic arsenic is easily transformed in the presence of air
into arsenious acid, and is therefore intensely poisonous.</p>

temperature of 204&middot;4&deg;.</p>

<p>In analysis it is obtained in brilliant octahedral crystals as a sublimate
on discs of glass, or within tubes, the result of heating a film of metallic
arsenic with access of air. It is obtained in commerce on a very large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
scale from the roasting of arsenical pyrites. As thus derived, it is
usually in the form of a white cake, the arsenious acid existing in two
forms&mdash;an amorphous and a crystalline&mdash;the cake being generally
opaque externally, whilst in the centre it is transparent. According to
Kruger, this change from the crystalline to the amorphous condition
is dependent upon the absorption of moisture, no alteration taking place
in dry air. Both varieties of arsenious anhydride are acid to test-paper.</p>

<p>The solubility of arsenious acid is often a question involving chemical
legal matters of great moment. Unfortunately, however, no precisely
definite statement can be made on this point, the reason being that the
two varieties of arsenic occur in very different proportions in different
samples. Both the amorphous and crystalline varieties having very
unequal solubilities, every experimenter in succession has given a different
series of figures, the only agreement amid the general discrepancy being
that arsenic is very sparingly soluble in water.</p>

<p>The statement of Taylor may, however, be accepted as very near the
truth, viz., that an ounce of cold water dissolves from half a grain to a
grain. According to M. L. A. Buchner,<a name="FNanchor_701" id="FNanchor_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> one part of crystalline arsenious
acid dissolves after twenty-four hours&#8217; digestion in 355 parts of water at
15&deg;; and the amorphous, under the same condition, in 108 of water. A
boiling solution of the crystalline acid, left to stand for twenty-four hours,
retains one part of acid in 46 of water; a similar solution of the amorphous
retains one of arsenic in 30 parts of water, <i>i.e.</i>, 100 parts of water

If supplied with air in insufficient quantity, if the flame itself be cooled
by (for example) a cold porcelain plate, or if the gas pass through a tube
any portion of which is heated to redness, the gas is decomposed and the
metal separated. Such a decomposition may be compared to the deposit
of carbon from ordinary flames, when made to play upon a cooled surface.
It may also be decomposed by the electric spark,<a name="FNanchor_703" id="FNanchor_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a> <i>e.g.</i>, if the gas is passed

with two large Bunsen&#8217;s cells, then, under these conditions, arsenic as a
metal is deposited in the neighbourhood of the sparks. For the decomposition
to be complete, the gas should not be delivered at a greater speed
than from 10 to 15 c.c. per minute. The gas burns with a blue-white
flame, which is very characteristic, and was first observed by Wackenroder.
It cannot, however, be properly seen by using the ordinary
apparatus of Marsh, for the flame is always coloured from the glass; but
if the gas is made to stream through a platinum jet, and then ignited, the
characters mentioned are very noteworthy.</p>

<p>Oxygen or air, and arsine, make an explosive mixture. Chlorine
decomposes the gas with great energy, combining with the hydrogen, and
setting free arsenic as a brown cloud; any excess of chlorine combines
with the arsenic as a chloride. Sulphur, submitted to arseniuretted
hydrogen, forms sulphuretted hydrogen, whilst first arsenic and then
sulphide of arsenic separate. Phosphorus acts in a similar way. Arseniuretted
and sulphuretted hydrogen may be evolved at ordinary temperatures
without decomposition; at the boiling-point of mercury (350&deg;)
they are decomposed, sulphide of arsenic and hydrogen being formed;
thus, <span class="chemform">3H<sub>2</sub>S</span> + <span class="chemform">2AsH<sub>3</sub></span> = <span class="chemform">As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub></span> + <span class="chemform">6H<sub>2</sub></span>, a reaction which is of some importance
from a practical point of view. Many metals have also the property
of decomposing the gas at high temperatures, and setting hydrogen
free. Metallic oxides, again, in like manner combine with arsenic,
and set water free, <i>e.g.</i>, <span class="chemform">3CuO</span> + <span class="chemform">2H<sub>3</sub>As</span> = <span class="chemform">Cu<sub>3</sub>As<sub>2</sub></span> + <span class="chemform">3H<sub>2</sub>O</span>.</p>

<p>This reaction admits of valuable practical application to the estimation

of nitrate of silver is easily got rid of by a chloride of sodium solution,
and the absorption and decomposition of the gas are complete.</p>

<p>In cases of poisoning by arsine, the blood, when examined by the
spectroscope (a process the analyst should never omit where it is possible),
is of a peculiar inky colour, and the bands between D and C are melted

remains unaltered.</p>

that by making them breathe a dose of arsine, which would not be
immediately fatal, icterus was always produced under these circumstances,
and could be always detected by the appearance of the tissues. The bile
is remarkably thickened, and the theory is, that in such cases the jaundice
is purely mechanical, the gall-duct being occluded by the inspissated
bile. Rabbits experimented upon similarly showed increased biliary
secretion, but no jaundice; while it was proved that cats are not so
sensitive to arsine as either rabbits or dogs. There are not wanting
instances of arsine having been breathed by man&mdash;the discoverer of the

a flaw in his apparatus he smelt strongly at the joints, and died in eight

nausea, giddiness, and <i>malaise</i>. In the afternoon he felt an uncommon
weight of the limbs, and an oppression in breathing. His fellow-workmen
thought that he looked yellow. On going home he lay down and
passed into a narcotic sleep. Next morning he went to his work as
usual, but was not capable of doing anything; he passed bloody urine
several times throughout the day, and fell into a deep sleep, from which
he could scarcely be roused. On the third day after the accident, a
physician called in found him in a deep sleep, with well-developed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
jaundice, the temperature moderately high, pulse 100. On the fifth day
the jaundice diminished, but it was several months before he could
resume his work.</p>

<p>(2) J. T., aged 19, suffered from similar symptoms after five and
a half hours&#8217; exposure to the gas. He went home, vomited, was
jaundiced, and suffered from bloody urine; in six days became convalescent,
but could not go to work for many months.</p>

<p>(3) C. E. was very little exposed, but was unwell for a few days.</p>

<p>(4) L. M., 37 years old, was exposed two days to the gas; he
vomited, had bloody urine, passed into a narcotic sleep, and died in three
days from the date of the first exposure.</p>

<p>(5) J. S., aged 40, was exposed for two days to the gas; the symptoms
were similar to No. 4, there was suppression of urine, the catheter drawing
blood only, and death in eight days.</p>

<p>(6) M. E., 36 years old; death in three days with similar symptoms.</p>

<p>(7), (8), and (9) suffered like Nos. 1 and 2, and recovered after several
months.</p>

<p>The chief <i>post-mortem</i> appearance was a dirty green colour of the

<span class="chemform">AsCl<sub>3</sub></span> = 181&middot;5; specific gravity liquid, 0&deg; 2&middot;205; boiling-point 134&deg;
(273&middot;2&deg;F.), is a heavy, colourless, oily liquid, which has been used as
an escharotic in cancerous affections (principally by quacks). In one
process of detecting and estimating arsenic, the properties of this substance
are utilised (see <a href="#Page_575">p. 575</a>). It is immediately decomposed by water
into arsenious and hydrochloric acids.</p>

<p><b>The Iodide of Arsenic</b> (<span class="chemform">AsI<sub>3</sub></span>) is used occasionally in skin diseases, but
is of little interest to the analyst; it is commonly seen in the form of
brick-red brilliant flakes.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_715" id="Sect_715"></a>&sect; 715. <b>Arsenic in the Arts.</b>&mdash;The metal is used in various alloys;
for example, speculum metal is made of tin, copper, and a little arsenic;
white copper is an alloy of copper and arsenic; shot is composed of 1000
parts of lead mixed with 3 of arsenic; the common Britannia metal used
for tea-pots, spoons, &amp;c., often contains arsenic; and brass is bronzed
with a thin film of arsenic. It was formerly much employed in the
manufacture of glass, but is being gradually superseded. It is also now
used to some extent in the reduction of indigo blue, and in that of nitro-benzole
in the manufacture of aniline.</p>

<p>In cases of suspected poisoning, therefore, and the finding of arsenic
in the stomach, or elsewhere, it may be set up as a defence that the
arsenic was derived from shot used in the cleansing of bottles, from the
bottles themselves, or from metal vessels, such as tea-pots, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The arsenic in all these alloys being extremely insoluble, any solution
to a poisonous extent is in the highest degree improbable. It may, however,
be necessary to treat the vessels with the fluid or fluids which have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
been supposed to exert this prejudicial action, and test them for arsenic.
The treatment should, of course, be of a severe and exhaustive character,
and the fluids should be allowed to stand cold in the vessels for twenty-four
hours; then the effect of a gentle heat should be studied, and,
lastly, that of boiling temperatures. The analysis of the alloy itself, or
of the glass, it would seldom be of value to undertake, for the crushed
and finely divided substance is in a condition very different from that of
the article when entire, and inferences drawn from such analytical data
would be fallacious.</p>

<p>Arsenious anhydride is also used for the preservation of wood, and is
thrown occasionally into the holds of vessels in large quantities to prevent
vegetable decomposition. In India, again, a solution of arsenic is
applied to the walls as a wash, in order to prevent the attacks of
insects.</p>

<p>Arsenious acid is used by dentists to destroy the nervous pulp of
decayed and painful teeth, about the twenty-fifth of a grain (2&middot;5 mgrms.)
being placed in the cavity. A common formula is arsenious acid, 2;
sulphate of morphine, 1; creasote, q. s. to make a stiff paste. There is
no record of any accident having resulted from this practice hitherto;
but since the dentist seldom weighs the arsenic, it is not altogether free
from danger.</p>

<p>(5) <b>Pigments, &amp;c.</b>&mdash;<i>King&#8217;s yellow</i> should be <span class="chemform">As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub></span>, the trisulphide of
arsenic or orpiment. It is frequently adulterated with 80 to 90 per cent.
of arsenious acid, and in such a case is, of course, more poisonous.
King&#8217;s yellow, if pure, yields to water nothing which gives any arsenical
reaction.</p>

<p>A blue pigment, termed <i>mineral blue</i>, consists of about equal parts of
arsenite of copper and potash, and should contain 38&middot;7 per cent. of
metallic arsenic (= to 51&middot;084 <span class="chemform">As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>H</span>) and 15&middot;6 of copper.</p>

<p><b>Schweinfurt green</b> (Syn. <i>Emerald-green</i>), <span class="chemform">(CuAs<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Cu(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub></span> is
a cupric arsenite and acetate, and should contain 25 per cent. of copper
and 58&middot;4 per cent. of arsenious acid. In analysis, the copper in this
compound is readily separated from the arsenic by first oxidising with
nitric acid, and then adding to the nitric acid solution ammonia, until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
the blue colour remains undissolved. At this point ammonium oxalate
is added in excess, the solution is first acidified by hydrochloric or nitric
acid, and, on standing, the copper separates completely (or almost so) as
Oxalate, the arsenic remaining in solution.</p>

<p>Another method is to pass <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span> to saturation, collect the sulphides on
a filter, and, after washing and drying the mixed sulphides, oxidise with
fuming nitric acid, evaporate to dryness, and again treat with nitric acid.
The residue is fused with soda and potassic nitrate, the fused mass is
dissolved in water, acidulated with nitric acid, and the copper is precipitated
by potash; the solution is filtered, and in the filtrate the
arsenic is precipitated as ammonio-magnesian arseniate or as trisulphide.<a name="FNanchor_713" id="FNanchor_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a></p>

<p><a name="Sect_718" id="Sect_718"></a>&sect; 718. <b>Law Relative to the Sale of Arsenic.</b>&mdash;By the 14th of Vict.
c. 12, every person selling arsenic is bound to keep a written record of
every particular relative to each transaction, such as the name, abode,
and calling of the purchaser, the purpose for which the poison is required,
and the quantity sold, &amp;c. These particulars are to be signed also by
the purchaser. No person (sec. 2) is allowed to sell arsenic to any one
unknown to the seller, unless in the presence of a witness whom the
seller is acquainted with. The arsenic sold (sec. 3) is to be mixed with
soot or indigo in the proportion of half an ounce of indigo to a pound of
arsenic. It, therefore, follows that the coloured substance should not
contain more than 70 per cent. of arsenious acid. The Act applies to
all the colourless preparations of arsenic: but it is not to affect chemists
in making up prescriptions for medical men, or in supplying medical men;
nor is it to affect the wholesale dealers in supplying arsenic to retail
shops, &amp;c. The penalty for conviction is &pound;20, or less.<a name="FNanchor_715" id="FNanchor_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_715" id="Footnote_715"></a><a href="#FNanchor_715"><span class="label">[715]</span></a> Commercial arsenic is often much adulterated, especially with
gypsum, chalk, &amp;c. These are most readily detected by subliming the
arsenic. The sublimed arsenic itself may not be entirely pure, sometimes
containing arsenical sulphides and antimonious oxide.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p><a name="Sect_719" id="Sect_719"></a>&sect; 719. <b>Dose.</b>&mdash;The smallest dose of arsenic known to have proved
fatal to a human being is &middot;16 grm. (2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> grains). Farriers and grooms are
in the habit of giving as much as l&middot;3 grm. (20 grains) a day to a horse,
so that the poisonous dose for this animal must be very large.</p>

<p>The maximum dose for the horned cattle appears to be from &middot;32 to
&middot;38 grm. (5 to 6 grains); that for a dog is 16 mgrms. (<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> grain), and even
this may, in the smaller kinds, cause illness.</p>

<p>The following may be considered as <i>dangerous doses</i> of arsenic:&mdash;&middot;13
grm. (2 grains) for an adult; 1&middot;9 grm. (30 grains) for a horse; &middot;64 grm.
(10 grains) for a cow; and 32 to 64 mgrms. (<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to 1 grain) for a dog.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_720" id="Sect_720"></a>&sect; 720. <b>Effects of Arsenious Acid on Plants.</b>&mdash;If the root or stem of
a plant is immersed in a solution of arsenious acid, the hue of the leaves
soon alters in appearance, the green colour becomes of a whitish or
brownish hue, and the plant withers; the effect being very similar to
that produced by hot water. The toxic action may be traced from below
upwards, and analysis will detect minute quantities of arsenic in all
portions of the plant.</p>

<p>It has, however, been shown by Gorup-Besanez,<a name="FNanchor_716" id="FNanchor_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> that if arsenious acid
be mixed with earth, and plants grown in such earth, they only take up
infinitesimal quantities of arsenic. Hence, in cases of cattle poisoning,
any defence based upon the alleged presence of arsenic in the pasture will
be more ingenious than just.</p>

<p>The influence of arsenical fumes as evolved from manufactories upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
shrubs and trees is in general insignificant. Pines and firs, five to six
years old, have been known to suffer from a disease in which there is a
shedding of the leaves, the more tender herbage being at the same time
affected. Whatever dangers the practice of steeping corn intended for
seed in a solution of arsenious acid, as a preventive of &#8220;smut,&#8221; may
possess, it does not appear to influence deleteriously the growth of the
future plant.</p>

<p>Superphosphate of manure is frequently rich in arsenic. Dr. Edmund
Davy asserts that plants to which such manure is applied take up arsenic
in their tissues, and M. Andonard has made a similar statement. Tuson<a name="FNanchor_717" id="FNanchor_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a>
has also undertaken some experiments, which confirm Andonard and
Davy&#8217;s researches. The bearing of this with relation to the detection of
arsenic in the stomachs of the herbivora needs no comment.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_721" id="Sect_721"></a>&sect; 721. <b>Effects on Animal Life&mdash;Animalcules.</b>&mdash;All infusoria and
forms of animalcule-life hitherto observed perish rapidly if a minute
quantity of arsenious acid is dissolved in the water in which they exist.</p>

<p><b>Insects.</b>&mdash;The common arsenical fly-papers afford numerous opportunities
for observing the action of arsenic on ordinary flies; within a few
minutes (five to ten after taking the poison into their digestive organs)
they fall, apparently from paralysis of the wings, and die. Spiders and
all insects into which the poison has been introduced exhibit a similar
sudden death. It is said that in the neighbourhood of arsenical manufactories
there is much destruction among bees and other forms of insect
life.</p>

<p><b>Annelids.</b>&mdash;If arsenious acid is applied to the external surface of
worms or leeches, the part which it touches perishes first, and life is
extinguished successively in the others. If a wound is made first, and
the arsenious acid then applied to it, the effects are only intensified and
hastened. There is always noticed an augmentation of the excretions;
the vermicular movements are at first made more lively, they then become
languid, and death is very gradual.</p>

<p><b>Birds.</b>&mdash;The symptoms with birds are somewhat different, and vary
according to the form in which the poison is administered, viz., whether
as a vapour or in solution. In several experiments made by Eulenberg
on pigeons, the birds were secured under glass shades, and exposed to
the vapour of metallic arsenic vaporised by heat. It is scarcely necessary
to remark that in operating in this way, the poisoning was not
by metallic arsenic vapour, but by that of arsenious acid. One of these
experiments may be cited:&mdash;A pigeon was made to breathe an atmosphere
charged with vapour from the volatilisation of metallic arsenic.
The bird was immediately restless; in thirty minutes it vomited
repeatedly, and the nasal apertures were noticed to be moist; after a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
little while, the bird, still breathing the arsenious acid atmosphere, was
much distressed, shook its head repeatedly, and yawned; in fifty minutes
the respiration was laboured, and in fifty-nine minutes there was much
vomiting. On removing the bird, after it had been exposed an hour to
the vapour (&middot;16 grm. of metallic arsenic having been evaporated in all),
it rapidly recovered.</p>

<p>Six days after, the pigeon was again exposed in the same way to the
vapour, but this time &middot;56 grm. of metallic arsenic was volatilised. In
fifteen minutes there was retching, followed by vomiting. On taking it
out after an hour it remained very quiet, ate nothing, and often puffed
itself out; the breathing was normal, movements free, but it had unusual
thirst. On the second and third day the excretions were frequent and
fluid; the cardiac pulsations were slowed, and the bird was disinclined
to move. On the fourth day it continued in one place, puffing itself
out; towards evening the respirations slowed, the beak gaping at every
inspiration. On attempting flight, the wings fluttered and the bird fell
on its head. After this it lay on its side, with slow, laboured respiration,
the heart-beats scarcely to be felt, and death took place without
convulsions, and very quietly. On examining the organs after death,
the brain and spinal cord were very bloodless; there were ecchymoses in
the lungs; but little else characteristic. The experiment quoted has a
direct bearing upon the breathing of arsenical dust; as, for example,
that which floats in the air of a room papered with an easily detached
arsenical pigment. Other experiments on birds generally have shown
that the symptoms produced by arsenious acid in solution, or in the solid
form, in a dose insufficient to destroy life, are languor, loss of appetite, and
the voidance of large quantities of liquid excreta like verdigris. With
fatal doses, the bird remains quiet; there are fluid, sometimes bloody,
excretions; spasmodic movements of the pharynx, anti-peristaltic contraction
of the &#339;sophagus, vomiting, general trembling of the body,
thirst, erection of the feathers, and laboured respiration. The bird
becomes very feeble, and the scene mostly closes with insensibility and
convulsions.</p>

<p><b>Mammals</b>, such as cats, dogs, &amp;c., suffer from symptoms fairly identical
with those observed in man; but the nervous symptoms (according
to P. Hugo) do not predominate, while with rabbits and guinea-pigs,
nervous symptoms are more marked and constant.<a name="FNanchor_718" id="FNanchor_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> There are vomiting,
purging, and often convulsions and paralysis before death. It has been
noticed that the muscles after death are in a great state of contraction.
The slow poisoning of a dog, according to Lolliot,<a name="FNanchor_719" id="FNanchor_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> produced an erythematous
eruption in the vicinity of the joints, ears, and other parts of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
body; there were conjunctivitis, increased lachrymal secretion, and
photophobia; the hair fell off.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_722" id="Sect_722"></a>&sect; 722. <b>Effects of Arsenious Acid on Man.</b>&mdash;The symptoms produced
by arsenious acid vary according to the form of the poison&mdash;whether
solid, vaporous, or soluble&mdash;according to the condition of bodily health
of the person taking it, and according to the manner in which it is introduced
into the animal economy, while they are also in no small degree
modified by individual peculiarities of organisation and by habit, as, for
instance, in the arsenic-eaters.</p>

<p><b>Arsenic-Eaters.</b>&mdash;In all European countries grooms and horse-dealers
are acquainted with the fact that a little arsenic given daily in the corn
improves the coat, increases, probably, the assimilation of the food, and
renders the horse plump and fat. On the Continent grooms have been
known to put a piece of arsenic, the size of a pea, in a little oatmeal,
make it into a ball, tie it up in a linen rag, and attach it to the bit; the
saliva dissolves, little by little, the poison, while both the gentle irritation
and physiological action excite a certain amount of salivation, and the
white foam at the mouth, and the champing of the horse, are thought
vastly to improve the appearance. Shot, which contains a small quantity
of arsenic, have been used for the same purpose, and from half a pound
to a pound of small shot has been given to horses. When a horse has
been for a long time dosed with arsenic, it seems necessary to continue
the practice; if this is not done, the animal rapidly loses his condition.
The explanation probably is, that the arsenic stimulates the various cells
and glands of the intestinal tract to a superaction, the natural termination
of which is an enfeeblement of their secreting power&mdash;this especially
in the absence of the stimulus. Turning from equine involuntary arsenic-eaters,
we find the strange custom of arsenic-eating voluntarily pursued by
the races of lower Austria and Styria, especially by those dwelling on the
mountains separating Styria from Hungary. In India also (and especially
in the Punjaub) the same practice prevails, and here it is often taken as
an aphrodisiac. The mountaineers imagine that it increases the respiratory
power, nor is there wanting some evidence to show that this is
actually the fact, and medicinal doses of arsenic have been in use for
some time in cases of asthma and other diseases of the chest. The
arsenic-eaters begin with a very small dose, which is continued for several
weeks or months, until the system gets accustomed to it. The amount
is then slightly augmented until relatively large doses are taken with
impunity. In one case<a name="FNanchor_720" id="FNanchor_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> it appears that a countryman, in good health,
and sixty years of age, took daily 4 grains of arsenious acid, a habit
which he had inherited from his father, and which he in turn bequeathed
to his son.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<div class="footnote">

<hr class="footnote" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span></p>

<p>The existence of such a custom as arsenic-eating, in its literal sense,
has more than once been doubted, but all who have travelled over Styria
and other places where the habit prevails have convinced themselves
that the facts have not been overstated. For example, Dr. Maclagan, in
company with Dr. J. T. Rutter,<a name="FNanchor_721" id="FNanchor_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> visited Styria in 1865, and having
carefully weighed 5 or 6 grains of arsenic, saw these doses actually
swallowed by two men. On collecting their urine, about two hours
afterwards, abundant quantitative evidence of its presence was found;
but in neither of the men were there the slightest symptoms of poisoning.
It is obvious that the existence of such a habit might seriously
complicate any inquiry into arsenical poisoning in these regions.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_723" id="Sect_723"></a>&sect; 723. <b>Manner of Introduction of Arsenic.</b>&mdash;Arsenious acid exerts a
poisonous action, whether it is taken by the stomach, or introduced into
the system by any other channel whatever. The differences in the
symptoms produced by external application (as through a wound), and by
swallowing arsenious acid in substance or in solution, are not so marked
as might be expected. It was probably Hunter who first distinctly
recognised the fact that arsenic, even when introduced outwardly by
application to an abraded surface, exerts a specific effect on the mucous
membrane of the stomach. Brodie<a name="FNanchor_722" id="FNanchor_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> states, &#8220;Mr. Home informed me
that in an experiment made by Mr. Hunter himself, in which arsenic
was applied to a wound in a dog, the animal died in twenty-four hours,
and the stomach was found to be considerably inflamed. I repeated this
experiment several times, taking the precaution of always applying a
bandage to prevent the animal licking the wound. The result was that
the inflammation of the stomach was commonly more violent and more
immediate than when the poison was administered internally, and that it
preceded in appearance the inflammation of the wound.&#8221;</p>

separated in the one case, and &middot;194 grm. (3 grains) in the other. In
these cases arose the question which is sure to recur in legal inquiries into
poisoning by absorption, viz., whether the poison lying on the surface
and folds of the skin could not have been mixed during the <i>post-mortem</i>
examination with the organs of the body? In these particular cases
special care appears to have been taken, and the answer was satisfactory.
It is not amiss, however, to call attention to the extreme precaution
which such instances necessitate.</p>

<p>A woman, aged 51, had used a solution of arsenious acid to cure
the itch; erysipelas of the body, however, followed, and she died after a
long illness&mdash;one of the symptoms noted being trembling and paresis of
the limbs.<a name="FNanchor_725" id="FNanchor_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> In a case recorded by Desgranges,<a name="FNanchor_726" id="FNanchor_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> a young chambermaid
had applied to the unwounded scalp an arsenical ointment for the purpose
of destroying vermin. She also suffered from a severe erysipelas, and
the hair fell off. Quacks have frequently applied various arsenical pastes
to ulcers and cancerous breasts with a fatal result. Instances of this
abound; in one, a charlatan applied to a chronic ulcer of the leg an
arsenical caustic; the patient showed symptoms of violent poisoning, and
died on the sixth day.<a name="FNanchor_727" id="FNanchor_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> In another, a lady suffering from some form of
tumour of the breast, applied to an unqualified practitioner, who made
from fifteen to twenty punctures with a lancet in the swelling, covered a
piece of bread with an arsenical compound, and applied the bread thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
prepared to the breast. Twelve hours afterwards symptoms of violent
gastric irritation commenced; and vomiting and a sanguinolent diarrh&#339;a
followed, with death on the fifth day. Arsenic was found in all the
organs.<a name="FNanchor_728" id="FNanchor_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> Such examples might be multiplied. Arsenic has been in
more than one case introduced criminally into the vagina with a fatal
result.<a name="FNanchor_729" id="FNanchor_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> Foder&eacute;, <i>e.g.</i>, has recorded the case of a maid-servant who
poisoned her mistress by intentionally administering several arsenical
enemata.<a name="FNanchor_730" id="FNanchor_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a> Arsenious acid again has been respired in the form of vapour.
One of the best instances of this is recorded by Taylor, and was the subject
of a trial at the York Lent Assizes, 1864. The prisoner placed some
burning pyrites at the doorway of a small room, in which there were
eight children, including an infant in the cradle. The other children
were removed speedily, but the infant was exposed to the vapour for an
hour; it suffered from vomiting and diarrh&#339;a, and died in twenty-four
hours. There was slight inflammation of the stomach and intestines, the
brain and lungs were congested, and the lining membrane of the trachea
of a bright red colour. Arsenic was detected in the stomach, in the lungs,
and spleen. The pyrites contained arsenic, and the fatal fumes were in
effect composed of sulphurous and arsenious acids.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_725" id="Sect_725"></a>&sect; 725. <b>Arsenic in Wall-Papers.</b>&mdash;It is now an accepted fact that
arsenical colours on wall-papers cause illness. The symptoms are those
of chronic poisoning, and present nothing distinctive from the effects
produced from small doses of arsenic.</p>

<p>Kirschgasser<a name="FNanchor_731" id="FNanchor_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> has described the symptoms in detail of twenty-six cases.
That arsenic is actually present in patients suffering is often susceptible
of proof, by examining skilfully and carefully a considerable volume
(from one to two days&#8217; collection) of the urine; in most of the cases thus
examined arsenic has been discovered. This poisoning is produced, sometimes
from the dust, at others from a volatile compound of arsenic, which
has the following properties:&mdash;It is very volatile (perhaps a gas), it has
a strong alliaceous odour, it is not entirely decomposed by a solution of
silver nitrate, but is apparently decomposed by a boiling acid solution of
potassic permanganate. The author suggests that it may be a compound of
<span class="chemform">CO</span> and As, but this is only a supposition. The existence of this volatile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>
substance has been settled beyond all question by the experiments of
Gosio,<a name="FNanchor_732" id="FNanchor_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> confirmed by those of Charles Robert Sanger.<a name="FNanchor_733" id="FNanchor_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a></p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>This substance appears to be readily enough produced by the action
of the common moulds upon organic matter in the presence of small
amounts of arsenic; the moulds vary in this property: <i>Mucor</i>, <i>Mucedo</i>, and
<i>Aspergillum glaucum</i> react well; on the contrary, <i>Penicillium glaucum</i>,
<i>Mucor ramosus</i>, and several others have either no action, or the action
is but slight. One mould, the <i>Penicillium brevicaule</i>, has quite a special
endowment in forming this peculiar arsenical compound; so much so,
that Gosio has proposed its use as a reagent for arsenic, the garlic odour
being perceived when the fungus is made to grow in solutions containing
organic matter and only traces of arsenic.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_726" id="Sect_726"></a>&sect; 726. <b>Forms of Arsenical Poisoning.</b>&mdash;There are at least four distinct
forms of arsenical poisoning, viz., an acute, subacute, a nervous, and
a chronic form.</p>

<p><b>Acute Form.</b>&mdash;All those cases in which the inflammatory symptoms
are severe from the commencement, and in which the sufferer dies within
twenty-four hours, may be called acute. The commencement of the
symptoms in these cases is always within the hour; they have been
known, indeed, to occur within eight minutes, but the most usual time is
from twenty minutes to half an hour. There is an acrid feeling in the
throat, with nausea; vomiting soon sets in, the ejected matters being at
first composed of the substances eaten; later they may be bilious or even
bloody, or composed of a whitish liquid. Diarrh&#339;a follows and accompanies
the vomiting, the motions are sometimes like those met with in
ordinary diarrh&#339;a and English cholera, and sometimes bloody. There is
coldness of the extremities, with great feebleness, and the pulse is small
and difficult to feel. The face, at first very pale, takes a bluish tint, the
temperature falls still lower; the patient sinks in collapse, and death
takes place in from five to twenty hours after the taking of the poison.</p>

<p>There can scarcely be said to be any clinical feature which distinguishes
the above description from that of cholera; and supposing that cholera
were epidemic, and no suspicious circumstance apparently present, there
can be little doubt that a most experienced physician might mistake the
cause of the malady, unless surrounding circumstances give some hint or
clue to it. In the acute form diarrh&#339;a may be absent, and the patient
die, as it were, from &#8220;shock.&#8221; This was probably the cause of death in
a case related by Casper,<a name="FNanchor_734" id="FNanchor_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> that of Julius Bolle, poisoned by his wife. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
took an unknown quantity of arsenic in solution at seven in the morning,
and in about three-quarters of an hour afterwards suffered from pain and
vomiting, and died in little more than three hours. There were no signs
of inflammation in the stomach and intestines, but from the contents of
the stomach were separated &middot;0132 grm. of arsenious acid, and &middot;00513 grm.
from pieces of the liver, spleen, kidneys, lung, and blood. The dose
actually taken is supposed not to have been less than &middot;388 grm.
(6 grains).</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p><a name="Sect_727" id="Sect_727"></a>&sect; 727. <b>The Subacute Form.</b>&mdash;The subacute form is that which is most
common; it exhibits some variety of phenomena, and individual cases
vary much in the matter of time. The commencement of symptoms is,
as in the most acute form, usually within the hour, but exceptions to this
rule occur. In a case quoted by Taylor,<a name="FNanchor_735" id="FNanchor_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> and recorded by M. Tonnelier,
the poison did not cause any marked illness for eight hours; it was found,
on <i>post-mortem</i> examination, that a cyst had been formed in the stomach
which sheathed the arsenic over, and in some degree explained this
delay. In another case, again, ten hours elapsed, and this is considered
to be the maximum period yet observed. As with the acute form, there
is a feeling of nausea, followed by vomiting, which continues although
the stomach is quite empty; at first the ejected matter is a watery fluid,
but later it may be streaked with blood. The tongue is thickly coated;
there is great thirst, but the drinking of any liquid (even of ice-cold
water) increases the vomiting. Nearly always pain is felt in the epigastrium,
spreading all over the abdomen, and extending to the loin (which
is tense and tender on pressure). Deglutition is often painful, and is
accompanied by a sort of spasmodic constriction of the pharyngeal muscles.
Diarrh&#339;a follows the vomiting, and has the same characters as that previously
described; occasionally, however, this feature is absent. In the
case recorded by Martineau,<a name="FNanchor_736" id="FNanchor_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> a man, aged 25, was seized at 10 <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span> suddenly
with vomiting, which persisted all that day and the next, during
which time the bowels were obstinately confined. On the second day a
purgative was administered, whereupon diarrh&#339;a set in, and continued
until his death, which occurred in about two days and sixteen hours from
the commencement of the symptoms. This case is also remarkable from
the absence of pain or tenderness of the abdomen.</p>

<p>In subacute cases the urine has several times been suppressed, and it
is generally scanty and red in colour. Irregularity of the heart&#8217;s action
and feebleness are tolerably constant phenomena. As the end approaches,
there is excessive muscular weakness, the face is pale, the
eyes hollow; the mucous membranes first, and then the skin, take a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
bluish tint; the skin itself is covered with perspiration, and there has
been noticed a peculiar odour, which has been likened to arsine (arseniuretted
hydrogen). The respiration is troubled, convulsive movements of
the limbs have been observed, and cramps in the calves of the legs;
death follows in a variable time&mdash;from twenty-four hours to several days.
In certain cases there is a curious remission after violent symptoms, the
patient rallies and seems to have recovered; but the appearance is deceptive,
for the symptoms recur, and death follows. Recovery may also
take place partially from the primary effects, and then inflammatory
changes in the stomach, &amp;c., set in, with fever and the ordinary symptoms
which are common in all internal inflammation.</p>

<p>A single dose of arsenious acid may cause a prolonged and fatal illness,
one of the best known examples being that of the suicide of the Duc de
Praslin,<a name="FNanchor_737" id="FNanchor_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> who took, with suicidal intent, on Wednesday, August 18, 1847,
a dose of arsenious acid. The exact time of the act could not be ascertained,
but the first effects appeared at 10 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span>; there were the usual
signs of vomiting, followed on the next day by diarrh&#339;a, fainting, and
extreme feebleness of the pulse. On Friday there was a remission of the
symptoms, but great coldness of the limbs, intermittency and feebleness
of the heart&#8217;s action, and depression. On Saturday there was slight
fever, but no pain or tenderness in the abdomen, vomiting, or diarrh&#339;a;
on this day no urine was passed. On the Sunday he complained of
a severe constriction of the throat, and deglutition was extremely
painful; thirst was extreme, the tongue intensely red, as well as the
mucous membrane of the mouth and pharynx, and the patient had a
sensation of burning from the mouth to the anus. The abdomen was
painful and distended, the heat of the skin was pronounced, the pulse
frequent and irregular,&mdash;sometimes strong, at others feeble,&mdash;the bowels
had to be relieved by injections, the urine was in very small quantity;
during the night there was no sleep. The duke died at 4.35 <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span> on
Tuesday the 24th, the sixth day; intelligence was retained to the last.
As the end approached, the respiration became embarrassed, the body
extremely cold, and the pulse very frequent.</p>

either entirely suppressed, or present in but feeble degree; and under
this heading are classed the rare cases in which, in place of the ordinary
symptoms, affections of the nervous system predominate. Narcotism,
paresis, deepening into paralysis, delirium, and even acute mania, as well
as epileptiform convulsions, have all been recorded. In short, the
symptoms show so much variety, that an idea of the malady produced in
this very rare form can only be obtained by studying the clinical history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
of cases which have presented this aspect. In a case recorded by
Guilbert,<a name="FNanchor_738" id="FNanchor_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> a man, thirty-five years of age, had swallowed a solution of
arsenic, half of which was immediately rejected by vomiting. A little
while afterwards his respiration became laborious; the eyes were bathed
with tears, which were so acrid as to inflame the eyelids and the cheeks;
the muscles of the face were from time to time convulsed; he perspired
much, and the perspiration had a f&#339;tid odour; there was some diarrh&#339;a,
the urine was suppressed, and from time to time he was delirious.
Afterwards the convulsions became general, and the symptoms continued
with more or less severity for five days. On the sixth a copious miliary
eruption broke out, and the symptoms became less severe. The eruption
during fifteen days every now and again reappeared, and at the end of
that time the patient was convalescent, but weak, liable to ophthalmia,
and had a universal trembling of the limbs.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_730" id="Sect_730"></a>&sect; 730. <b>Slow Poisoning.</b>&mdash;Slow poisoning has been caused accidentally
by arsenical wall-paper, in the manufacture of arsenical pigments, by the
admixture of small quantities of arsenic with salt or other condiments,
and repeated small doses have been used for criminally producing a fatal
illness intended to simulate disease from natural causes. The illness
produced by small intermittent doses may closely resemble in miniature,
as it were, those produced by large amounts; but, on the other hand,
they may be different and scarcely to be described otherwise than as a
general condition of ill-health and <i>malaise</i>. In such cases there is loss of
appetite, feebleness, and not unfrequently a slight yellowness of the skin.
A fairly constant effect seen, when a solution of arsenious acid is given
continuously for a long time, is an inflammation of the conjunctiv&aelig;, as
well as of the nasal mucous membrane&mdash;the patient complains of
&#8220;always having a cold.&#8221; This inflammatory action also affects the
pharynx, and may extend to the air-passages, and even to the lung-tissue.
At the same time there is often seen an exanthem, which has
received a specific name&mdash;&#8220;<i>eczema arsenicale</i>.&#8221; Salivation is present, the
gums are sore, at times lacerated. In chronic poisoning by arsenic,
nervous symptoms are almost constant, and exhibit great variety; there
may be numbness, or the opposite condition, hyper&aelig;sthesia, in the extremities.
In certain cases fainting, paresis, paralysis, and sometimes
convulsions occur; towards the end a sort of hectic fever supervenes,
and the patient dies of exhaustion.</p>

pretext, and lived for some days at an hotel, ostensibly the wife of another man.
Two days after her return, Mr. and Mrs. Maybrick attended the Grand National
race meeting, and there a serious quarrel arose between them respecting the man
with whom she had cohabited in London; they returned from the race, each
separately, and she slept apart. Next day an apparent reconciliation took place

<p>On or about April 12-19th, 1889, Mrs. Maybrick purchased arsenical fly-papers.
On April 13-20th Mr. Maybrick visited London, and consulted Dr. Fuller for dyspepsia,
who prescribed nux vomica, acids, and mild remedies (but no arsenic); in one bottle
of medicine, ostensibly made according to Dr. Fuller&#8217;s prescription, arsenic was
subsequently found.</p>

<p>Up to Saturday, April 27th, Mr. Maybrick was in his usual health; he was then
sick, numbed, and in pain, and had cramps; he told his clerk he had been an hour
in the water-closet, but whether for diarrh&#339;a or constipation does not appear; he
ascribed the symptoms to an overdose of Fuller&#8217;s medicine. About this date fly-papers
were found by the servants soaking in Mrs. Maybrick&#8217;s bedroom in a sponge-basin,
carefully covered up. On the 29th she again purchased two dozen fly-papers
from another chemist. On April 28th Mr. Maybrick was sick and ill; at 11 <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span>
Dr. R. Humphreys was called in; Mr. Maybrick complained of a peculiar sensation
about his heart, and said he was in dread of paralysis. He attributed his illness to
a strong cup of tea taken before breakfast. On the following day he was better, and
on the 30th still improving. On May 1st and 2nd Mr. Maybrick went to his office
and lunched, both days, off revalenta food, prepared at home and warmed at his office
in a new saucepan purchased for the occasion; on one of these days the lunch was
forgotten, and was sent to Mr. Maybrick by his wife; and on one of the two days,
it is not clear which, Mr. Maybrick complained that his lunch did not agree with
him, and he attributed it to inferior sherry put into his food.</p>

<p>In a jug found at the office, and in which food had been taken there, a trace of
the food still remained after Mr. Maybrick&#8217;s death, and arsenic was found therein.</p>

<p>On May 3rd the last fatal illness set in. It is uncertain what food he had after
breakfast; he went to the office, and returned home between 5 and 6 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span> He had
been seen by Dr. Humphreys in the morning, and appeared then not quite so well;
he found him at midnight suffering from what he thought was severe sciatica; the
patient said he had been sick from revalenta. On May 4th he was continually sick,
nothing could be retained on the stomach, but the sciatic pain was gone; on May 5th
the vomiting continued, the patient complained of the sensation of a hair sticking in
the throat, and of a filthy taste in the mouth. The throat and fauces were only
slightly reddened, the tongue was furred.</p>

<p>On May 6th there was less vomiting, but otherwise the condition was the same,
and Fowler&#8217;s solution ordered, but only a quantity equal to <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>300</sub> grain was actually
taken.</p>

<p>May 7th the condition was improved, but there was no increase of power. Dr. W.
Carter was called in consultation. The vomiting was passing away, and diarrh&#339;a
commencing. The throat was red, dry, and glazed; there were incessant attempts
to cough up an imaginary hair. No cramps, no pain in the stomach or intestines,
nor conjunctivitis. On this day the first direct evidence of diarrh&#339;a is recorded, the
medical men actually seeing a loose motion. The result of the consultation was that
Mr. Maybrick must have taken some irritant in his food or drink.</p>

<p>On the 8th a professional nurse took charge. During the 8th and 9th severe
tenesmus set in with diarrh&#339;a, and blood was observed in the f&aelig;ces. Now arsenic
was suspected, the urine was examined by Dr. Humphreys, and a rough analysis was
made of some Neaves&#8217; food which the patient had been taking.</p>

<p>The patient died on the 10th, at 8.30 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span></p>

<p>The <i>post-mortem</i> appearances were as follows:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The tongue was dark, the top of the gullet slightly red, but otherwise healthy,
save at the lower end, where the mucous membrane was gelatinous, and was dotted
over with black dots, like frogs&#8217; spawn.</p>

<p>There was a small shallow ulcer in the mucous membrane of the larynx at the back
of the epiglottis. The free margin of the epiglottis was rough and eroded; and on
the posterior aspect of the ericoid cartilage there were two small red patches. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548"><span class="fsize110">[548]</span></a></span>
stomach were from 5-6 ozs. of brownish fluid. At the cardiac end there was a large
vermilion-red patch, interspersed here and there with small dark ecchymoses (spoken
of by Dr. Humphreys as a flea-bitten appearance); to this followed a non-inflamed
space, and near the pyloric orifice, and extending 2 inches from it, was another red
inflamed portion of mucous membrane. In the small intestine the mucous membrane
was red and inflamed, from 3 inches below the pylorus to about 3 feet downwards.
About 18 or 20 feet lower down, <i>i.e.</i>, a little below the ileo-c&aelig;cal valve, the mucous
membrane was again inflamed to a lesser extent over a space of about 2 feet; the
lower end of the rectum was also red and inflamed. No arsenic was found in the
stomach or its contents, or in the spleen. Arsenic was present in the liver, in the
intestines, and in the kidneys. The quantity separated altogether amounted to over
0&middot;1 grain. The liver weighed 48 ozs., and from 12 ozs. of the liver 0&middot;076 grain of
arsenic, reckoned as <span class="chemform">As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub></span>, was separated.</p>

<p>The whole course of the symptoms and the <i>post-mortem</i> examination showed that
the deceased died from an irritant poison; and from the fact of a small quantity of
arsenic having been found in the body, there can be little doubt but that the poison
was arsenic. The symptoms were somewhat anomalous, but not more so than in
other recorded cases of undoubted arsenical poisoning. The facts that tended to
connect the accused with the death were as follows:&mdash;On the night of either May
9th or the 10th Mrs. Maybrick was observed to remove from the table an opened
bottle of Valentine&#8217;s meat juice, and take it into an inner dressing-room, and then
replace it&mdash;the acts being surreptitious. In replacing it, she was observed to take it
either from the pocket of her dressing-gown or from an inner pocket. The lining of
this pocket was found to be impregnated with <span class="chemform">As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub></span>. The juice was found to contain
0&middot;5 grain <span class="chemform">As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub></span>, and the liquid was of lower gravity than commercial juice; it had
probably, therefore, been diluted.</p>

<p>The following is a list of things containing arsenic:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<ol class="left">
<li> Mrs. Maybrick&#8217;s dressing-gown.</li>

<li> A handkerchief wrapped around a bottle.</li>
<li> Packet of arsenic &#8220;for cats.&#8221; (Arsenious acid mixed with charcoal.) Tumbler
containing milk, with handkerchief soaking in it; at least 20 grains of
<span class="chemform">As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub></span> in the tumbler mixed with charcoal.</li>
<li> A portion of a handkerchief.</li>
<li> A bottle containing a strong solution of arsenious acid and several grains of
undissolved arsenious acid.</li>
<li> A bottle containing from 15-20 grains of solid arsenic and a few drops of
solution.</li>
<li> A saturated solution of arsenious acid and some solid arsenious acid.</li>
<li> Valentine&#8217;s meat juice.</li>
<li> Price&#8217;s glycerin; <sup>2</sup>&#8260;<sub>3</sub> grain in the whole bottle.</li>
<li> A bottle containing 0&middot;1 grain of arsenious acid.</li>
<li> A bottle from Mr. Maybrick&#8217;s office containing a few drops of medicine prescribed
by Dr. Fuller (decidedly arsenical).</li>
<li> Jug from the office with remains of food.</li>
<li> Sediment from trap of w.c. and lavatory drain containing <span class="chemform">As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub></span>.</li>

<p>Mrs. Maybrick was convicted, but afterwards the sentence was commuted to
penal servitude for life.</p>

some minute researches as to the pathological appearances met with in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
animals. His experiments were made on seven dogs, eight guinea-pigs,
five rabbits, two pigeons, and five cats&mdash;all poisoned by arsenious acid.
According to Hugo, so far as these animals were concerned, changes were
more constant in the intestine than in the stomach.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p><b>Stomach.</b>&mdash;Changes in the mucous membrane were especially noticed
in the great curvature and towards the pylorus; the pylorus itself, and a
part of the cardiac portion, remained unchanged. The mucous membrane
in dogs and cats was red, with a tinge of blue&mdash;in many cases the redness
was in streaks, with injection of the capillaries. The stomach of plant-eaters
was less altered, and a microscopical examination of the mucous
tissues did not show any fatty change.</p>

<p><b>The Intestines.</b>&mdash;In dogs and cats changes were evident; in rabbits
and guinea-pigs they were not so marked, but the intestines of the last
were extremely tender and brittle, very moist, and filled with a slimy,
serous, grey-white fluid; nevertheless, the changes in all these animals
appear to be of essentially the same nature. The most striking effect is
the shedding of a pseudo-membrane; in quite recent cases there is a
layer of from 1 to 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> mm. wide of a transparent, frog-spawn-like jelly
streaking the intestine. In later stages it becomes thicker, while occasionally
it resembles a diphtheritic exudation. The mucous membrane
itself is deep purple-red, showing up by the side of the pseudo-membrane.
With regard to the villi, the epithelial layer is detached, and the capillary
network filled with blood and enlarged.</p>

<p><b>The Liver.</b>&mdash;Hugo met only occasionally with fatty degeneration of
the liver, but there was marked steatosis of the epithelium of the gall-bladder
of dogs. A fact not prominently noticed before, is (at all events,
in dogs) a serous transudation into the pleural sac and acute &#339;dema of
the lungs; the exudation may be excessive, so that more than 100 c.c.
of serous fluid can be obtained from the thorax; there is also usually
much fluid in the pericardium. In two of Hugo&#8217;s experiments there
was fluid in the cerebral ventricles; and in all there was increased
moisture of the brain substance with injection of the capillary vessels,
especially of the pia.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_733" id="Sect_733"></a>&sect; 733. <b>Post-mortem Appearances.</b>&mdash;A remarkable preservation of the
body is commonly, but not constantly, observed. When it does occur
it may have great significance, particularly when the body is placed
under conditions in which it might be expected to decompose rapidly.
In the celebrated Continental case of the apothecary Speichert
(1876), Speichert&#8217;s wife was exhumed eleven months after death. The
coffin stood partly in water, the corpse was mummified. The organs
contained arsenic, the churchyard earth no arsenic. R. Koch was unable
to explain the preservation of the body, under these conditions, in
no other way than from the effect of arsenic; and this circumstance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
with others, was an important element which led to the conviction of
Speichert.</p>

<p>When arsenious acid is swallowed in substance or solution, the most
marked change is that in the mucous membrane of the stomach and
intestines; and, even when the poison has been absorbed by the skin,
or taken in any other way, there may be a very pronounced inflammatory
action. On the other hand, this is occasionally absent. Orfila<a name="FNanchor_747" id="FNanchor_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> relates
a case in which a man died in thirteen hours after having taken 12 grms.
of arsenious acid:&mdash;&#8220;The mucous membrane of the stomach presented
in its whole extent no trace of inflammation, no redness, and no alteration
of texture.&#8221; Many other similar cases are on record; and, according
to Harvey&#8217;s statistics, in 197 cases, 36 (about 18&middot;2 per cent.) presented no
lesion of the stomach.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>The usual changes produced by arsenious acid may be studied in the
museums of the London hospitals. In Guy&#8217;s Hospital Museum there
are three preparations. In preparation 1798<sup>32</sup> is seen a large stomach
with the mucous membrane at certain points abraded, and at the great
curvature the whole coats are thinned; it is also somewhat congested.
In preparation 1798<sup>64</sup> is a portion of coagulated lymph, from the stomach
of a lad, aged 14, who had taken accidentally a piece of cheese charged
with arsenious acid, prepared for the purpose of destroying rats. He
lived twenty-eight hours, and presented the ordinary symptoms. The
lymph has a membranous appearance, and the rug&aelig; of the stomach are
impressed upon it. It is said when recent to have presented numerous
bright bloody spots, although there was no visible breach of substance on
the surface of the stomach. The mucous membrane of the stomach is
stated to have been injected, and there was also diffuse injection of the
duodenum. Preparation 1798<sup>80</sup> is the stomach of a person who survived
thirteen hours after taking a fatal dose of arsenious acid; and in the
same museum there is a wax model of the appearances which the fresh
preparation exhibited, showing a large oval patch coated with mucus and
the poison. The stomach was intensely inflamed, the c&aelig;cum injected. The
rest of the intestine was healthy.</p>

<p>In the museum of University College there are two preparations, one<a name="FNanchor_748" id="FNanchor_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a>
exhibiting intense swelling and congestion of the gastric mucous membrane,
which is of a perfectly vermilion colour. Another preparation
(No. 2868) shows the effect of a small dose of arsenic on the stomach;
there are spots of arborescent extravasation, and slight congestion of
the summits of the rug&aelig;, but in other respects it is normal. There is
also a cast of Peyer&#8217;s patches from the same case, showing great prominence
of the glands, with some injection of the intestinal mucous
membrane.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_748" id="Footnote_748"></a><a href="#FNanchor_748"><span class="label">[748]</span></a> This preparation at the time of my visit had no number.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span></p>

<p>In St. Thomas&#8217; Hospital there is an interesting preparation (No. 8)
showing the gastric mucous membrane dotted all over with minute
ulcers, none of which have an inflammatory zone.<a name="FNanchor_749" id="FNanchor_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> I have not, however,
seen in any museum a preparation of the curious emphysematous
condition of the mucous membrane, which has more than once been
met with. For example, in a case related by Tardieu,<a name="FNanchor_750" id="FNanchor_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> Schwann, a
labourer, died from the effects of arsenic in thirty-six hours. The
autopsy showed that the mucous membrane of the stomach and small
intestine was covered with a pasty coating, and was elevated in nearly
its whole extent by bull&aelig; filled with gas, forming true emphysematous
swellings which encroached upon the diameter of the intestine. There
was neither redness nor ulceration, but the mucous membrane was
softened.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_749" id="Footnote_749"></a><a href="#FNanchor_749"><span class="label">[749]</span></a> In a case related by Orfila, t. i. Obs. xv., death resulted from
the outward application of arsenic; the mucous membrane of the stomach
was natural in colour, but there were four ulcers, one of which was 50
centimetres in diameter.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_750" id="Footnote_750"></a><a href="#FNanchor_750"><span class="label">[750]</span></a> <i>Op. cit.</i>, Obs. i. p. 468.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>The author saw, many years ago, at Barnard Castle, an autopsy made on
a gentleman who died from arsenic. In this case the mucous membrane
of the stomach presented a peculiar appearance, being raised here and
there by little blebs, and very slightly reddened.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_734" id="Sect_734"></a>&sect; 734. The inflammatory and other changes rarely affect the gullet.
Brodie<a name="FNanchor_751" id="FNanchor_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> never observed inflammation of the &#339;sophagus as an effect
of arsenic; but, when arsenic is swallowed in the solid state, as in the
suicide of Soufflard, graphically described by Orfila,<a name="FNanchor_752" id="FNanchor_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> it may be affected.
In Soufflard&#8217;s case there was a vivid injection of the pharynx and
gullet.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>In many instances, when the arsenic has been taken in the solid form,
the crystals with mucus and other matters adhere to the lining membrane.
I have seen in the stomach of a horse, poisoned by an ounce of
arsenic, an exquisite example of this. The inflammatory changes may be
recognised many months after death owing to the antiseptic properties of
arsenic; nevertheless, great caution is necessary in giving an opinion,
for there is often a remarkable redness induced by putrefactive changes
in healthy stomachs. Casper,<a name="FNanchor_753" id="FNanchor_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> on this point, very justly observes:&mdash;&#8220;If
Orfila quotes a case from Lepelletier, in which the inflammatory redness
of the mucous membrane of the stomach was to be recognised after nine
months&#8217; interment, and if Taylor cites two cases in which it was observed
nineteen and twenty-one months after death respectively, this is in contradiction
of all that I, on my part, have seen in the very numerous
exhumed corpses examined by me in relation to the gradual progress
of putrefaction and of saponification, and I cannot help here suspecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
a confusion with the putrefactive imbibition redness of the mucous
membrane.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>If examined microscopically, the liver and kidneys show no change,
save a fatty degeneration and infiltration of the epithelial cells. In the
muscular substance of the heart, under the endocardium, there is almost
constantly noticed ecchymosis. In the most acute cases, in which a
cholera-like diarrh&#339;a has exhausted the sufferer, the blood may be
thickened from loss of its aqueous constituents, and the whole of the
organs will present that singularly dry appearance found in all cases in
which there has been a copious draining away of the body fluids. In
the narcotic form of arsenical poisoning, the vessels of the brain have
been noted as congested, but this congestion is neither marked nor
pathognomonic. Among the rare pathological changes may be classed
glossitis, in which the whole tongue has swollen, and is found so large as
almost to fill the mouth. This has been explained, in one case, as caused
by solid arsenious acid having been left a little time in the mouth before
swallowing it. On the other hand, it has also been observed when the
poison has been absorbed from a cutaneous application. When arsenic has
been introduced into the vagina, the ordinary traces of inflammatory action
have been seen, and, even without direct contact, an inflammation of the
male and female sexual organs has been recorded, extending so far as
gangrene. As a rule, putrefaction is remarkably retarded, and is especially
slow in those organs which contain arsenic; so that, if the poison
has been swallowed, the stomach will retain its form, and, even to a
certain extent, its natural appearance, for an indefinite period. In corpses
long buried of persons dying from arsenical poisoning, the ordinary process
of decay gives place to a saponification, and such bodies present a striking
contrast to others buried in the same graveyard. This retardation of
putrefaction is what might, <i>&agrave; priori</i>, be expected, for arsenic has been
long in use as a preservative of organic tissues.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_735" id="Sect_735"></a>&sect; 735. <b>Physiological Action of Arsenic.</b>&mdash;The older view with regard
to the essential action of arsenic was, without doubt, that the effects were
mainly local, and that death ensued from the corrosive action on the
stomach and other tissues&mdash;a view which is in its entirety no longer
accepted; nevertheless, it is perfectly true that arsenic has a corrosive
local action; it will raise blisters on the skin, will inflame the tongue or
mucous membranes with which it comes in contact; and, in those rapid
cases in which extensive lesions have been found in the alimentary canal,
it can hardly be denied that instances of death have occurred more from
the local than the constitutional action. In the vast majority of cases,
however, there is certainly insufficient local action to account for death,
and we must refer the lethal result to a more profound and intimate
effect on the nervous centres. The curious fact, that, when arsenic is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
absorbed from a cutaneous surface or from a wound, the mucous membrane
of the stomach inflames, is explained by the absorption of the
arsenic into the blood and its separation by the mucous membrane, in its
passage exerting an irritant action. The diarrh&#339;a and hyper&aelig;mia of the
internal abdominal organs have been referred to a paralysis of the splanchnic
nerves, but Esser considers them due to an irritation of the ganglia
in the intestinal walls. Binz has advanced a new and original theory as
to the action of arsenious acid; he considers that the protoplasm of the
cells of many tissues possess the power of oxidising arsenious acid to
arsenic acid, and this arsenic acid is again, by the same agency, reduced
to arsenious acid, in this way, by the alternate oxidation and reduction
of the arsenious acid, the cells are decomposed, and a fatty degeneration
takes place. Thus arsenic causes fatty changes in the liver, kidney, and
other cells by a process analogous to the action of phosphorus. T. Araki<a name="FNanchor_754" id="FNanchor_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a>
also considers that both arsenic and phosphorus lessen oxidation, and
points out that lactic acid appears in the urine when either of these
poisons are taken, such acid being the result of insufficient oxidation. A
notable diminution of arterial pressure has been observed. In an experiment
by Hugo<a name="FNanchor_755" id="FNanchor_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> &middot;03 grm. of <span class="chemform">As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub></span> was injected intravenously, the
normal arterial pressure being 178 mm. Ten minutes after injection the
pressure sank to 47 mm.; in sixteen minutes it again rose to 127 mm.
Accumulative action of arsenic does not occur. Hebra has given, in skin
diseases, during many months, a total quantity of 12 grms. without evil
result.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_736" id="Sect_736"></a>&sect; 736. <b>Elimination of Arsenic.</b>&mdash;Arsenic is separated especially by
the urine,<a name="FNanchor_756" id="FNanchor_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> then through the bile, and by the perspiration. The eruption
often observed on the skin has been referred to the local action of small
quantities of arsenic in this way eliminated. It is found in the urine
first after from five to six hours, but the elimination from a single dose
is not finished till a period of from five to eight days; it has often been
looked for twelve days after taking it, but very seldom found. According
to Vitali, the arsenic in the urine is not free, but probably displaces
phosphorus in phospho-glyceric acid; possibly it may also replace
phosphorus in lecithin.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_756" id="Footnote_756"></a><a href="#FNanchor_756"><span class="label">[756]</span></a> An old experiment of Orfila&#8217;s has some practical bearings, and may
be cited here. A dog was treated by &middot;12 grm. of arsenious acid, and
supplied plentifully with liquid to drink; his urine, analysed from time
to time during ten days, gave abundant evidences of arsenic. On killing
the animal by hanging on the tenth day, no arsenic could be detected in
any of the organs of the body; it had been, as it were, washed out.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_737" id="Sect_737"></a>&sect; 737. <b>Antidote and Treatment.</b>&mdash;In any case in which there is
opportunity for <i>immediate</i> treatment, ferric hydrate should be administered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
as an antidote. Ferric hydrate converts the soluble arsenious acid
into the insoluble ferric arseniate, the ferric oxide being reduced to
ferrous oxide. It is necessary to use ferric hydrate recently prepared,
for if dried it changes into an oxyhydrate, or even if kept under water
the same change occurs, so that (according to the experiments of Messrs.
T. &amp; H. Smith) after four months the power of the moist mass is
reduced to one-half, and after five months to one-fourth.</p>

<p>It is obvious that ferric hydrate is not in the true sense of the word
an antidote, for it will only act when it comes in contact with the
arsenious acid; and, when once the poison has been removed from the
stomach by absorption into the tissues, the administration of the hydrate
is absolutely useless. Ferric hydrate may be readily prepared by adding
strong ammonia to the solution or tincture of ferric chloride, found in
every medical man&#8217;s surgery and in every chemist&#8217;s shop, care being taken
to add no caustic excess of ammonia; the liquid need not be filtered,
but should be at once administered. With regard to other methods of
medical treatment, they are simply those suggested by the symptoms and
well-known effects of the poison. When absorbed, the drinking of water
in excess cannot but assist its elimination by the kidneys.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_738" id="Sect_738"></a>&sect; 738. <b>Detection of Arsenic.</b>&mdash;The analyst may have to identify
arsenic in substance, in solution, in alloys, in wall-papers, in earth, and
in various animal, fatty, resinous, or other organic matters.</p>

<p><b>Arsenious Acid in Substance.</b>&mdash;The general characters of arsenious
acid have been already described, and are themselves so marked as to be
unmistakable. The following are the most conclusive tests:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1) A small fragment placed in the subliming cell (<a href="#Page_258">p. 258</a>), and heated
to about the temperature of 137&middot;7&deg; (286&deg; F.), at once sublimes in the
form of an amorphous powder, if the upper glass disc is cool; but if
heated (as it should be) to nearly the same temperature as the lower,
characteristic crystals are obtained, remarkable for their brilliancy and
permanency, and almost always distinct and separate. The prevailing form
is the regular octahedron, but the rhombic dodecahedron, the rectangular
prism, superimposed crystals, half crystals, deep triangular plates
like tetrahedra, and irregular and confused forms, all occasionally occur.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig589" id="Fig589"></a>
<img src="images/illo589.jpg" alt="Berzelius's apparatus" width="550" height="65" />
</div>

<p>(2) A beautiful and well-known test is that of Berzelius:&mdash;A small
hard-glass tube is taken, and the closed end drawn out to the size of a
knitting needle. Within the extreme point of this fine part is placed
the fragment (which may be no more than a milligramme) and a splinter
of charcoal, fine enough to enter freely the narrow part, as shown in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span>
<a href="#Fig589">figure</a>. The portion of the tube containing the charcoal (<i>e</i>) is first heated
until it glows, and then the extreme end; if arsenic is present, a mirror-like
coating is easily obtained in the broader portion of the tube (<i>d</i>).
That this coating is really arsenical can be established by the behaviour
of metallic crusts of arsenic towards solvents (as given at <a href="#Page_557">p. 557</a>). The
portion of the tube containing the crust may also be broken up, put in a
very short, wide test-tube (the mouth of which is occupied by a circle of
thin microscopic glass) and heated, when the arsenic will sublime on to
the glass disc, partly as a metal and partly as crystalline arsenious acid.</p>

<p>(3) Arsenious acid, itself inodorous, when heated on coal, after mixing
it with moist oxalate of potash, evolves a peculiar garlic-like odour. To
this test oxide of antimony adulterated with arsenic will respond, if there
is only a thousandth part present. Simply projecting arsenious acid on
either red-hot charcoal or iron produces the same odour.</p>

<p>(4) A little bit of arsenious acid, heated in a matrass with two or three
times its weight of acetate of potash, evolves the unsupportable odour
of kakodyl.</p>

<p><b>Arsenites and Arseniates</b>, mixed with oxalate of soda and heated in a
matrass, afford distinct mirrors, especially the arsenites of the earths and
silver; those of copper and iron are rather less distinct.</p>

<p><b>Sulphides of Arsenic</b> are reduced by any of the processes described on
<a href="#Page_573">p. 573</a> <i>et seq.</i></p>

<p><b>In Solution.</b>&mdash;An acid solution of arsenious acid gives, when treated
with <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>, a canary-yellow precipitate, soluble in ammonia, carbonate of
ammonia, and bisulphite of potash, and also a metallic sublimate when
heated in a tube with the reducing agents in the manner described at <a href="#Page_575">p.
575</a>. By these properties the sulphide is distinguished and, indeed,
separated from antimony, tin, and cadmium.</p>

<p>The sulphides of tin and cadmium are certainly also yellow, but the
latter is quite insoluble in ammonia, while the former gives no metallic
sublimate when heated with reducing substances.</p>

<p>The sulphide of antimony, again, is orange, and quite insoluble in
potassic bisulphite, and scarcely dissolves in ammonia.</p>

<p>A small piece of sodium amalgam placed in a test-tube or flask containing
an arsenic-holding liquid, or the liquid made alkaline with soda or
potash and a little bit of aluminium added, produces in a short time
arsine, which will blacken a piece of paper, soaked in nitrate of silver,
and inserted in the mouth of the flask. This is certainly the most convenient
test for arsenic. No antimoniuretted hydrogen (<i>stibine</i>) is given
off from an alkaline solution and no <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>.</p>

<p><b>Marsh&#8217;s Original Test for Arsenic</b> consisted in evolving nascent
hydrogen by zinc and sulphuric acid, and then adding the liquid to be
tested. The apparatus for Marsh&#8217;s test, in its simplest form, consists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
of a flask provided with a cork conveying two tubes, one a funnel reaching
nearly to the bottom of the flask; the other, a delivery tube, which
is of some length, is provided with a chloride of calcium bulb,<a name="FNanchor_757" id="FNanchor_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> and towards
the end is turned up at right angles, the end being narrowed. By
evolving hydrogen from zinc and sulphuric acid, and then adding portions
of the liquid through the funnel, arseniuretted hydrogen in a dry
state is driven along the leading tube, can be ignited on its issue, and on
depressing a piece of cold porcelain, a dark metallic spot of arsenic is
obtained.<a name="FNanchor_758" id="FNanchor_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> Or, if any portion of the tube be made red-hot, the metal
is deposited in the same way as a ring. The apparatus admits of much
complication and variety. One of the most useful additions is, perhaps,
the interposition of a small gasometer. This consists of a cylindrical
glass vessel with entrance and exit tubes, open at the bottom, immersed
in water in a larger vessel, and counterpoised by weights and rollers,
exactly like the large gasometers used at gasworks; the exit tube must
have a stop-cock, and the gas must pass over calcic chloride in order to
dry it thoroughly.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_757" id="Footnote_757"></a><a href="#FNanchor_757"><span class="label">[757]</span></a> Otto recommends the first half of the drying tube connected with
the development flask to be filled with caustic potash, the latter half
with chloride of calcium (<i>Ausmittelung der Gifte</i>). Dragendorff
approves of this, but remarks that it should be used when arsenic alone
is searched for, since caustic potash decomposes stibine. The potash
fixes <span class="chemform">SH<sub class="tab">2</sub></span>, and prevents the formation of chloride of arsenic; on the
other hand, it absorbs some little <span class="chemform">AsH<sub class="tab">3</sub></span>.</p>

<p>M. Blondlot has observed<a name="FNanchor_759" id="FNanchor_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> that if pure zinc, a weak solution of arsenious
acid, and a sulphuric acid containing nitric acid or nitrous compounds,
be mixed together, the arsenic passes into a solid hydrate, which is
deposited on the surface of the zinc; this is, however, prevented by the
addition of a little stannous chloride dissolved in hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span></p>

<p>The mirror or crust of arsenic is usually described and weighed as
being composed of the pure metal, but J. W. Rettgers has investigated
the matter, and the following is an abstract of his results:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>There is no amorphous form of arsenic, the variety generally thus
called being crystalline. Two modifications can be distinguished: the
one being a hexagonal silver-white variety possessed of metallic lustre,
specifically heavier and less volatile than the second kind, which
is black in colour, crystallises apparently in the regular system,
and constitutes the true arsenic mirror. The former modification
corresponds to red hexagonal phosphorus (red phosphorus having been
recently proved by the author to be crystalline), and the latter to yellow
phosphorus, which crystallises in the regular system. Both modifications
of arsenic are perfectly opaque; deposits which are yellow or brown, and
more or less transparent, consist of the suboxide and hydride, <span class="chemform">As<sub>2</sub>O</span>
and <span class="chemform">AsH</span>. The brown spot on porcelain produced by contact with a
flame of arseniuretted hydrogen is not a thin film of As, but one of the
brown solid hydride <span class="chemform">AsH</span>, formed by the decomposition of <span class="chemform">AsH<sub>3</sub></span>. This
view is confirmed by the fact that arsenic sublimed in an indifferent gas
(<i>e.g.</i>, <span class="chemform">CO<sub>2</sub></span>) is deposited in one or other of the modifications described
above, the brown transparent product being obtained only in the presence
of H or O. Moreover, pure arsenic is insoluble in all solvents, whereas
the film on porcelain (<span class="chemform">AsH</span>) is soluble in many solvents, including
hydrocarbons of the benzene series (<i>e.g.</i>, xylene), warm methylene iodide,
and hot caustic potash.</p>

<p>Hence quantitative results from weighing arsenical mirrors can never
be accurate, because the mirrors consist of mixtures of hydride and
suboxide.</p>

<p><b>Reinsch&#8217;s Test.</b>&mdash;A piece of bright copper foil, boiled in an acid
liquid containing either arsenic or antimony, or both, becomes coated
with a dark deposit of antimony or arsenic, as the case may be. The
arsenical stain, according to Lippert, is a true alloy, consisting of 1 arsenic
to 5 copper.<a name="FNanchor_765" id="FNanchor_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> Properly applied, the copper will withdraw every trace of
arsenic or antimony from a solution. Dr. John Clark<a name="FNanchor_766" id="FNanchor_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a> has lately introduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>
some improvements in Reinsch&#8217;s process. His experiments have
been directed to the means of proving the presence of arsenic or antimony
in the stain on the copper with greater certainty, and at the same
time estimating the amount when they occur together.</p>

<p>The material to be tested is boiled gently in a porcelain vessel with
dilute hydrochloric acid and a small strip of copper about 1 inch long
by <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inch broad, till the absence of arsenic or antimony has been ascertained,
or a coating has been produced. When the coating is decided,
the piece of copper is taken out, washed first with water, then with a
little alcohol to get rid of fatty matter, and finally with water. It is
then placed in a mixture of dilute caustic potash and peroxide of hydrogen,
and allowed to digest in the cold. At the same time a second piece of
copper is introduced into the material which has given a deposit on the first
piece, the washings of the first piece being added, and the boiling continued.</p>

<p>The treatment of the first piece of copper by caustic potash and peroxide
of hydrogen dissolves any antimony or arsenic and restores the
copper to its original brightness; when this is accomplished, the second
piece of copper is taken out and replaced by the first, and this second
piece, if stained, is digested with potash, peroxide of hydrogen, and
washed as in the former case. The process is repeated until the slips of
copper cease to be stained in the slightest degree&mdash;until, in short, the
whole arsenic or antimony has been withdrawn.</p>

<p>The alkaline liquid contains the arsenic, as arsenate of potassium; the
antimony, if present, as antimonate; and the solution is also contaminated
by a little hydrated copper oxide; this latter separates on
boiling, and can be filtered off, and the filtrate is boiled down to a small
bulk. The liquid is washed into a small distillation-flask with strong
hydrochloric acid, ferrous chloride is added, the flask, fitted with a safety
tube, is connected with a condenser, and the arsenic distilled into water.
To obtain the last traces of arsenic it may be necessary to distil it twice
in this way, adding, each time, fresh strong acid and distilling to dryness.
The distillate is then tested for arsenic by adding an equal bulk
of saturated <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span> water. The sulphide of arsenic may be dealt with as
described (<a href="#Page_573">p. 573</a>).</p>

<p>The residue in the flask is now tested for antimony by saturating with
<span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>; should antimony be present, the precipitate by <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span> will probably
be dark coloured, because of a small quantity of copper. The precipitate
is collected, dissolved in dilute caustic soda, boiled, filtered to remove
copper sulphide, the filtrate acidified by hydrochloric acid, and sulphuretted
hydrogen water added. If antimony was present, this time the
precipitate will be of an orange colour, and may be dealt with as
described (<a href="#Page_589">p. 589</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span></p>

satisfactory.</p>

with a disc of filter-paper previously moistened with one or two drops of

<p><a name="Sect_740" id="Sect_740"></a>&sect; 740. <b>Arsenic in Organic Matters.</b>&mdash;Orfila and the older school of
chemists took the greatest care, in searching for arsenic, to destroy the
last trace of organic matter. Orfila&#8217;s practice was to chop up the substance
and make it into a paste with 400 to 700 grms. of water; to this
&middot;010 grm. <span class="chemform">KHO</span> in alcohol was added, and &middot;020 grm. of potassic nitrate.
The substances were heated up to from 80&deg; to 90&deg; for some time, until
they were pretty well dissolved; the organic matter was then burnt off
in a Hessian crucible heated to redness, on which small quantities of the
matters were placed at a time. When the whole had thus been submitted
to red heat, the melted mass was run into an almost red-hot
porcelain basin, and allowed to cool. Afterwards, it was again heated
with concentrated sulphuric acid, until all nitric and nitrous fumes were
dissipated; on dissolving and filtering in water, the liquid was introduced
into a Marsh&#8217;s apparatus. Orfila never seems to have failed in
detecting arsenic by this process. For an organ like the liver, he considered
that 100 grms. of potash and 86 of strong sulphuric acid were
necessary in order to destroy the organic matters.</p>

<p>The liability of the various reagents used to impurity, and the probability
of loss in these operations, have tended to discredit destruction of
the organic matter by a red heat, and chemists generally have preferred
to oxidise animal matters by a moist process. The organic substance is
divided finely and digested with dilute hydrochloric acid, and from time
to time crystals of potassic chlorate are thrown in until all the fluid is
very thin and capable of passing through a filter. The filtrate must
now be submitted to the prolonged action of sulphuretted hydrogen,<a name="FNanchor_768" id="FNanchor_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> and
the sulphide of arsenic separated from free sulphur by dissolving in sodic
sulphide. After filtering, the arsenic sulphide may be again thrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>
down by the addition of hydrochloric acid, collected on a filter, and still
further purified by solution in ammonic carbonate; once more precipitated
by hydrochloric acid, and lastly identified by conversion into
magnesia pyro-arseniate (see <a href="#Page_572">p. 572</a>). The above process is a general and
safe way of detecting arsenic in almost any organic tissue, but the author
prefers the distillation process described <a href="#Page_575">p. 575</a> <i>et seq.</i></p>

<p>Oils and matters consisting almost entirely of fat, suspected of containing

matter they may contain; the oil is then decanted, and, if necessary,
filtered from any deposit; saponified by alcoholic potash, the soap

for both in the first deposit and in the solution, now fairly free from fat,
and easy to treat.</p>

<p>Brodie long ago stated that when arsenious acid had been given in
solution to any animal capable of vomiting, no arsenic could be detected
in the stomach; this statement is too absolute, but in the majority of
cases true.</p>

<p>In all cases the chemist should have portions of the brain, spinal cord,
liver, kidneys, lungs, and muscular tissue, as well as the stomach and its
contents.</p>

<p>According to the experiments of Scolosuboff,<a name="FNanchor_770" id="FNanchor_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> arsenic is generally
greatest in the marrow, then in the brain, next in the liver, and least in

<p>With regard to the preliminary treatment of the stomach and fluids submitted
to the analyst, the careful noting of appearances, the decantation,

are precautions so obviously dictated by common sense, that they need
only be alluded to in passing. Of some considerable moment is the
question which may be put to the analyst in court, in reference to the
possible entrance of arsenic into the living body, by accidental and, so to
speak, <i>subtle</i> means. Such are the inhaling of the fumes from the burning
of arsenical candles,<a name="FNanchor_774" id="FNanchor_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> and of emanations from papers (see <a href="#Page_541">p. 541</a>),<a name="FNanchor_775" id="FNanchor_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> as

various sources, such as arsenical earth, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_776" id="FNanchor_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_775" id="Footnote_775"></a><a href="#FNanchor_775"><span class="label">[775]</span></a> To solve this question, it has been at times considered necessary
to analyse an extraordinary number of things. In the &#8220;affaire Danval&#8221;
(<i>Journ. d&#8217;Hygi&egrave;ne</i>, 2e s&eacute;r., No. 108, July 1878), more than sixty
different articles, comprising drugs, drinks, perfumes, bed-curtains,
wall-paper, and other matters, were submitted to the experts.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_776" id="Footnote_776"></a><a href="#FNanchor_776"><span class="label">[776]</span></a> The following important case is related by Sonnenschein:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Nicholas Nobel and his wife, Jerome, were buried two metres from each
other in the churchyard at Spinal, the earth of which notoriously
contained arsenic. A suspicion of poisoning arose. The bodies were
exhumed, and arsenic was found in the stomach and intestines of Nobel,
but not the slightest trace in the corpse of the wife. The remains of
the bodies were reinterred, and after six months, on a fresh suspicion
of poisoning arising, again exhumed. The corpse of the woman had been
put naked in the moist earth during a heavy shower, but this time also
no arsenic was detected in it.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_741" id="Sect_741"></a>&sect; 741. <b>Imbibition of Arsenic after Death.</b>&mdash;The arguments which are
likely to be used, in favour of a corpse having become arsenical may be
gathered from a case related by Sonnenschein:&mdash;Certain bodies were
exhumed in two churchyards; the evidence went to show that they had
been poisoned by arsenic, and this substance was actually found in the
bodies, while at the same time it was discovered to exist also in traces in
the earth of the churchyard. The theory for the defence was, that
although the arsenic in the earth was in an insoluble state, yet that it
might combine with lime as an arsenite of lime; this arsenite would
become soluble by the action of carbonic acid set free by vegetation, and
filter down to the corpse. Sonnenschein suspended a quantity of this
earth in water, and passed <span class="chemform">CO<sub>2</sub></span> through it for twelve hours; on filtering,
the liquid gave no evidence of arsenic. A similar result was obtained
when an artificial mixture of 1 grm. of arsenious acid and 1 pound of
earth were submitted to the same process.</p>

<p>The fact would appear to stand thus: oxide of iron in ordinary earth
retains arsenic, and requires treatment with a concentrated acid to dissolve
it. It therefore follows that, if a defence of arsenical earth is
likely to be set up, and the analyst finds that by mere extraction of the
tissues by <i>water</i> he can detect arsenic, the defence is in all probability
unsound. The expert should, of course, deal with this question on its
merits, and without prejudice. According to Eulenberg,<a name="FNanchor_777" id="FNanchor_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> in arsenical
earth&mdash;if, after having been crushed and washed, it lies for some time
exposed to the disintegrating action of the air&mdash;soluble arsenical salts are
formed, which may find their way into brooks and supplies of drinking
water. We may infer that it is hardly probable (except under very
peculiar circumstances) for a corpse to be contaminated internally with
an estimable quantity of arsenic from the traces of arsenic met with in a
few churchyards.</p>

<p>It occasionally happens that an exhumation is ordered a very long
time after death, when no organs or parts (save the bones) are to be
distinguished. In the case of a man long dead, the widow confessing
that she had administered poison, the bones were analysed by Sonnenschein,
and a small quantity of arsenic found. Coni&egrave;rbe and Orfila have
both asserted that arsenic is a normal constituent of the bones&mdash;a statement

several others in a similar way, without finding the least trace of arsenic.

he find arsenic in the bones, must be formed from the amount discovered,

<p>The deceased, a farmer, bachelor, sixty-five years of age, and in good health, was
taken violently sick shortly after breakfast, with vomiting and distress in the
stomach. Although a physician was summoned, the symptoms increased in severity,
and a little after midnight death ensued. The funeral took place three days later.
Certain very damaging pieces of circumstantial evidence having been collected, the

white arsenic.</p>

<p>Thirty-five days after death (from March 20 to April 25) the body was exhumed,
and found in a state of remarkable preservation, and free from cadaveric smell. The

<p>The amount of arsenic recovered and produced in court was in quantity sufficient
to produce death. Some time after the analytical report was made to the coroner, it
was learned that an embalming fluid, highly arsenical in character, had been used
upon the body by the undertaker at the time of preparation for burial. No injection
of this embalming fluid was practised, but cloths wrung out in the fluid were laid
upon the face and chest, and were kept constantly wet therewith during a period of
many hours. In all about two quarts of embalming fluid were so used. Its composition
appeared to be a strongly acidified solution of sodium arsenite and zinc sulphate.
Only the arsenic and zinc were determined quantitatively, and they were
found to be, zinc (metallic), 1&middot;978 per cent., and arsenic (metallic), 1&middot;365 per cent. by
weight. An amount of this fluid measuring 15&middot;7 c.c. would thus contain a weight
of arsenic equal to that actually recovered from the body.</p>

<p>Extended medical testimony was offered by the prosecution, tending to show that,
under the given circumstances, no fluid of any kind could have reached the stomach
through the nose or mouth after death, thus anticipating what the defence afterwards
claimed, that the undertaker was responsible for the arsenic discovered in the
remains.</p>

<p>In order to gather further light upon the possibility of cadaveric imbibition of
embalming fluid through the unbroken skin, test was made for zinc in the heart and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>
stomach, and distinct traces of the metal were found in each instance. That at
least a portion of the arsenic found in the body was due to <i>post-mortem</i> causes was
thus distinctly proven. A weighed portion (62 grms.) of the stomach and contents was
then most carefully analysed quantitatively for both zinc and arsenic with the following
results:&mdash;Arsenic, 0&middot;0648 grm., and zinc, 0&middot;0079 grm. Bearing in mind the
relative quantities of the two metals in the embalming fluid, it will be seen that the
arsenic found in the 62 grms. of the stomach was nearly twelve times larger than it
should have been to have balanced the zinc which was also present. This fact,
together with the discovery of crystals of white arsenic in the stomach, constituted
the case for the prosecution, so far as the chemical evidence was concerned.</p>

<p>The defence made an unsuccessful effort to show that the crystals of the tri-oxide
originated from the spontaneous evaporation of the embalming fluid. The prosecution
met this point by proving that such fluid had been abundantly experimented
upon by exposure to a very low temperature during an interval of several months,
and also by spontaneous evaporation with a view of testing that very question, and
that the results had in every case been negative. Special importance was given these
experiments, because of the well-known separation of octahedral crystals during the
spontaneous evaporation of a hydrochloric acid solution of the white oxide, it having
also appeared that, in the manufacture of the embalming fluid, the arsenic was used
as white arsenic.</p>

<p>A very strong point was finally raised for the defence by the inability of the
expert on the side of the prosecution to state positively whether or not an embalming
fluid of the above composition would diffuse as a whole through dead tissue, or
its several parts would be imbibed at different rates of speed, the zinc portion becoming
arrested by albuminoid material and being therefore outstripped by the arsenic,
or <i>vice versa</i>. The prisoner was ultimately acquitted.</p>

</div><!--blockquote-->

<p>In a case which occurred in the Western States of America, there was
good reason for believing that arsenic had been introduced into the corpse
of a man <i>after</i> his decease. With regard to the imbibition of arsenic
thus introduced, Orfila<a name="FNanchor_780" id="FNanchor_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a> says:&mdash;&#8220;I have often introduced into the
stomach (as well as the rectum) of the corpses of men and dogs 2 to 3
grms. of arsenious acid, dissolved in from 400 to 500 grms. of water, and
have examined the different viscera at the end of eight, ten, or twenty
days. Constantly I have recognised the effects of cadaveric imbibition.
Sections of the liver or other organs which touch the digestive canal,
carefully cut and analysed, furnished arsenic, which could not be obtained
sensibly (or not at all) from sections which had not been in contact with
this canal. If the corpse remained long on the back after arsenious acid
had been introduced into the stomach, I could obtain this metal from the
left half of the diaphragm and from the inferior lobe of the left lung, whilst
I did not obtain it from other portions of the diaphragm nor from the
right lung.&#8221; Dr. Reece has also made some experiments on the imbibition
of arsenic after death. He injected solutions of arsenious acid into
the stomach of various warm-blooded animals, and found at various
periods arsenic, not alone in the intestinal canal, but also in the spleen,
liver, and kidneys.</p>

distilled until frothing stops any farther distillation. A further quantity
of 100 c.c. <span class="chemform">HCl</span> is then added, and distilled over. The receiver, in each
case, contains water, and must be kept cool. The united distillates are

<p><a name="Sect_743" id="Sect_743"></a>&sect; 743. <b>Estimation of Arsenic.</b>&mdash;Most of the methods for the quantitative
determination of arsenic are also excellent tests for its presence.
It may be regarded, indeed, as an axiom in legal chemistry, that the
precise amount of every substance detected, if it can be weighed or
estimated by any process whatever, should be accurately stated. Indefinite
expressions, such as &#8220;a small quantity was found,&#8221; &#8220;traces were
detected,&#8221; &amp;c., are most objectionable. The more perfect of the methods
of evolving arsenic can be made quantitative. For example, the galvanic
process introduced by Bloxam may be utilised as follows:&mdash;A fractional
part of the arsenical solution is taken for the experiment; the bottom of
a narrow-necked bottle of about 100 c.c. capacity is removed, and replaced
by a piece of vegetable parchment. The neck of the bottle carries a
cork, which is pierced by (1) a platinum wire, which is attached to a
platinum electrode; (2) a short tube, bent at right angles, and connected
by piping with a longer tube, which has also a rectangular bend, and
dips into a solution of silver nitrate; (3) an ordinary funnel-tube, reaching
nearly to the bottom. The bottle is placed in a beaker of such a
size as to leave a small interval between the two, and the whole apparatus
stands in a large vessel of cold water. Dilute sulphuric acid is now put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>
into the bottle, and also into the beaker, so that the fluid reaches exactly
the same level in each. The positive platinum electrode of a battery of
six of Grove&#8217;s cells, or other efficient combination, is immersed in the
liquid outside the bottle, connection with the negative plate is established,
and hydrogen very soon comes off, and passes over into the nitrate of
silver solution. When all the air is expelled, a portion of the rectangular
tube is heated to redness, and if there is no stain nor any reduction of
the silver, the acid is pure. If the gas is passed for a long time into
the silver solution, the silver will be reduced to some extent by the
hydrogen, although arsenic-free;<a name="FNanchor_783" id="FNanchor_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> so that it is better to rely upon the
metallic ring or stain, which is certain to be formed on heating a portion
of the tube red-hot, and keeping it at that temperature for <i>at least ten
minutes</i>. The liquid is then passed through the funnel in successive
portions; if arsenic is present, there will be a decided metallic ring on
heating the tube as before, and if antimony is present, there will also be a
stain; the distinctions between these stains have been described at <a href="#Page_557">p. 557</a>.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_783" id="Footnote_783"></a><a href="#FNanchor_783"><span class="label">[783]</span></a> Nitrate of silver solution is reduced by <span class="chemform">H<sub class="tab">2</sub></span>, <span class="chemform">CH<sub class="tab">3</sub></span>, <span class="chemform">PH<sub class="tab">3</sub></span>,
and <span class="chemform">SbH<sub class="tab">3</sub></span>; hence it is absolutely necessary in any qualitative
examination to prove that arsenious acid has actually been produced in
the silver solution.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>The tube is kept red-hot until the stain is very distinct; then the source
of heat is removed, and the gas allowed to bubble through the argentic
nitrate solution, which it decomposes, as before detailed (<a href="#Page_526">p. 526</a>). This
process is continued until, on placing the delivery tube in a sample of
clear nitrate of silver solution, there is no darkening of colour. In certain
cases this may take a long time, but the apparatus, once set to work,
requires little superintendence. At the conclusion, the whole of the
arsenic is separated,&mdash;part is in the silver solution as arsenious acid, part
in the tube as a ring of metallic arsenic. The portion of the tube containing
the metallic arsenic should be cut off with a file and weighed, the
arsenic then removed and re-weighed; the loss is the metal approximately.
Or, the weight of the film may be estimated by having a set of similar
deposits of known weight or quantities, in tubes exactly corresponding to
those used in the analysis, and comparing or matching them.</p>

<p>The arsenious acid in the nitrate of silver may be dealt with in several
ways. The equation given (<a href="#Page_526">p. 526</a>) shows clearly that pure arsine, passed
into nitrate of silver solution, decomposes it in such a manner that, if
either the silver deposited or the free acid is estimated, the quantity of
arsenic can from such data be deduced. In operating on organic liquids,
ammonia and other products may be given off, rendering either of the
indirect processes inadvisable. A very convenient method, applicable in
many cases, is to throw out the silver by hydrochloric acid, alkalise the
filtrate by bicarbonate of soda, and titrate with iodine solution. The
latter is made by dissolving exactly 12&middot;7 grms. of pure dry iodine by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span>
aid of 18 grms. of potassic iodide in one litre of water, observing that
the solution must take place in the cold, without the application of heat.
The principle of the titration is, that arsenious acid, in the presence of
water and free alkali, is converted into arsenic acid<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="chemreact">As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 4I + 2Na<sub>2</sub>O = As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> + 4NaI.</p>

<p>The end of the reaction is known by adding a little starch-paste to the
solution; as soon as a blue colour appears, the process is finished.</p>

<p>Another convenient way by which (in very dilute solutions of arsenious
acid) the arsenic may be determined, is a colorimetric method, which
depends on the fact that sulphuretted hydrogen, when arsenious acid is
present in small quantity, produces no precipitate at first, but a yellow

the suspected matters, cut up into small pieces, are heated in a porcelain
dish of suitable size, stirred by means of a glass rod with 23 c.c. of pure
concentrated nitric acid, and heated up to from 150&deg; to 160&deg;. When the
matters assume a yellow or orange colour, the bath is removed from the
source of heat, and 3 c.c. of pure concentrated sulphuric acid added, and
the mixture stirred, when the mass becomes brown, swells up, and
evolves dense nitrous and other fumes. The vessel is again heated to
180&deg;, and while hot 8 c.c. of pure concentrated nitric acid are added, drop
by drop, with continual stirring. After this addition, it is heated to 200&deg;
for fifteen minutes, and the result on cooling is a hard carbonaceous
residue wholly free from nitric acid. The arsenic is in this way oxidised
into arsenic acid, which is easily soluble in water. The contents of the
dish are, therefore, perfectly extracted by boiling water, the aqueous
extract filtered, and evaporated to dryness. The next process is to obtain

<p>The flask, a Bunsen&#8217;s wash-bottle of 200 c.c. capacity, is provided with
a small separating funnel of 65 c.c. capacity, with glass stop-cock. This
is a very material aid to the obtaining of a slow and even evolution of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>
gas, an important desideratum when all loss is to be avoided; for with
only a funnel tube, every time a small portion of fluid is added, a sudden
rush of gas takes place, with probably a small, but still more or less
appreciable, loss. But the separating funnel, filled with the acid mixture,
can be so arranged as to give a constant and regular supply of fluid at the
rate of two or three drops per minute, more or less. The gas generated is
dried by a calcic chloride tube, and then passes through a tube of hard glass,
heated to a red heat by a miniature furnace of three Bunsen lamps with
spread burners, so that a continuous flame of 6 inches is obtained, and
with a proper length of cooled tube not a trace of arsenic passes by. The
glass tube where heated is wound with a strip of wire gauze, both ends
being supported upon the edges of the lamp frame, so that the tube does
not sink down when heated. The small furnace is provided with two
appropriate side pieces of sheet metal, so that a steady flame is always
obtained. When the quantity of arsenic is very small, the tube is naturally
so placed that the mirror is deposited in the narrow portion; but
when the arsenic is present to the extent of 0&middot;005 grm., the tube should
be 6 mm. in inner diameter, and so arranged that fully 2 inches of this
large tube are between the flame and the narrow portion. When the
quantity of arsenic is less, the tube can naturally be smaller.</p>

<p>25 to 35 grms. of granulated zinc, previously alloyed with a small quantity
of platinum, are placed in the generator, and everything being in
position, the apparatus is filled with hydrogen by the use of a small
quantity of acid No. 2. After a sufficient time has elapsed, the gas is
lighted at the jet, and the glass tube heated to a bright redness.</p>

<p>The arsenical solution in concentrated form is mixed with 45 c.c. of
acid No. 2, and the mixture passed into the separating funnel, from
which it is allowed to flow into the generator at such a rate that the
entire fluid is introduced in one hour or one and a half; 40 c.c. of acid
No. 3 are then added and allowed to flow slowly into the generator, and,
lastly, 45 c.c. of acid No. 4. The amount of time required will vary
with the amount of arsenic: 2 to 3 mgrms. of arsenic will require
about two to three hours for the entire decomposition, while 4 to 5 mgrms.
will need perhaps three to four hours. Where the amount of arsenic is
small, only 25 grms. of zinc are needed, and but 45 c.c. of acid No. 2,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span>

2 to 6 grms. weight is obtained. This is carefully weighed, and then
the arsenic removed by simple heating; or, if the arsenic is to be saved
(as in a toxicological case), dissolved out with strong nitric acid. The
tube is then cleaned, dried, and again weighed, the difference giving the
weight of metallic arsenic, from which, by a simple calculation, the amount
of arsenious oxide can be obtained. Some test results are given as

<p>Sanger estimates and tests for minute quantities of arsenic by the
Marsh-Berzelius process, and uses a generator of hydrogen; that is to
say, the hydrogen is evolved in the ordinary way from zinc and sulphuric
acid, and the issuing gas dried by calcic chloride; but into this flask is
also delivered from another flask, charged with sulphuric acid and zinc,
pure hydrogen, so that into the second flask, little by little, may be added
the solution to be tested; and, owing to the generating flask, the gas
may be made to give a uniform current, and at the end of the operation
all arsine swept out. To estimate the quantities of arsenic in the gas,
the reduction tube is heated, and a mirror or mirrors obtained, and compared
with a set of standard mirrors. The standard mirrors are made as
follows:&mdash;One grm. of arsenious oxide, purified by repeated sublimation,
is dissolved with the aid of a little sodic bicarbonate, and, after acidification
with dilute sulphuric acid, made up to 1 litre. This standard
solution contains 1 mgrm. of <span class="chemform">As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub></span> in every c.c., and is used to make a
second standard solution, containing 0&middot;01 mgrm., to every c.c., by diluting
10 c.c. to a litre. Of this last solution, 1 c.c., 2 c.c., 3 c.c., and so on, are
measured and introduced into the reduction flask, and the standard mirrors
obtained. It is recommended, for obvious reasons, to make more than
one standard for each quantity, for the appearance of the mirrors from
the same amount of arsenic varies. The tubes are hermetically sealed,
and, when not in use, kept in the dark.</p>

<p>This process is convenient for small amounts of arsenic; but, as stated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
before, the results are given as metallic arsenic, whereas the films appear
never to be composed of pure metallic arsenic, but a mixture of hydride

discovered in 1851 that arsenic, mixed with finely divided zinc, and excess
of soda or potash added, evolved arsine; but no stibine was evolved under
the same conditions. In 1873 J. W. Gatehouse suggested the use of
aluminium and sodic hydrate as a modification of Fleitmann&#8217;s test, for the
purpose of distinguishing between arsenic and antimony; and this is now
the usual process adopted. The hydrogen comes off regularly even in the
cold, but it is best to apply a little heat. This test will evolve arsine from
arsenious acid, and also from arsenic trisulphide; but it is not available
for the detection of arsenic, when the arsenic is in the form of arsenic acid.
According to Clark,<a name="FNanchor_786" id="FNanchor_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> it is not adapted for quantitative purposes, because,
owing to the formation of solid hydride, about one-fifth remains behind.</p>

<p>E. W. Davy, in 1876, proposed the use of sodium amalgam for the
generation of arsine; on the whole, it is, however, not so convenient as
the aluminium process.</p>

<p>The liquid to be tested is made strongly alkaline with pure sodic or
potassic hydrate placed in a flask connected with a tube dipping into a
4 per cent. solution of silver nitrate, a few pieces of sheet aluminium
added, and the flask gently heated; any arsine present will reduce the
silver. The silver solution thus blackened may be treated in the manner
described (<a href="#Page_567">p. 567</a>).</p>

<p><a name="Sect_746" id="Sect_746"></a>&sect; 746. <b>Precipitation as Tersulphide.</b>&mdash;Despite the advantages of some
of the processes described, which are (to a certain extent) easy and
accurate, not a few chemists still prefer the old method of precipitation
with hydric sulphide <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>, because, although tedious, it has stood the
test of experience. If this be used, it is well in most cases to pass
sulphurous anhydride through the liquid until it smells strongly of the
gas, for by this means any arsenic acid present is reduced, the sulphurous
anhydride is quickly got rid of by a current of carbonic anhydride, and
then the liquid is saturated with hydric sulphide. In the ordinary way,
much time is often wasted in saturating the liquid with this gas. Those,
however, who have large laboratories, and daily employ hydric sulphide,
possess (or should possess) a water saturated with the gas under pressure;
such a liquid, added in equal volume to an arsenical solution, is able to
convert the whole of the arsenic into sulphide in a very few minutes.
Those who do not possess this hydric sulphide water can saturate in an
hour the liquid to be tested, by passing the gas in under pressure.<a name="FNanchor_787" id="FNanchor_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span>
convenient method is to evolve <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span> from sulphide of antimony and <span class="chemform">ClH</span>;
the gas passes first into a wash-bottle, and then into a strong flask containing
the solution under trial. This flask is furnished with a safety-valve,
proportioned to the strength of the apparatus; the two tubes
dipping into the wash-bottle and the last flask are provided with Bunsen&#8217;s
valves, which only allow the gas to pass in one direction. The hydric
sulphide is then driven over by heat, and when sufficient gas has in this
way passed into the liquid, the flame is withdrawn, and the apparatus
allowed to stand for some hours, the valves preventing any backward
flow of the liquid or gas. When the precipitate has settled to the bottom,
the supernatant fluid is carefully passed through a filter, and the precipitate
washed by decantation in the flask, without transference to the filter,
if it can be avoided.</p>

<p>The solubility of the magnesium arseniate itself, and the general dislike
which chemists have to weighing in such hygroscopic material as a filter,
are, perhaps, the main reasons for the variation of this old method, which
has lately come into notice. Rose proposed some time ago the conversion
of the double salt into the pyro-arseniate&mdash;a method condemned by
Fresenius and Parnell, but examined and pronounced a practicable and
accurate process by Remol, Rammelsberg, Thorpe, Fuller, Wittstein,

<p>The precipitation is effected by magnesia mixture, with the addition of

<p>The precipitate is now dried, and transferred as completely as possible

<p>(<i>d</i>) <b>Conversion of the Sulphide into Metallic Arsenic.</b>&mdash;If there
should be any doubt as to the nature of the precipitated substances, the
very best way of resolving this doubt is to reduce the sulphide to metal;
the easiest method of proving this is to dissolve in potash and obtain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>
arsine by the action of aluminium; or if it is desired to evolve arsine
from an acid solution with zinc in the usual way, then by dissolving
a slight excess of zinc oxide in potash or soda, and dissolving in this the
arsenic sulphide; the zinc combines with all the sulphur, and converts
the sulpharsenite into arsenite; the zinc sulphide is filtered off, and the
filtrate acidified and introduced into Marsh&#8217;s apparatus. The original
process of Fresenius was to mix the sulphide with carbonate of soda
and cyanide of potassium, and place the mixture in the wide part of a
tube of hard German glass, drawn out at one end to a capillary fineness.
Carbonic anhydride, properly dried, was passed through the tube, and
the portion containing the mixture heated to redness; in this way the
arsenical sulphide was reduced, and the metal condensed in the capillary
portion, where the smallest quantity could be recognised. A more
elaborate and accurate process, based on the same principles, has been
advocated by Mohr.<a name="FNanchor_793" id="FNanchor_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a></p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>A convenient quantity of carbonate of soda is added to the sulphide,
and the whole mixed with a very little water, and gently warmed. The
yellow precipitate is very soon dissolved, and then the whole is evaporated
carefully, until it is in a granular, somewhat moist, adhesive state. It is
now transferred to a glass tube, open at top and bottom, but the top
widened into a funnel; this tube is firmly held perpendicularly on a
glass plate, and the prepared sulphide hammered into a compact cylinder
by the aid of a glass rod, which just fits the tube. The cylinder is now
dried over a flame, until no more moisture is to be detected, and then
transferred into a glass tube 4 or 5 inches long, and with one end
drawn to a point (the weight of this tube should be first accurately
taken). The tube is connected with the following series:&mdash;(1) A chloride
of calcium tube; (2) a small bottle containing nitrate of silver solution;
(3) a hydrogen-generating bottle containing zinc and sulphuric acid. The
hydrogen goes through the argentic nitrate solution, leaving behind any
sulphur and arsenic it may contain; it is then dried by chloride of
calcium, and streams in a pure dry state over the cylinder of prepared
sulphide (no error with regard to impurities in the gas is likely to occur;
but in rigid inquiries it is advisable to heat a portion of the tube, previous
to the insertion of the cylinder, for some time, in order to prove the
absence of any external arsenical source); when it is certain that pure
hydrogen, unmixed with air, is being evolved, the portion of the tube
in which the cylinder rests is heated slowly to redness, and the
metallic arsenic sublimes at a little distance from the source of heat.
Loss is inevitable if the tube is too short, or the stream of hydrogen too
powerful.</p>

<p>The tube after the operation is divided, the portion soiled by the soda<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[575]</a></span>
thoroughly cleansed, and then both parts weighed; the difference between
the weight of the empty tube and the tube + arsenic gives the metallic
arsenic. This is the process as recommended by Mohr; it may, however,
be pointed out that the glass tube itself loses weight when any portion
of it is kept red-hot for some little time; and, therefore, unless the
crust is required in the original tube, it is better to divide it, carefully
weigh the arsenical portion, remove the crust, and then re-weigh. The
method is not perfectly accurate. The mirror is not pure metallic
arsenic (see <a href="#Page_571">p. 571</a>), and if the white alkaline residue be examined,
arsenic will be detected in it, the reason being that the arsenical
sulphide generally contains pentasulphide of arsenic as well as free
sulphur. Now the pentasulphide does not give up metallic arsenic when
treated as before detailed; nor, indeed, does the trisulphide, if mixed
with much sulphur, yield an arsenical crust. It is, therefore, of great
moment to free the precipitate as much as possible from sulphur, before
attempting the reduction.</p>

<p>The development of a reducing gas from a special and somewhat complicated
apparatus is not absolutely necessary. The whole process of
reduction, from beginning to end, may take place in a single tube by any
of the following processes:&mdash;(1) The sulphide is mixed with oxalate of
soda (a salt which contains no water of crystallisation), and the dry mixture
is transferred to a suitable tube, sealed at one end. An arsenical mirror
is readily obtained, and, if the heat is continued long enough, no arsenic
remains behind&mdash;an excellent and easy method, in which the reducing
gas is carbonic oxide, in an atmosphere of carbonic anhydride. (2) The
sulphide is oxidised by <i>aqua regia</i>, and the solution evaporated to complete
dryness. The residue is then dissolved in a few drops of water,
with the addition of some largish grains of good wood charcoal (which
absorb most of the solution), and the whole carefully dried. The mass
is now transferred to a tube closed at one end, a little charcoal added in
the form of an upper layer, and heat applied first to this upper layer, so
as to replace the air with <span class="chemform">CO<sub>2</sub></span>, and then to bring the whole tube gradually
to redness from above downwards. In this case also the whole of
the arsenic sublimes as a metallic mirror.</p>

<p>There are various other modifications, but the above are trustworthy,
and quite sufficient. Brugelmann&#8217;s method of determining arsenic, elsewhere
described, would appear to possess some advantages, and to promise
well; but the writer has had no personal experience of it with regard
to arsenic.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_747" id="Sect_747"></a>&sect; 747. <b>Conversion of Arsenic into Arsenious Chloride</b> (<span class="chemform">AsCl<sub>3</sub></span>).&mdash;This
process, first employed by Schneider and Fyfe, and afterwards
modified by Taylor, differs from all the preceding, since an attempt is
made to separate by one operation volatile metallic chlorides, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span>
destroy the organic matter, and thus obtain two liquids&mdash;one a distillate&mdash;tolerably
clear and free from solid particles, whilst the mass in the
retort retains such metals as copper, and is in every way easy to deal
with.</p>

<p>Schneider and Fyfe employed sulphuric acid and common salt; but
Taylor recommends hydrochloric acid, which is in every respect preferable.
As recommended by Taylor, all matters, organic or otherwise, are
to be completely desiccated before their introduction into a retort, and on
these dried substances sufficient pure hydrochloric acid poured, and the
distillation pushed to dryness. Every one is well aware how tedious is
the attempt to dry perfectly the organs of the body (such as liver, &amp;c.)
at any temperature low enough to ensure against volatilisation of such a
substance as, <i>e.g.</i>, calomel. This drying has, therefore, been the great
stumbling-block which has prevented the general application of the
process. It will be found, however, that drying in the ordinary way is
by no means necessary. The writer cuts up the solid organ (such as
liver, brain, &amp;c.) with scissors into small pieces, and transfers them to a
retort fitted by an air-tight joint to a Liebig condenser; the condenser in
its turn being connected with a flask by a tube passing through an india-rubber
stopper dipping into a little water. Another tube from the same
flask is connected with india-rubber piping, which is connected with a
water-pump, the fall tube of which terminates in the basement of a
house over a gully. The distillation is now carried on to carbonisation;
on cooling, a second quantity of hydrochloric acid is added, and the last
fraction of the distillate examined for arsenic. If any is found, a third
distillation is necessary. At the termination of the operation the retort
is washed with water, the solution filtered, and this solution and the distillate
are each separately examined for arsenic. If properly performed,
however, the second distillation brings over the whole of the arsenical
chloride,<a name="FNanchor_794" id="FNanchor_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> and none will be found in the retort. With the above arrangement
there can be no odour, nor is there any loss of substance. In the
distillate the arsenic can hardly be in the form of arsenious chloride, but
rather arsenious acid and hydrochloric acid; for the chloride easily splits
up in the presence of water into these substances. It is best to convert
it into the trisulphide. Taylor<a name="FNanchor_795" id="FNanchor_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> recommends evolving arsine in the
usual way, and passing the arsine (<span class="chemform">AsH<sub>3</sub></span>) into solution of silver nitrate,
finally estimating it as an arseniate of silver. Objections with regard
to the impurity of reagents should be met by blank experiments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[577]</a></span>
Kaiser<a name="FNanchor_796" id="FNanchor_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> has proposed and practised a modification of this method, which
essentially consists in the use of sulphuric acid and sodic chloride (as in
Schneider and Fyfe&#8217;s original process), and in passing the distillate first
into a flask containing a crystal or two of potassium chlorate, and thence
into an absorption bulb; in the latter most of the arsenic is found in the
form of arsenic acid, the chloride having been oxidised in its passage.
The apparatus is, however, complicated in this way without a corresponding
advantage.<a name="FNanchor_797" id="FNanchor_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> Lastly, E. Fischer<a name="FNanchor_798" id="FNanchor_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> has shown that it is a considerable
advantage to add from 10 to 20 c.c. of a saturated solution of
ferrous chloride before distilling with <span class="chemform">HCl</span>. In this way all the arsenic,
whether as arsenic or arsenious acids, is easily converted into chloride.</p>

a black powder thrown down from solutions; as a film deposited on
copper or platinum; and, lastly, as a ring on the inside of a tube from
the decomposition of stibine. At a bright red-heat it is volatilised
slowly, even when hydrogen is passed over it; chlorine, bromine, and
iodine combine with it directly. It may be boiled in concentrated <span class="chemform">ClH</span>

<p><a name="Sect_749" id="Sect_749"></a>&sect; 749. <b>Antimonious Sulphide.</b>&mdash;Sulphide of antimony = 336; composition
in 100 parts, Sb 71&middot;76, S 28&middot;24. The commercial article, known
under the name of black antimony, is the native sulphide, freed from
silicious matter by fusion, and afterwards pulverised. It is a crystalline
metallic-looking powder, of a steel-grey colour, and is often much contaminated
with iron, lead, copper, and arsenic.</p>

<p>The amorphous sulphide (as obtained by saturating a solution of tartar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span>
emetic with <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>) is an orange-red powder, soluble in potash and in
ammonic, sodic, and potassic sulphides; and dissolving also in concentrated
hydrochloric acid with evolution of <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>. It is insoluble in water
and dilute acid, scarcely dissolves in carbonate of ammonia, and is quite
insoluble in potassic bisulphite. If ignited gently in a stream of carbonic
acid gas, the weight remains constant. To render it anhydrous, a heat
of 200&deg; is required.</p>

<p>The recognition of arsenic in the commercial sulphide is most easily
effected by placing 2 grms. or more in a suitable retort (with condenser),
adding hydrochloric acid, and distilling. The chloride of arsenic passes
over before the chloride of antimony; and by not raising the heat too
high, very little antimony will come over, even if the distillation be
carried almost to dryness. The arsenic is detected in the distillate by the
ordinary methods.</p>

<p>Several lamentable accidents have happened through mistaking the
sulphide of antimony for oxide of manganese, and using it with potassic
chlorate for the production of oxygen. The addition of a drop of
hydrochloric acid, it is scarcely necessary to say, will distinguish between
the two.</p>

<p>Antimony is frequently estimated as sulphide. An amorphous tersulphide
of mercury, containing a small admixture of antimonious oxide and
sulphide of potassium, is known under the name of <i>Kermes mineral</i>, and
has lately been employed in the vulcanising of india-rubber. Prepared
in this way, the latter may be used for various purposes, and thus become
a source of danger. It behoves the analyst, therefore, in searching for
antimony, to take special care not to use any india-rubber fittings which
might contain the preparation.</p>

<p>A <i>pentasulphide of antimony</i> (from the decomposition of Schleppe&#8217;s
salt [<span class="chemform">Na<sub>3</sub>Sb<sub>6</sub>S<sub>4</sub></span> + <span class="chemform">9H<sub>2</sub>O</span>], when heated with an acid) is used in calico-printing.</p>

theoretically, should contain 35&middot;2 per cent. of metallic antimony. The B.P.
gives a method of estimation of tartar emetic not free from error, and Professor
Dunstan has proposed the following:&mdash;Dissolve 0&middot;3 grm. of tartar
emetic in 80 c.c. of water, add to this 10 c.c. of a 5 per cent. solution of
sodium bicarbonate, and immediately titrate with a decinormal solution of

tartar emetic; therefore, if pure, the quantity used by 0&middot;3 grm. should
be 18 c.c. Tartar emetic occurs in commerce in colourless, transparent,
rhombic, octahedral crystals, slightly efflorescing in dry air.</p>

chars at a still higher temperature, 287&middot;7&deg; (550&deg; F.). On evaporating a
few drops of a solution of tartar emetic, and examining the residue by
the microscope, the crystals are either tetrahedra, cubes, or branched
figures. 100 parts of cold water dissolve 5 of tartar emetic, whilst the
same quantity of boiling water dissolves ten times as much, viz., 50.

doses of tartar emetic act on the warm-blooded animals as on

all animals able to vomit<a name="FNanchor_805" id="FNanchor_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> do so. The heart&#8217;s action, at first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[583]</a></span>
quickened, is afterwards slowed, weakened, and lastly paralysed. This
action is noticed in cold as well as in warm-blooded animals. It is to be
ascribed to a direct action on the heart; for if the brain and spinal cord
of the frog be destroyed&mdash;or even if a solution of the salt be applied
direct to the frog&#8217;s heart separated from the body&mdash;the effect is the same.
The weak action of the heart, of course, causes the blood-pressure to
diminish, and the heart stops in diastole. The voluntary muscles of the
body are also weakened; the breathing is affected, partly from the
action on the muscles. The temperature of the body is depressed
(according to F. A. Falck&#8217;s researches) from 4&middot;4&deg; to 6&middot;2&deg;.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_805" id="Footnote_805"></a><a href="#FNanchor_805"><span class="label">[805]</span></a> L. Hermann (<i>Lehrbuch der experimentellen Toxicologie</i>) remarks that
the vomiting must be considered as a reflex action from the inflammatory
excitement of the digestive apparatus, especially of the stomach. It is
witnessed if the poison is administered subcutaneously or injected into
the brain. Indeed, it is established that (at least, so far as the
muscles are concerned) the co-ordinated movements producing vomiting are
caused by excitement of the medulla oblongata. Giannussi and others
found that after section between the first and third vertebr&aelig; of dogs,
and subsequent administration of tartar emetic, no vomiting took place;
and Grimm&#8217;s researches seem to show that the suspected <i>vomit-centre</i> is
identical with the respiratory centre, so that the vomiting movement is
only an abnormal respiratory movement. L. Hermann, however, considers
the theory that when tartar emetic is introduced into the vessels the
<i>vomit-centre</i> is directly excited, erroneous, for (1) in introducing it
by the veins much larger doses are required to excite vomiting than by
the stomach; and (2), after subcutaneous injection of the salt, antimony
is found in the first vomit. His explanation, therefore, is that
antimony is excreted by the intestinal tract, and in its passage excites
this action. Majendie&#8217;s well-known experiment&mdash;demonstrating that, after
extirpation of the stomach, vomiting movements were noticed&mdash;is not
considered opposed to this view.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>The effect of small doses given repeatedly to animals has been several
times investigated. Dr. Nevin<a name="FNanchor_806" id="FNanchor_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> experimented upon eleven rabbits,
giving them tartar emetic four times a day in doses of 32&middot;4 mgrms.
(<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> grain), 64&middot;8 mgrms. (1 grain), and 129&middot;6 mgrms. (2 grains). Five
died, the first after four, the last after seventeen days; three were killed
after one, three, and four days respectively, two after an interval of fourteen
days, and one thirty-one days after taking the last dose. There was
no vomiting; diarrh&#339;a was present in about half the number; one of
the rabbits, being with young, aborted. The chief symptoms were
general dulness, loss of appetite, and in a few days great emaciation.
Four of the five that died were convulsed before death, and several of
the animals exhibited ulcers of the mucous membrane of the mouth, in
places with which the powder had come in contact. Caillol and Livon
have also studied the action of small doses of the white oxide of antimony
given in milk to cats. A cat took in this way in 109 days
&middot;628 grm. The animal passed gradually into a cachectic state, diarrh&#339;a
supervened, and it died miserably thin and exhausted.</p>

the symptoms produced by arsenic and antimony is striking, and in
some acute cases of poisoning by tartar emetic, there is but little (if any)
clinical difference. If the dose of tartar emetic is very large, there may
be complete absence of vomiting, or only a single evacuation of the
stomach. Thus, in a case mentioned by Taylor, in which a veterinary
surgeon swallowed by mistake 13 grms. (200 grains) of tartar emetic,
vomiting after fifteen minutes could only be induced by tickling the
throat. So, again, in the case reported by Mr. Freer, a man, aged 28,
took 7&middot;77 grms. (120 grains) of tartar emetic by mistake for Epsom salts;
he vomited only once; half an hour after taking the poison he had
violent pain in the stomach and abdomen, and spasmodic contraction of
the abdomen and arms; the fingers were firmly contracted, the muscles
quite rigid, and there was involuntary aqueous purging. After six hours,
during which he was treated with green tea, brandy, and decoction of
oak-bark, he began to recover, but suffered for many nights from profuse
perspirations.</p>

caused well-marked symptoms of poisoning in the case of a servant and

<p>With more moderate and yet large doses, nausea and vomiting are
very prominent symptoms, and are seldom delayed more than half an
hour. The regular course of symptoms may therefore be summed up
thus:&mdash;A metallic taste in the mouth, repeated vomitings, which are
sometimes bloody, great faintness and depression, pains in the abdomen
and stomach, and diarrh&#339;a, which may be involuntary. If the case is
to terminate fatally, the urine is suppressed, the temperature falls, the
face becomes cyanotic, delirium and convulsions supervene, and death
occurs in from two to six days. Antimony, like arsenic, often produces
a pustular eruption. Solitary cases deviate more or less from the course
described, <i>i.e.</i>, severe cramps affecting all the muscles, h&aelig;morrhage from
the stomach, kidney, or bowel, and death from collapse in a few hours,
have all been noticed. In a case recorded by Mr. Morley,<a name="FNanchor_808" id="FNanchor_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> a surgeon&#8217;s
daughter, aged 18, took by mistake an unknown quantity of antimonial
wine; she soon felt sleepy and powerless, and suffered from the usual
symptoms in combination with tetanic spasms of the legs. She afterwards
had enteritis for three weeks, and on recovery her hair fell off.
Orfila relates a curious case of intense spasm of the gullet from a large
dose of tartar emetic.</p>

In the case of Mrs. Pritchard,<a name="FNanchor_809" id="FNanchor_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> her face was flushed, and her manner so

<p><a name="Sect_759" id="Sect_759"></a>&sect; 759. <b>Post-mortem Appearances.</b>&mdash;The effect of large doses of tartar
emetic is mainly concentrated upon the gastro-intestinal mucous membrane.
There is an example in the museum of University College
Hospital of the changes which resulted from the administration of tartar
emetic in the treatment of pneumonia. These are ascribed in the catalogue,
in part to the local action of the medicine, and in part to the
extreme prostration of the patient. In the preparation (No. 1052) the
mucous membrane over the fore border of the epiglottis and adjacent
part of the pharynx has been destroyed by sloughing; the ulceration
extends into the upper part of the &#339;sophagus. About an inch below its
commencement, the mucous membrane has been entirely removed by
sloughing and ulceration, the circular muscular fibres being exposed.
Above the upper limit of this ulcer, the mucous membrane presents
several oval, elongated, and ulcerated areas, occupied by strips of mucous
membrane which have sloughed. In other places, irregular portions of
the mucous membrane, of a dull ashen-gray colour, have undergone
sloughing; the edges of the sloughing portion are of colours varying
from brown to black.</p>

<p>It is seldom that so much change is seen in the gullet and pharynx as
this museum preparation exhibits; but redness, swelling, and the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[586]</a></span>
signs of inflammation are seldom absent from the stomach and some
parts of the intestines. On the lining membrane of the mouth, ulcers
and pustules have been observed.</p>

<p>In Dr. Nevin&#8217;s experiments on the chronic poisoning of rabbits already
referred to, the <i>post-mortem</i> appearances consisted in congestion of the
liver in all the rabbits; in nearly all there was vivid redness of the stomach;
in two cases there was ulceration; in some, cartilaginous hardness of the
pylorus; while, in others, the small intestines presented patches of
inflammation. In two of the rabbits the solitary glands throughout the
intestines were prominent, yellow in colour, and loaded with antimony.
The colon and rectum were healthy, the kidneys congested; the lungs
were in most congested, in some actually inflamed, or hepatised and
gorged with blood. Bloody extravasations in the chest and abdomen
were frequent.</p>

<p>Saikowsky,<a name="FNanchor_811" id="FNanchor_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> in feeding animals daily with antimony, found invariably
in the course of fourteen to nineteen days fatty degeneration of the liver,
and sometimes of the kidney and heart. In the experiment of Caillol
and Livon also all the organs were pale, the liver had undergone fatty
degeneration, and the lung had its alveoli filled with large degenerated
cells, consisting almost entirely of fat. The mesenteric glands also formed
large caseous masses, yellowish-white in colour, which, under the microscope,
were seen to be composed of fatty cells, so that there is a complete
analogy between the action of arsenic and antimony on the body tissues.</p>

by the urine. In 1840, Orfila showed to the <i>Acad&eacute;mie de M&eacute;decine</i>
metallic antimony, which he had extracted from a patient who had taken
&middot;12 grm. of tartar emetic in twenty-four hours. He also obtained antimony
from an old woman, aged 80, who twelve hours before had taken
&middot;6 grm. (9<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> grains)&mdash;a large dose, which had neither produced vomiting
nor purging. In Dr. Kevin&#8217;s experiments on rabbits, antimony was
discovered in the urine after the twelfth dose, and even in the urine of
an animal twenty-one days after the administration of the poison had
been suspended.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_761" id="Sect_761"></a>&sect; 761. <b>Antidotes for Tartar Emetic.</b>&mdash;Any infusion containing
tannin or allied astringent principles, such as decoctions of tea, oak-bark,
&amp;c., may be given with advantage in cases of recent poisoning by tartar
emetic, for any of the salt which has been expelled by vomiting may in
this way be decomposed and rendered harmless. The treatment of acute
poisoning which has proved most successful, has been the encouraging of
vomiting by tickling the fauces, giving strong green tea and stimulants.

<p><a name="Sect_762" id="Sect_762"></a>&sect; 762. <b>Effects of Chloride or Butter of Antimony.</b>&mdash;Only a few
cases of poisoning by butter of antimony are on record: its action,
generally speaking, on the tissues is like that of an acid, but there has
been considerable variety in the symptoms. Five cases are recorded by
Taylor; three of the number recovered after taking respectively doses of
7&middot;7 grms. (2 drachms) and 15&middot;5 grms. (4 drachms), and two died after
taking from 56&middot;6 to 113 grms. (2 to 4 ounces). In one of these cases
the symptoms were more like those of a narcotic poison, in the other
fatal case there was abundant vomiting with purging. The autopsy
in the first case showed a black appearance from the mouth to the
jejunum, as if the parts had been charred, and extensive destruction of
the mucous membrane. In the other case there were similar changes in
the stomach and the upper part of the intestines, but neither the lips
nor the lower end of the gullet were eroded. In a case recorded by
Mr. Barrington Cooke,<a name="FNanchor_812" id="FNanchor_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> a farmer&#8217;s wife, aged 40, of unsound mind,
managed to elude the watchfulness of her friends, and swallowed an
unknown quantity of antimony chloride about 1.30 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span> Shortly afterwards
she vomited several times, and had diarrh&#339;a; at 2.30 a medical
man found her lying on her back insensible, and very livid in the face
and neck. She was retching, and emitting from her mouth a frothy
mucous fluid, mixed with ejected matter of a grumous colour; the
breathing was laboured and spasmodic; the pulse could not be felt, and
the body was cold and clammy. She expired at 3.30, about one hour
and a half from the commencement of symptoms, and probably within
two hours from the taking of the poison. The autopsy showed no corrugation
of the tongue or inner surface of the lining membrane of the
mouth, and no appearance of the action of a corrosive upon the lips,
fauces, or mucous membrane of the &#339;sophagus. The whole of the
mucous membrane of the stomach was intensely congested, of a dark and
almost black colour, the rest of the viscera were healthy. Chemical
analysis separated antimony equivalent to nearly a grm. (15 grains) of
the chloride, with a small quantity of arsenic, from the contents of the
stomach.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_763" id="Sect_763"></a>&sect; 763. <b>Detection of Antimony in Organic Matters.</b>&mdash;In acute poisoning
by tartar emetic it is not impossible to find a mere trace only in the
stomach, the greater part having been expelled by vomiting, which nearly
always occurs early, so that the most certain method is, where possible, to
analyse the ejected matters. If it should be suspected that a living
person is being slowly poisoned by antimony, it must be remembered
that the poison is mainly excreted by the kidneys, and the urine should
afford some indication. The readiest way to test is to collect a considerable
quantity of the urine (if necessary, two or three days&#8217; excretion),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[588]</a></span>
concentrate by evaporation, acidify, and then transfer the liquid to a
platinum dish, in which is placed a slip of zinc. The whole of the antimony
is in time deposited on the platinum dish, and being thus concentrated,
may be subsequently identified in any way thought fit.</p>

<p>Organic liquids are boiled with hydrochloric acid; organic solids are
extracted with the same acid in the manner described (<a href="#Page_51">p. 51</a>); or, if the
distillation process given at <a href="#Page_576">p. 576</a> be employed, the antimony may be
found partly in the distillate, and partly in the retort. In any case, antimony
in solution may be readily detected in a variety of ways&mdash;one of
the most convenient being to concentrate on tin or platinum, to dissolve
out the antimonial film by sulphide of ammonium, and thus produce the
very characteristic orange sulphide.</p>

<p>If a slip of pure tinfoil be suspended for six hours in a solution,
which should not contain more than one-tenth of its bulk of <span class="chemform">ClH</span>, and
exhibit no stain or deposit, it is certain that antimony cannot be present.
It may also conveniently be deposited on a platinum dish,<a name="FNanchor_813" id="FNanchor_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> by filling
the same with the liquid properly acidulated, and inserting a rod of zinc;
the metallic antimony can afterwards be washed, dried, and weighed.</p>

<p>Reinsch&#8217;s and Marsh&#8217;s tests have been already described (<a href="#Page_558">pp. 558</a> and
<a href="#Page_559">559</a>), and require no further notice. There is, however, a very beautiful
and delicate means of detecting antimony, which should not be omitted.
It is based upon the action of stibine (<span class="chemform">SbH<sub>3</sub></span>) on sulphur.<a name="FNanchor_814" id="FNanchor_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a> When this
gas is passed over sulphur, it is decomposed according to equation,
<span class="chemform">2SbH<sub>3</sub></span> + <span class="chemform">6S</span> = <span class="chemform">Sb<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub></span> + <span class="chemform">3SH<sub>2</sub></span>, the action taking place slowly in diffused
daylight, but very rapidly in sunshine. An ordinary flask for the evolution
of hydrogen (either by galvanic processes or from zinc and sulphuric
acid), with its funnel and drying-tubes, is connected with a narrow tube
having a few fragments of sulphur, kept in place by plugs of cotton wool.
The whole apparatus is placed in sunshine; if no orange colour is produced
when the hydrogen has been passing for some time, the liquid to
be tested is poured in gradually through the funnel, and if antimony
should be present, the sulphur acquires a deep orange colour. This is
distinct even when so small a quantity as &middot;0001 grain has been added
through the funnel. The sulphide of antimony thus mixed with sulphur
can, if it is thought necessary, be freed from the sulphur by repeated
exhaustion with bisulphide of carbon. The stibine does not, however,
represent all the antimony introduced, a very large proportion remaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[589]</a></span>
in the evolution flask;<a name="FNanchor_815" id="FNanchor_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> hence it cannot be employed for quantitative
purposes. Moreover, the test can, of course, only be conveniently applied
on sunny days, and is, therefore, in England more adapted for summer.<a name="FNanchor_816" id="FNanchor_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a>
Often, however, as mentioned elsewhere, when the analyst has no clue
whatever to the nature of the poison, it is convenient to pass <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span> in the
liquid to saturation.<a name="FNanchor_817" id="FNanchor_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> In such a case, if antimony is present (either
alone or in combination with other sulphides), it remains on the filter,
and must be separated and identified as follows:&mdash;The sulphides are
first treated with a solution of carbonate of ammonia, which will dissolve
arsenic, if present, and next saturated <i>in situ</i> with pure sulphide of
sodium, which will dissolve out sulphide of antimony, if present. The
sulphide of antimony will present the chemical characters already

giving off violet vapour. In solution, the salt gives the reactions of iodine and
cadmium. The ointment of iodide of cadmium (<i>Unguentum cadmii iodidi</i>) contains
the iodide in the proportion of 62 grains to the ounce, or 14 per cent.</p>

<p><b>Cadmium Sulphate</b> is officinal in the Belgian, Portuguese, and French pharmacop&#339;ias.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_769" id="Sect_769"></a>&sect; 769. <b>Cadmium in the Arts, &amp;c.</b>&mdash;Cadmium is used in various alloys. The

his experiments on it with animals, observed giddiness, vomiting, syncope, difficulty
in respiration, loss of consciousness, and cramps. The amount necessary to destroy
life can only be gathered from the experiments on animals. A strong hound died
after the injection of &middot;03 grm. (&middot;462 grain) subcutaneously of a salt of cadmium;
rabbits are poisoned if from 19&middot;4 to 38&middot;8 mgrms. (&middot;3 to &middot;6 grain) are introduced into
the stomach. A watery solution of &middot;5 grm. (7&middot;5 grains) of the bromide administered

killed a second pigeon in six minutes; &middot;25 grm. (3&middot;85 grains) of sulphite of cadmium
administered to a pigeon excited vomiting, and after two hours diarrh&#339;a; it died
in eight days. Another pigeon died from a similar dose in fourteen days, and
cadmium, on analysis, was separated from the liver. From the above cases it would
seem probable that 4 grms. (61&middot;7 grains) would be a <i>dangerous</i> dose of a soluble salt
of cadmium for an adult, and that in a case of chronic poisoning it would most
probably be found in the liver.</p>

<p>Lead-poisoning, either in its obscure form (producing uric acid in the
blood, and, as a consequence, indigestion and other evils), or in the acute
form (as lead colic and various nervous affections), is most frequent
among those who are habitually exposed to the influence of the metal in
its different preparations, viz., workers of lead, house-painters, artists,
gilders, workers of arsenic, workers of gold, calico-printers, colourists,
type-founders, type-setters, shot-founders, potters, faience makers, braziers,
and many others.<a name="FNanchor_825" id="FNanchor_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> In white-lead factories so large a number of the
employ&eacute;s suffer from poisoning that it has excited more than once the
attention of the Government.<a name="FNanchor_826" id="FNanchor_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_825" id="Footnote_825"></a><a href="#FNanchor_825"><span class="label">[825]</span></a> The attention which the use of lead in the arts has always excited
is evident from the fact that one of the oldest works on Trade Hygiene
(by Stockhausen) is entitled, <i>De lithargyrii fumo noxio, morbifico
ejusque metallico frequentiori morbo vulgo dicto h&uuml;ttenkatze</i>, Gaslar,
1556.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_826" id="Footnote_826"></a><a href="#FNanchor_826"><span class="label">[826]</span></a> A departmental committee, appointed to inquire into the white lead
and allied industries, in a report presented to the Home Secretary
stated:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;8. (<i>a</i>) It is known that if lead (in any form), even in what may be
called infinitesimal quantities, gains entrance into the system for a
lengthened period, by such channels as the stomach, by swallowing lead
dust in the saliva, or through the medium of food and drink; by the
respiratory organs, as by the inhalation of dust; or through the skin;
there is developed a series of symptoms, the most frequent of which is
colic. Nearly all the individuals engaged in factories where lead or its
compounds are manipulated look pale, and it is this bloodlessness and
the presence of a blue line along the margin of the gums, close to the
teeth, that herald the other symptoms of plumbism. (<i>b</i>) A form of
paralysis known as wrist-drop or lead-palsy occasionally affects the
hands of the operatives. There is, in addition, a form of acute
lead-poisoning, most frequently met with in young girls from 18 to 24
years of age, which is suddenly developed and is extremely fatal. In it
the first complaint is headache, followed sooner or later by convulsions
and unconsciousness. Death often terminates such a case within three
days. In some cases of recovery from convulsions total blindness
remains.</p>

<p>&#8220;9. There has been considerable doubt as to the channels by which the
poison enters the system. The committee have taken much evidence on this
subject, and have arrived at the conclusion (<i>a</i>) that carbonate of lead
may be absorbed through the pores of the skin, and that the chance of
this is much increased during perspiration and where there is any
friction between the skin and the clothing; (<i>b</i>) that minute portions
of lead are carried by the hands, under and round the nails, &amp;c., on to
the food, and so into the stomach; (<i>c</i>) but that the most usual manner
is by the inhalation of lead dust. Some of this becomes dissolved in the
alkaline secretions of the mouth, and is swallowed by the saliva, thus
finding its way to the stomach. Other particles of dust are carried to
the lungs, where they are rendered soluble and absorbed by the
blood.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Report of Chief Inspector of Factories for 1893.</i></p>

<p>Lead, again, has been found by the analyst in most of the ordinary
foods, such as flour, bread, beer, cider, wines, spirits, tea, vinegar, sugar,
confectionery, &amp;c., as well as in numerous drugs, especially those manufactured
by the aid of sulphuric acid (the latter nearly always containing
lead), and those salts or chemical products which (like citric and tartaric
acids) are crystallised in leaden pans. Hence it follows that in almost
everything eaten or drunk the analyst, as a matter of routine, tests for lead.
The channels through which it may enter into the system are, however,
so perfectly familiar to practical chemists, that a few <i>unusual</i> instances of
lead-poisoning only need be quoted here.</p>

<p>A cabman suffered from lead colic, traced to his taking the first glass
of beer every morning at a certain public-house; the beer standing in the

<p><a name="Sect_780" id="Sect_780"></a>&sect; 780. <b>Effects of Lead Compounds on Animals.</b>&mdash;Orfila and the
older school of toxicologists made a number of experiments on the action
of sugar of lead and other compounds, but they are of little value for
elucidating the physiological or toxic action of lead, because they were, for
the most part, made under unnatural conditions, the gullet being ligatured
to avoid expulsion of the salt by vomiting. Harnack, in order to avoid
the local and corrosive effects of sugar of lead, used an organic compound,
viz., plumbic triethyl acetate, which has no local action. Frogs exhibited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[597]</a></span>
symptoms after subcutaneous doses of from 2 to 3 mgrms., rabbits after
40 mgrms.; there was increased peristaltic action of the intestines, with
spasmodic contraction rising to colic, very often diarrh&#339;a, and death
followed through heart paralysis. Dogs given the ethyl compound
exhibited nervous symptoms like chorea. Gusserno<a name="FNanchor_835" id="FNanchor_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a> has also made
experiments on animals as to the effects of lead, using lead phosphate,
and giving from 1&middot;2 grm. to a rabbit and a dog daily. Rosenstein<a name="FNanchor_836" id="FNanchor_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a> and
Heubel<a name="FNanchor_837" id="FNanchor_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a> used small doses of acetate, the latter giving dogs daily from &middot;2
to &middot;5 grm. The results arrived at by Gusserno were, mainly, that the
animals became emaciated, shivered, and had some paralysis of the hinder
extremities; while Rosenstein observed towards the end epileptiform
convulsions, and Heubel alone saw, in a few of his cases, colic. A considerable
number of cattle have been poisoned from time to time with
lead, and one instance of this fell under my own observation. A pasture
had been manured with refuse from a plumber&#8217;s yard, and pieces of paint
were in this way strewn about the field in every direction; a herd of
fifteen young cattle were placed in the field, and in two or three days
they all, without exception, began rapidly to lose condition, and to show
peculiar symptoms&mdash;diarrh&#339;a, loss of appetite; in two, blindness, the
retina presenting an appearance not unlike that seen in Bright&#8217;s disease;
in three, a sort of delirium. Four died, and showed on <i>post-mortem</i>
examination granular conditions of the kidneys, which was the most
striking change observable. In the fatal cases, paralysis of the hind
extremities, coma, and convulsions preceded death. In another case<a name="FNanchor_838" id="FNanchor_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a>
seven cows and a bull died from eating lead paint; the symptoms were
loss of appetite, obstinate constipation, suspension of rumination, dry
muffle, quick breathing, and coma. In other cases a marked symptom
has been paralysis. Cattle<a name="FNanchor_839" id="FNanchor_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> have also several times been poisoned from
eating grass which has been splashed by the spray from bullets, as in
pastures in the vicinity of rifle butts; here we must allow that the intestinal
juices have dissolved the metal, and transformed it into compounds
capable of being taken into the system.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_781" id="Sect_781"></a>&sect; 781. <b>Effects of Lead Compounds on Man&mdash;Acute Poisoning.</b>&mdash;Acute
poisoning by preparations of lead is not common, and, when it
does occur, is seldom fatal. With regard to the common acetate, it
would seem that a large single dose is less likely to destroy life than
smaller quantities given in divided doses for a considerable period. The
symptoms produced by a considerable dose of sugar of lead usually commence
within a few minutes; there is immediately a metallic taste, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[598]</a></span>
burning, and a sensation of great dryness in the mouth and throat;
vomiting, which occurs usually within fifteen minutes, is in very rare
cases delayed from one to two hours. The retching and vomiting are
very obstinate, and continue for a long time; the matters thrown up are
sometimes streaked with blood; there is pain in the abdomen of a colicky
character&mdash;a pain relieved by pressure. The bowels are, as a rule, constipated,
but occasionally relaxed. The stools at a later date are black
from the presence of lead sulphide. The urine, as a rule, is diminished.
The breath has a foul odour, and the tongue is coated; the skin is dry,
and the pulse small and frequent. The full development of the toxic
action is completed by the appearance of various nervous phenomena&mdash;headache,
shooting pains in the limbs, cramps in the legs, and local
numbness. All the symptoms enumerated are not present in each case;
the most constant are the vomiting and the colic. If the sufferer is to
die, death occurs about the second or third day. If the patient recovers,
convalescence may be much retarded, as shown in the case of two girls,<a name="FNanchor_840" id="FNanchor_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a>
who had each swallowed an ounce of lead acetate by mistake, and who
suffered even after the lapse of a year from pain and tenderness in the
stomach and sickness.</p>

<p>There are &#8220;mass-poisonings&#8221; by acetate of lead on record, which afford
considerable insight into the varying action of this salt on different individuals.
A case (<i>e.g.</i>) occurred at Stourbridge in 1840,<a name="FNanchor_841" id="FNanchor_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a> in which no
less than 500 people were poisoned by thirty pounds of lead acetate being
accidentally mixed with eighty sacks of flour at a miller&#8217;s. The symptoms
commenced after a few days; constriction of the throat, cramping and
twisting pains round the umbilicus, rigidity of the abdominal muscles,
dragging pains at the loins, cramps and paralysis of the lower extremities.
There was obstinate constipation; the urine was scanty and of a deep red
colour, and the secretions were generally arrested; the pulse was slow
and feeble; the countenance depressed, often livid; and the gums showed
the usual blue line. The temperature of the skin was low. In only a
few cases was there sickness, and in these it soon ceased. It is curious
that not one of the 500 cases proved fatal, although some of the victims
were extremely ill, and their condition alarming. It was specially
observed that, after apparent convalescence, the symptoms, without any
obvious cause, suddenly returned, and this even in a more aggravated
form. Remittance of this kind is of medico-legal import; it might, for
example, be wrongly inferred that a fresh dose had been taken. In the
500 cases there were no inflammatory symptoms; complete recovery took
some time. On examining the bread the poison was found so unequally
distributed that no idea could be formed as to the actual amount taken.</p>

of the 7th Infantry at Tione, in the Southern Tyrol. One case proved
fatal, forty-five required treatment in hospital. The symptoms were
pallor, a blue line in the gums, metallic taste in the mouth, a peculiar
odour of the breath, a loaded tongue with a bluish tint, obstinate constipation
with loss of appetite whilst all complained, in addition, of
dragging of the limbs and of the muscles of the chest, and difficulty of
breathing. In the severer cases there were tetanic spasms, muscular
tremors, and an&aelig;sthesia of the fingers and toes. The pulse and temperature
were normal, save in a few cases in which there were fever and
sweats at night. <i>In none was there colic</i>, but the constipation was
obstinate. In two of the worst cases there was strangury. Acute cases
occur occasionally from poisoning by <i>the carbonate of lead</i>. Dr. Snow
recorded an instance (in 1844) of a child who had eaten a piece as big
as a marble, ground up with oil. For three days the child suffered from
pain in the abdomen and vomiting, and died ninety hours after taking
the poison. In another case, in which a young man took from 19 to 20
grms. of lead carbonate in mistake for chalk as a remedy for heartburn,
the symptoms of vomiting, pain in the stomach, &amp;c., commenced after a
few hours; but, under treatment with magnesic sulphate, he recovered.</p>

the digestion is disturbed, the appetite lessened, the bowels obstinately
confined, the skin assumes a peculiar yellowish hue, and sometimes the

<p>In 142 cases of lead-poisoning, treated between 1852 and 1862 at the
Jacob&#8217;s Hospital, Leipzig, forty-four patients (or about 31 per cent.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[600]</a></span>
suffered from colic. Arthralgia&mdash;that is, pains in the joints&mdash;is also
very common; it seldom occurs alone, but in combination with other
symptoms. Thus, in seventy-five cases of lead-arthralgia treated at
Jacob&#8217;s Hospital, in only seven were pain in the joints without other
complications, fifty-six being accompanied by colic, five by paralysis, and
seven by other affections of the nervous system. The total percentage
of cases of lead-poisoning, in which arthralgia occurs, varies from 32 to
57 per cent.</p>

<p>Paralysis, in some form or other, Tanqueril<a name="FNanchor_844" id="FNanchor_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a> found in 5 to 8 per cent.
of the cases, and noticed that it occurred as early as the third day after
working in lead. The muscles affected are usually those of the upper
extremity, then the legs, and still more rarely the muscles of the trunk.
It is only exceptionally that the paralysis extends over an entire limb;
it more usually affects a muscular group, or even a single muscle. Its
common seat is the extensors of the hand and fingers; hence the expression
&#8220;dropped-wrist,&#8221; for the hands droop, and occasionally the triceps
and the deltoid are affected. The paralysis is usually symmetrical on both
sides. Although the extensors are affected most, the flexors nearly
always participate, and a careful investigation will show that they are
weakened. If the paralysis continues, there is a wasting and degeneration
of the muscle, but this is seen in paralysis from any cause. The
muscular affection may cause deformities in the hands, shoulders, &amp;c.
An&aelig;sthesia of portions of the skin is generally present in a greater or less
degree. A complete analgesia affecting the whole body has been noticed
to such an extent that there was absolute insensibility to burns or
punctures; but it is usually confined to the right half of the body, and
is especially intense in the right hand and wrist.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_783" id="Sect_783"></a>&sect; 783. The older writers recognised the toxic effect of lead on the
nervous system. Thus Dioscorides speaks of delirium produced by lead,
Aretaeus of epilepsy, and Paul of &AElig;gina refers to it as a factor of
epilepsy and convulsions. But in 1830, Tanqueril first definitely described
the production of a mental disease, which he called &#8220;<i>lead
encephalopathy</i>.&#8221; This he divided into four forms&mdash;(1) a delirious
form; (2) a comatose; (3) a convulsive; and (4) a combined form, comprising
the delirious, convulsive, and comatose. Dr. Henry Rayner,<a name="FNanchor_845" id="FNanchor_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a>
and a few other English alienists, have directed their attention to this
question; and, according to Dr. Rayner&#8217;s researches, the number of male
patients admitted into Hanwell Asylum, engaged in trades such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[601]</a></span>
plumbing, painting, and the like, is larger in proportion to the number
admitted from other trades than it should be, compared with the proportion
of the various trades in the county of Middlesex, as ascertained
from the census. Putting aside coarse lead-poisoning, which may
occasionally produce acute mania, the insanity produced by prolonged
minute lead intoxications possesses some peculiar features. It develops
slowly, and in nearly all cases there are illusions of the senses, of hearing,
taste, or smell, and especially of sight. Thus, in one of Dr. Rayner&#8217;s
cases the patient saw round him &#8220;wind-bags blown out to look like
men,&#8221; apparitions which made remarks to him, and generally worried
him. Besides this form, there is also another which closely resembles
general paralysis, and, in the absence of the history, might be mistaken
for it.</p>

brief exposure to lead, <i>e.g.</i>, a man, thirty-four years of age, after working

<p>Five cases of fatal poisoning occurred between 1884-6 among the
employ&eacute;s of a certain white-lead factory in the east of London. The cases
presented the following common characters. They were all adult
women, aged from 18 to 33, and they had worked at the factory for
short periods, from three to twelve months. They all exhibited mild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[602]</a></span>
symptoms of plumbism, such as a blue line round the gums, and more or
less ill-defined indisposition; paralyses were absent. They were all in
their usual state of health within a few hours or days preceding death.
Death was unexpected, mostly sudden. In four cases it was preceded
by epileptic fits and coma; but in the fifth case no convulsions were
noted, although they may have occurred in the night.</p>

and then treated with ether, hot alcohol, and chloroform until an
albuminoid residue remained; lead was extracted from each of these

<p>The aqueous extract contained 1&middot;5 mgrm. of lead sulphate. In neither
of the cases did the pathologist ascertain the total weight of the brain,
but, presuming that the weight was an average weight, and that the lead
in the remainder of the brain was similarly distributed, the amount of
lead calculated as sulphate would amount to 117 mgrms. From these
results it appears to the author probable that lead forms a substitution
compound with some of the organic brain matters. This view would
explain the absence of changes apparent to the eye found in so many of
the fatal cases of lead encephalopathy.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_786" id="Sect_786"></a>&sect; 786. There are some facts on record which would seem to countenance
the belief that disease, primarily caused by an inorganic body like
lead, may be transmitted. M. Paul (<i>e.g.</i>) has related the history of the
offspring (thirty-two in number) of seven men, who were suffering from
lead-poisoning&mdash;eleven were prematurely born and one still-born; of the
remaining twenty, eight died in the first year, four in the second, and
five in the third year, so that of the whole thirty-two, only three survived
three years.</p>

<p>The influence of the poison on pregnant women is, indeed, very
deleterious. M. Paul noted that in four women who were habitually
exposed to the influence of lead, and had fifteen pregnancies, ten terminated
by abortion, two by premature confinement, three went the full
term, but one of the three children was born dead, a second only lived
twenty-four hours; so that, out of the whole fifteen, one only lived fully.
In another observation of M. Paul&#8217;s, five women had two natural confinements
before being exposed to lead. After exposure, the history of the
thirty-six pregnancies of these women is as follows:&mdash;there were twenty-six
abortions (from two to five months), one premature confinement, two
infants born dead, and five born alive, four of whom died in the first year.</p>

<p>Chronic poisoning may be nearly always accounted for by the inhaling
of lead dust, or by the actual swallowing of some form of lead; but, if we
are to accept the fact narrated by the late Dr. Taylor, viz., that he himself
had an attack of lead colic from sitting in a room for a few hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[604]</a></span>
daily, in which there was a large canvas covered with white lead and
drying oil, and one or two other similar cases,<a name="FNanchor_852" id="FNanchor_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a> we must allow that there
is some subtle volatile organic compound of lead evolved. In the present
state of our knowledge, it seems more reasonable to account for such cases
by the suggestion that lead has entered the system by an unsuspected
channel.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>In 1882, a very interesting case occurred at Keighley, in which a
mechanic, aged 42, died from the supposed effects of lead-poisoning,
induced from drinking the town water, which was proved by Mr. Allen
to contain about <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>5</sub> of a grain of lead per gallon. For six months he had
been out of health, and a week before his death he suffered from colic,
vomiting, constipation, and a blue line round the gums, and occasional
epileptiform seizures. After death the kidneys were found granular, and
the heart somewhat enlarged. The viscera were submitted to Mr. Allen
for analysis; no lead was found in the heart or brain, a slight, non-estimable
trace in the kidneys, and about a grain was separated from the
liver and spleen. Dr. Tidy, who was called in as an expert, gave a very
guarded opinion, rather against the theory of direct lead-poisoning; and
the verdict returned by the jury was to the effect that the deceased died
from granular kidney, accelerated by lead-poisoning. Murder by the
administration of doses of sugar of lead is rare, but such a case has
occurred.</p>

<p>At the Central Criminal Court, in December 1882, Louisa Jane Taylor
was indicted for poisoning Mary Ann Tregillis at Plumstead, and convicted.
From the evidence it appeared that the prisoner, who was
thirty-six years of age, came to reside with Mr. and Mrs. Tregillis, an
aged couple of eighty-five and eighty-one years respectively. The
prisoner was proved to have purchased at different times an ounce and
half an ounce of sugar of lead, and to have added a white powder to the
medicine of Mrs. Tregillis. The illness of the latter extended from
about August 23 to October 23&mdash;a period of two months. It is difficult
to say when the first dose could have been given, but it was probably
some time between August 13 and 23, while the administration, without
doubt, ceased on or before October 6, for on that date different nursing
arrangements were made. The symptoms observed were nausea, vomiting,
pain in the pit of the stomach, burning in the throat, very dark
teeth, a blue line round the gums, and slight jaundice. There was great
muscular weakness, with trembling of the hands, and a week before
death there was paralysis of the right side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[605]</a></span></p>

<p>Lead was discovered in most of the viscera, which were in great
part normal, but the kidneys were wasted, and the mucous membrane
blackened. The actual quantity of lead recovered by analysis was small,
viz., 16&middot;2 mgrms. (<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> grain) from the liver; from 8 ounces of brain,
3&middot;2 mgrms. (<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>20</sub> grain); from half of the stomach, 16&middot;2 mgrms. (<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> grain);
and from the spleen, the kidneys, and the lungs, small quantities. It is,
therefore, probable that, if the whole body had been operated upon, the
yield would have been more than &middot;15 grm. (a little over 2 grains); but
then, it must be remembered that the deceased lived, at least, seventeen
days after the last dose.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_787" id="Sect_787"></a>&sect; 787. <b>Post-mortem Appearances.</b>&mdash;In acute cases of poisoning by
the acetate, there may sometimes be found a slight inflammatory appearance
of the mucous membrane of the stomach and intestines. Orfila
considered that streaks of white points adherent to the mucous membrane
were pathognomonic; but there have been several cases in which only
negative or doubtful signs of inflammatory or other action have presented
themselves. A general contraction of the intestines has often been
noticed, and is of considerable significance when present; so also is a
grey-black mucous membrane caused by deposited lead sulphide. Loen
found in dogs and guinea-pigs, poisoned by lead, local inflammation
areas in the lungs, liver, and kidneys; but in no case fatty degeneration
of the epithelial cells of the liver, kidneys, or intestines. As a rule, no
unabsorbed poison will be found in the stomach; the case related by
Christison, in which a person died on the third day after taking at a
single dose some large quantity of acetate of lead; and at the autopsy a
fluid was obtained from the stomach, which had a sweet metallic taste,
on evaporation smelt of acetic acid, and from which metallic lead was
obtained&mdash;is so very extraordinary in every respect, that its entire
accuracy is to be questioned. In death from chronic lead-poisoning,
there is but little that can be called diagnostic; a granular condition of
the kidneys, and all the pathological changes dependent on such a condition,
are most frequently seen. If the patient has suffered from colic,
a constriction of portions of the intestine has been noticed; also, in cases
in which there has been long-standing paralysis of groups of muscles,
these muscles are wasted, and possibly degenerated. In instances, again,
in which lead has induced gout, the pathological changes dependent upon
gout will be prominent. The blue line around the gums, and sometimes
a coloration by sulphide of lead of portions of the intestines, may help a
proper interpretation of the appearances seen after death; but all who
have given any attention to the subject will agree that, simply from
pathological evidence, it is impossible to diagnose chronic lead-poisoning.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_788" id="Sect_788"></a>&sect; 788. <b>Physiological Action of Lead.</b>&mdash;The action of lead is still
obscure, but it is considered to have an effect mainly on the nervous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[606]</a></span>
centres. The paralysed muscles respond to the direct current, but not
to the induced, leading to the suspicion that the intramuscular terminations
of the nerves are paralysed, but that the muscular substance itself
is unattacked. On the other hand, the restriction of the action to groups
of muscles supports the theory of central action.</p>

<p>The lead colic is due to a true spasmodic constriction of the bowel, the
exciting cause of which lies in the walls of the bowel itself; the relief
given by pressure is explained by the pressure causing an an&aelig;mia of the
intestinal walls, and thus lessening their sensibility. The slowing of the
pulse produced by small doses is explained as due to a stimulation of the
inhibitory nerves; and, lastly, many nervous phenomena, such as epilepsy,
&amp;c., are in part due to imperfect elimination of the urinary excreta,
causing similar conditions to those observed in ur&aelig;mia.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_789" id="Sect_789"></a>&sect; 789. <b>Elimination of Lead.</b>&mdash;When a large dose of acetate or carbonate
is taken, part is transformed into more or less insoluble compounds&mdash;some
organic, others inorganic; so that a great portion is not absorbed
into the body at all, but passes into the intestines, where, meeting with
hydric sulphide, part is changed into sulphide, colouring the alvine evacuations
black. Some of the lead which is absorbed is excreted by the
kidneys, but the search often yields only traces. Thudichum<a name="FNanchor_853" id="FNanchor_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a> states
that in fourteen cases of lead-poisoning, in two only was obtained a
weighable quantity from a day&#8217;s urine; in the remaining twelve lead was
detected, but only by the brownish colour produced in an acid solution
of the ash by hydric sulphide.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>The elimination of lead by the kidneys is favoured by certain medicines,
such, for example, as potassic iodide. Annuschat found in dogs
poisoned by lead from 3&middot;8 to 4&middot;1 mgrms. in 100 c.c. of urine; but, after
doses of potassic iodide, the content of lead rose to 6&middot;9 and even to 14
mgrms. Lead appears to be eliminated by the skin, being taken up by the
epithelial cells, and minute, insoluble particles coming away with these
cells. If a person who has taken small doses of lead for a time be placed
in a sulphur water-bath, or have his skin moistened with a 5 per cent.
solution of sodium sulphide, the upper layer of the epidermis is coloured
dark; but the perspiration excited by pilocarpin or other agency contains
no lead.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_790" id="Sect_790"></a>&sect; 790. <b>Fatal Dose</b>&mdash;(<i>a.</i>) <b>Sugar of Lead.</b>&mdash;It may almost be said that
it is impossible to destroy human life with any single dose likely to be
taken or administered. In three cases an ounce (28&middot;3 grms.) has been
taken without fatal result. Although it must be allowed that repeated
moderate doses, extending over some time, are more dangerous to health
and life than a single large dose, yet there seems to be in some individuals
a great tolerance of lead. Christison has given &middot;18 grm. in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[607]</a></span>
divided doses daily for a long time without any bad effect, save the production
of a slight colic. Swieten has also given daily 3&middot;9 grms. (60
grains) in ten days without observing toxic effects. That, in other cases,
less than a grain per gallon of some lead compound dissolved in drinking-water,
or in some way introduced into the economy, causes serious illness,

sulphate) have been given largely in both acute and chronic cases;
in the acute, it stands to reason that it is well to ensure the presence of
plenty of sulphates in the stomach and intestines, in order to form the
sparingly soluble lead sulphate, should any residue remain; but to
expect this double decomposition to go on in the blood and tissues is not
based upon sound observation. The chronic lead-poisoning is best
treated by removal from the source of mischief, the administration of
large quantities of distilled water, and medicinal doses of potassic
iodide.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_792" id="Sect_792"></a>&sect; 792. <b>Localisation of Lead.</b>&mdash;In a dog, which was killed by chronic
lead-poisoning, Heubel found in the bones 0&middot;18 to 0&middot;27 per 1000 of
lead; in the kidneys, 0&middot;17 to 0&middot;20; liver, 0&middot;10 to 0&middot;33; spinal cord,
0&middot;06 to 0&middot;11; brain, 0&middot;04 to 0&middot;05; muscles, 0&middot;02 to 0&middot;04; in the intestines
traces, 0&middot;01 to 0&middot;02; in the spleen, the blood, and the bile, he also
only found traces. Ellenberger and Hofmeister found in the kidneys of
the sheep, 0&middot;44 to 0&middot;47; liver, 0&middot;36 to 0&middot;65; pancreas, 0&middot;54; salivary

0&middot;03 per 1000 of lead.</p>

<p>Without going so far as to say that lead is a natural constituent of the
body, it is certain that it may be frequently met with in persons who
have been apparently perfectly healthy, and quite free from all symptoms
of lead-poisoning. Legrip found in the liver and spleen of a healthy
person, 5&middot;4 mgrms. of lead oxide in every kilogram; Oidtmann, in the
liver of a man fifty-six years of age, 1 mgrm. of lead oxide per kilogram,
and in the spleen 3 mgrms. per kilogram. Hence, the analyst, in searching
for poison, must be very careful in his conclusions. Grave and
serious errors may also arise from complications; suppose, <i>e.g.</i>, that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[608]</a></span>
deceased person previous to death had partaken of game, and inadvertently
swallowed a shot&mdash;if the analyst had not carefully searched the
contents of the stomach for <i>solid</i> bodies, but merely treated them at once
with acid solvents, he would naturally get very decided lead reactions,
and would possibly conclude, and give evidence to the effect, that a
poisonous soluble salt of lead had been administered shortly before
death.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_793" id="Sect_793"></a>&sect; 793. <b>Detection and Estimation of Lead.</b>&mdash;A great number of fluids
(such as beer, wines, vinegar, water, &amp;c.), if they contain anything like
the amount of one-tenth of a milligramme in 100 c.c., will give a very
marked dark colour with <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>. It is, however, usually safest in the first
place to concentrate the liquid, to add an acid, and deposit the lead on
platinum, in the way to be shortly described. Nearly all the lead from
oils and fatty matter may be dissolved out by shaking up the fat with
dilute nitric acid; if necessary, the fat should previously be melted.</p>

<p>If (in the usual course of routine research) a hydrochloric acid solution
is obtained from the treatment or destruction of organic substances by
that agent, and lead sulphide (mixed possibly with other sulphides) is
filtered off, any arsenical sulphide may first be extracted from the filter
by ammonia, and any antimonious sulphide by sodic sulphide; then the
sulphide may be extracted by warm hydrochloric acid, which will leave
undissolved such sulphides as those of copper and mercury. On diluting
the liquid, and filtration at a boiling temperature, crystals of lead chloride
will be deposited on cooling.</p>

<p>If, however, organic matters are <i>specially</i> searched for lead, hydrochloric
acid is not the best solvent, but nitric should always be preferred;
and, if there is reason to think that the lead exists in the form of sulphate,
then the proper solvent is either the acetate or the tartrate of
ammonia; but, in either case, the solution should contain an excess of
ammonia. It must, however, be remembered that organic matters retain
lead with great tenacity, and that in all cases where it can with any convenience
be effected, the substances should be not only carbonised, but
burnt to an ash; for Boucher has shown<a name="FNanchor_854" id="FNanchor_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a> that carbon retains lead, and
that the lead in carbon resists to a considerable extent the action of
solvents.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>In the case of sulphate of lead, which may be always produced in an
ash from organic substances by previous treatment with sufficient sulphuric
acid, a very excellent method of identification is to convert it
into sugar of lead. To do this, it is merely necessary to boil it with
carbonate of ammonia, which changes it into carbonate of lead; treatment
with acetic acid will now give the acetate; the solution may (if the
lead is in very small quantity) be concentrated in a watch-glass, a drop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[609]</a></span>
evaporated to dryness on a circle of thin microscopic glass, and the
crystals examined by the microscope; the same film next exposed to the
fumes of <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>, which will blacken it; and lastly, the solution (which
should be sweet) tasted. A crystalline substance, possessing a sweet
taste, and blackening when exposed to <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>, can, under the circumstances,
be no other substance than acetate of lead.</p>

<p>If the analyst does not care for this method, there is room for
choice. Lead in solution can be converted into sulphide; in this case
it is, however, absolutely necessary that there should be no great excess
of acid, since as little as 2&middot;5 per cent. of free hydrochloric acid will prevent
all the lead going down. On obtaining the sulphide, the latter, as
already described, can be converted into chloride by hydrochloric acid,
and the crystalline chloride is extremely characteristic.</p>

<p>From the solution of the chloride the metal may be obtained in a solid
state by inserting a piece of zinc in the solution contained in a crucible;
the lead will be deposited gradually, and can be then collected, washed,
and finally fused into a little globule on charcoal. A lead bead flattens
easily when hit with a hammer, and makes a mark on paper. Solutions
of the chloride also give a heavy precipitate of lead sulphate, when treated
with a solution of sodic sulphate.</p>

<p>When lead is in very minute quantity, an electrolytic method is generally
preferable; the lead is precipitated on platinum by using exactly
the same apparatus as in Bloxam&#8217;s test, described at <a href="#Page_566">p. 566</a>; the liquid
to be tested being placed in the inner cell, the lead film may now be
identified, dissolved in nitric acid, and estimated by a colorimetric process.
For the estimation of the minute fractions of a grain by a colour method,
it is merely necessary to have a very dilute solution of acetate of lead,
to add a known volume of <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span> water to the liquid to be tested in a
Nessler cylinder, noting the colour, and add to another a known quantity
of the standard lead solution and the same quantity of <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span> as was added
to the first.</p>

<p>The process has an advantage which is great, viz., that it either detects
copper, or proves its absence at the same time; and there are few cases in
which the analyst does not look for copper as well as for lead. Lead, if
in sufficient quantity, may be most conveniently estimated as oxide, sulphate,
or chloride; the chief properties of these substances have been
already described.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_794" id="Sect_794"></a>&sect; 794. <b>The Detection of Lead in Tartaric Acid, in Lemonade, and
A&euml;rated Waters.</b>&mdash;To detect lead in tartaric acid a convenient method
is to burn it to an ash, digest in a little strong sulphuric acid, and then
add either sodic chloride or a drop of <span class="chemform">HCl</span>; lead, if present, is precipitated
as chloride, giving a pearly opalescence. Lemonades often contain
minute quantities of iron and copper as well as lead. Neither copper nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[610]</a></span>
iron are precipitated by ammonium sulphide in presence of potassic
cyanide. On the other hand, the sulphide of lead is not soluble in the
alkaline cyanides. Hence a liquid which, on the addition of potassium
cyanide and then ammonium sulphide, becomes dark coloured, or
from which a precipitate separates, contains lead.<a name="FNanchor_855" id="FNanchor_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a></p>

coating on such metals as platinum, iron, &amp;c., or in a state of fine division;
or, finally, as a bead. In thin films, copper has a yellowish or a
yellowish-red colour; it dissolves readily in nitric, slowly in hydrochloric
acid. If air be excluded, hydrochloric acid fails to dissolve copper, and
the same remark applies to ammonia; but, if there be free access of air,
ammonia also acts as a slow solvent. Metallic copper in a fine state of
division can be fused at a white heat to a bright bluish-green globule,
which, on cooling, is covered with black oxide.</p>

<p>With regard to salts, those of ammonium exert a solvent action on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[611]</a></span>
copper more decided than that of any others known. With the others,
however, the nature of the base exerts little influence, the action of the
salt depending chiefly on the nature of its acid radical. Thus, beginning
with the least effective, the following is the order of dissolving strength:&mdash;Nitrates,
sulphates, carbonates, and chlorides. It will then at once be
evident that a water, contaminated by sewage, and therefore containing

<p>Lehmann has made some useful researches on the amount of copper
taken up by fats under different conditions. 100 c.c. of strongly rancid
fat dissolved in fourteen days 8&middot;7 mgrms. of copper; but when heated to
160&deg; for one hour, and then allowed to stand, a similar amount was
found. Some rancid butter was rubbed into a brass bowl of 90 c.c. capacity,
and then allowed to stand for twenty-four hours; the butter became
of a blue-green colour. Into this dish, thus partially attacked by fatty
acids, 50 c.c. of rancid butter was poured in a melted condition, and
allowed to stand for twenty-four hours. The amount taken up was found
to be equal to 10 mgrms. of copper for every 100 c.c. of fluid butter.</p>

<p>Hilger found a fatty soup, which had stood twelve hours in a clean
copper vessel, to contain 0&middot;163 per cent. copper. According to Tschirch,
the easiest fatty salt to form is the oleate, hydrated copper oxide dissolving
in oleic acid with great ease, and even copper oxide dissolving to
some extent; the palmitate and the stearate are not so readily produced;
hence the amount of copper dissolved is greater in the case of olive oil
and butter (both rich in oleic acids) than in the case of the firmer animal
fats. Acid solutions, such as clarets, acetic acid, vinegars, and so forth, as
might be expected, dissolve more or less copper. The amount likely to
be dissolved in practice has been investigated by Lehmann. He steeped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[612]</a></span>
600 square metres of copper sheeting or brass sheeting in vessels holding
2 litres of acid claret; the sheets were in some of the experiments wholly
immersed, in others partly so. More copper was dissolved by the wine
when the copper was partly immersed than when it was wholly immersed;
and more copper was dissolved from brass sheeting than from
pure copper sheeting. With a sheet of copper, partly immersed, claret
may contain as much as 56 mgrms. per litre. Lehmann also investigated
the amount of copper, as acetate, which could be dissolved in wine before
the taste betrayed its presence: with 50 mgrms. per litre no copper taste;
with 100 mgrms. there was a weak after taste; with 150 mgrms. it was
scarcely drinkable, and there was a strong after taste; with 200 mgrms.
per litre it was quite undrinkable, and the colour was changed to bluish-green.
Vinegar, acting under the most favourable circumstances on sheet
brass or copper, dissolved, in seven days, 195 mgrms. of copper per litre
from the copper sheet, 195 from the brass sheet.</p>

<p>Lehmann discusses the amount of copper which may be taken at a
meal under the circumstance that everything eaten or drank has been
artificially coppered, but none &#8220;coppered&#8221; to the extent by which the
presence of the metal could be betrayed by the taste; and the following
is, he thinks, possible:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The total only amounts to 195 mgrms. of copper, which only slightly
exceeds a high medicinal dose. The metal is tasted more easily in liquids,
such as wine, than in bread; bread may be coppered so that at a meal a

<p>That preserved vegetables are made of a bright and attractive green
colour by impregnation with copper, from the deliberate use of copper
vessels for this purpose, is a fact long known. Green peas especially
have been coloured in this way, and a number of convictions for this
offence have taken place in England.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_800" id="Sect_800"></a>&sect; 800. <b>The &#8220;Coppering&#8221; of Vegetables.</b>&mdash;The fact that green vegetables,
such as peas, beans, cucumbers, and so forth, preserve their green colour,
if boiled in copper vessels, has long been known. In this &#8220;coppering&#8221;
the French have been more active than the English traders; the French
operate in two different ways. One method is, to dip from 60 to 70
litres of the green vegetables in 100 litres of 0&middot;3 to 0&middot;7 per cent. of
copper sulphate, to leave them there for from five to fifteen minutes, then
to remove them, wash and sterilise in an autoclave. A second method is
to put the vegetables into a copper vessel, the wall of which is connected
with the negative pole of an electric current, the positive pole dips in a
solution of salt in the same vessel, the current is allowed to pass for three
minutes, and the vegetables are afterwards sterilised. Fruits are simply
allowed to stand with water in copper vessels, the natural acidity of the
juice dissolving sufficient copper.</p>

<p>The amount of copper taken up in this way is appreciable, but yet not
so much as might be expected; the prosecutions for selling &#8220;coppered&#8221; peas
in England have been based upon quantities varying from 1 to 3 grains
per lb.; the highest published amount of copper found in peas artificially
coloured is 0&middot;27 per kilo., or 18&middot;9 grains per lb.</p>

<p>The reason why vegetables preserve their green colour longer when
treated with a copper salt has been proved by Tschirch<a name="FNanchor_869" id="FNanchor_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a> to be owing to
the formation of a phyllocyanate of copper.</p>

<p>Phyllocyanic acid is a derivative of chlorophyll, and allied to it in composition;
the formula of <span class="chemform">C<sub>24</sub>H<sub>28</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub></span> has been ascribed to it. Under the
action of acids generally, mineral or organic, chlorophyll splits up into
this acid and other compounds. Copper phyllocyanate, <span class="chemform">(C<sub>24</sub>H<sub>27</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cu</span>,
contains 8&middot;55 per cent. of copper; it forms black lamell&aelig;, dissolving
easily in strong alcohol and chloroform, but insoluble in water; it is a
little soluble in ether, insoluble in petroleum ether, and dissolved neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[615]</a></span>
by dilute acetic acid, nor by dilute nor concentrated hydrochloric acid.
The compound dissolves in caustic alkali on warming. In alcohol it
forms a beautiful non-fluorescent solution. A solution of 1&nbsp;: 100,000 is
still coloured strongly green.</p>

<p>This solution, in a stratum of 25 mm. thick, gives four absorption
bands when submitted to spectroscopic observation, and Tschirch has
worked out a process of estimation of the amount of copper phyllocyanate
based upon the disappearance of these bands on dilution.</p>

<p>Green substances, so carefully treated that they only contain phyllocyanate
of copper, would yield but small quantities of copper, and probably they
would not be injurious to health; but the coppering is usually more
extensive, and copper leguminate and other compounds are formed; for the
vegetables, when exhausted by alcohol, give a residue which, successively
exhausted by water, by soda-lye, and lastly by hydrochloric acid, parts
with copper into the three solvents mentioned.</p>

<p>It might be argued that, from the insoluble character of the phyllocyanate
of copper, and especially seeing that it does not dissolve in strong
hydrochloric acid, that it would be perfectly innocuous; but Tschirch
has proved that, whether the tartrate of copper (dissolving easily in water),
or copper oxide (not dissolving at all in water, but soluble in hydrochloric
acid), or phyllocyanate of copper (insoluble both in water and in
hydrochloric acid) be used, the physiological effect is the same.</p>

<p>Copper may be found in spirits, owing to the use of copper condensers,
a remark which applies also to the essential oils, such as <i>oleum cajepute</i>,
<i>menth&aelig;</i>, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_870" id="FNanchor_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a> In France, it has been added fraudulently to absinthe, to

<p><b>Sulphate of Copper</b>, <b>Cupri Sulphas</b>, <span class="chemform">CuSO<sub>4</sub>5H<sub>2</sub>O</span>.&mdash;This well-known
salt is soluble in water at ordinary temperature, 3 parts of water
dissolving 1 of the sulphate; but boiling water dissolves double its
weight; 1 part of copper sulphate dissolves in 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> of glycerin; it reddens
litmus, and is slightly efflorescent; its solution responds to all the usual
tests for copper and sulphuric acid. A watery solution of the salt to
which twice its volume of a solution of chlorine has been added, gives,
when treated with ammonia in excess, a clear sapphire-blue solution,
leaving nothing undissolved, and thus showing the absence of iron.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[616]</a></span>
Besides iron, sulphate of copper has been found to contain zincic
sulphate.</p>

<p><b>Nitrate of Copper</b>, <span class="chemform">Cu(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>3H<sub>2</sub>O</span>, is officinal; it is very soluble.</p>

<p><b>Cuprum Aluminatum.</b>&mdash;A preparation, called cuprum aluminatum
(<i>Pierre divine</i>), is in use in France and Germany, chiefly as an external
wash. It is composed of 16 parts cupric sulphate, 16 potassic nitrate,
16 alum, fused in a crucible, a little camphor being afterwards added.</p>

<p>Regular and irregular medical practitioners, veterinary surgeons, farriers,
and grooms, all use sulphate of copper (bluestone) as an application to
wounds. Copper as an <i>internal</i> remedy is not in favour either with
quacks or vendors of patent medicines. The writer has not yet found
any patent pill or liquid containing it.</p>

<p>(2) <b>Copper in the Arts.</b>&mdash;Copper is used very extensively in the arts;
it enters into the composition of a number of alloys, is one of the chief
constituents of the common bronzing powders, is contained in many of
the lilac and purple fires of the pyrotechnist, and in a great variety of
pigments. The last-mentioned, being of special importance, will be
briefly described:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p><a name="Sect_802" id="Sect_802"></a>&sect; 802. <b>Dose&mdash;Medicinal Dose of Copper.</b>&mdash;Since sulphate of copper
is practically the only salt administered internally, the dose is generally
expressed as so many grains of sulphate. This salt is given in quantities
of from &middot;016 to &middot;129 grm. (<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> to 2 grains) as an astringent or tonic; as an
emetic, from &middot;324 to &middot;648 grm. (5 to 10 grains).</p>

<p>The sulphate of copper is given to horses and cattle in such large doses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[617]</a></span>
as from 30 up to 120 grains (1&middot;9 to 7&middot;7 grms.); to sheep, from 1&middot;3 to 2&middot;6

which has no local action, nor does it precipitate albumin. <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> to <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>
mgrm. of copper oxide in this form, administered subcutaneously, was
fatal to frogs, &middot;05 grm. to rabbits, &middot;4 grm. to dogs. The direct excitability
of the voluntary muscles was gradually extinguished, and death
took place from heart paralysis. Vomiting was only noticed when the
poison was administered by the stomach.<a name="FNanchor_873" id="FNanchor_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a> The temperature of animals

<p>Roger<a name="FNanchor_874" id="FNanchor_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a> experimented on the effect of copper leguminate which was
administered subcutaneously; he found gradual increasing paralysis of
the motor spinal tracts, which finally destroyed life by paralysis of the
breathing centre. The heart beat after the breathing had stopped. The
irritability and contractility of the muscles of frogs were lost, while
sensibility remained. He also found that, if the copper was injected into
the intestinal vessels, the dose had to be doubled in order to destroy life;
this is, doubtless, because the liver, as it were, strained the copper off
and excreted it through the bile. Roger was unable to destroy life by
large doses of copper given by the mouth, for then vomiting supervened
and the poison in great part was removed.</p>

<p>Bernatzic<a name="FNanchor_875" id="FNanchor_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a> considers that the poisonous properties of copper are
similar to those of zinc and silver. He says: &#8220;Silver, copper, and zinc
are, in their medicinal application, so much allied that, with regard to
their action, they graduate one into the other and show only minor
differences; copper, which is a little the more poisonous of the three so
far as its remote action is concerned, stands between the other two. If
taken, in not too small a quantity, for a long time, the functional activity
of the muscular and nervous systems is influenced injuriously, the
development of the animal cells is inhibited, the number of the red
blood corpuscles decreased, and therefore the oxidising process and
metabolism are likewise diminished, leading ultimately to a condition
of marked cachexia. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. From a toxic point of view, the three
metals named also stand near each other, and their compounds differ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[618]</a></span>
from other metals injurious to the organism in this, that they do not
produce notable changes of the tissues or coarse functional disturbances
leading to death as other poisonous metals, and therefore are not to be
considered poisons in the same sense as lead, mercury, arsenic, antimony,
phosphorus are considered poisons; for, on stopping the entry of the
poison, any injurious effect is completely recovered from and the
functions again become normal.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lehmann<a name="FNanchor_876" id="FNanchor_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a> has also experimented on the effects of copper; his experiments
were made on both animals and men. He found that small
quantities were more thoroughly absorbed than medium or large doses;
the method of separation appeared to be different in different animals&mdash;thus,
the chief copper-excreting organ in dogs is the liver; in rabbits,
the intestine; and in man, the kidneys. Of 3 mgrms. of copper taken
by a man in three days, 1 mgrm., or a third, was recovered from the
urine. Lehmann experimented on 6 rabbits, 4 cats, and 1 dog. During
the first few days the animals were given 10 to 30 mgrms. of copper, in
the form of a salt, in their food; then the dose was raised to 50 mgrms.
or even to 100 mgrms., and the experiment continued for from two to
four months; in one case, six months. The sulphate, acetate, chloride,
oleate, butyrate, and lactate were all tried, but no essential difference in
action discovered. Apart from slight vomiting, and in a few cases, as
shown by <i>post-mortem</i>, a slight catarrh of the stomach, the animals
remained well. A few increased in weight. Nervous symptoms, cramps,
convulsions, diarrh&#339;a, or the reverse, were not observed. The analysis
of the organs showed considerable copper absorption; the liver of the
cats gave a mean amount of 12 mgrms. of copper, and in the other organs
there was more copper than is found in cases of acute poisoning.</p>

<p>None of these daily doses had the least effect.</p>

<p>Five farther experiments showed that 75 to 127 mgrms. of copper in
peas and beans, divided in two meals, could be taken daily without
effect; but if 127 mgrms. were taken at one meal in 200 grms. of peas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[619]</a></span>
then, after a few hours, there might be vomiting; and Lehmann concludes
that doses of copper in food of about 100 mgrms. may produce
some transient derangement in health, such as sickness, a nasty taste in
the mouth, and a general feeling of discomfort, but nothing more; some
slight colicky pains and one or two loose motions are also possible, but
were not observed in Lehmann&#8217;s experiments.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_804" id="Sect_804"></a>&sect; 804. <b>Toxic Dose of Copper Salts.</b>&mdash;This is a difficult question,
because copper salts generally act as an emetic, and therefore very large
doses have been taken without any great injury. In fact, it may be laid
down that a medium dose taken daily for a considerable time is far more
likely to injure health, or to destroy life, than a big dose taken at once.
In Tschirch&#8217;s<a name="FNanchor_877" id="FNanchor_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a> careful experiments on animals, he found 10 mgrm. doses
of <span class="chemform">CuO</span> given daily to rabbits, the weight of which varied from 1200 to
1650 grms., caused injury to health, that is, about 3&middot;5 mgrms. per kilo.
If man is susceptible in the same proportion, then daily doses of 227&middot;5
mgrms. (or about 3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> grains) would cause serious poisonous symptoms;
although double or treble that quantity might in a single dose be swallowed
and, if thrown up speedily, no great harm result. 120 grms. of
sulphate of copper have been swallowed, and yet the patient recovered

<p><a name="Sect_805" id="Sect_805"></a>&sect; 805. <b>Cases of Acute Poisoning.</b>&mdash;Acute poisoning by salts of copper
is rare; in the ten years ending 1892, there were registered in England
8 deaths from this cause&mdash;3 suicidal (2 males, 1 female) and 5 accidental
(4 males, 1 female). The symptoms produced by the sulphate of copper
are those of a powerful irritant poison: there is immediate and violent
vomiting; the vomited matters are of a greenish colour&mdash;a green distinguished
from bile by the colour changing to blue on the addition of
ammonia. There is pain in the stomach, and in a little time affections
of the nervous system, as shown by spasms, cramps, paralysis, and even
tetanus. Jaundice is a frequent symptom, if life is prolonged sufficiently
to admit of its occurrence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[620]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the best examples of acute poisoning by copper sulphate is
recorded by Maschka.<a name="FNanchor_882" id="FNanchor_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a> A youth, sixteen years old, took an unknown
large dose of powdered copper sulphate, mixed with water. Half an
hour afterwards there was violent vomiting, and he was taken to the
hospital. There was thirst, retching, constriction in the throat, a coppery
taste in the mouth, and pain in the epigastrium, which was painful
on pressure. The vomit was of a blue colour, and small undissolved
crystals of copper sulphate were obtained from it. The patient was pale,
the edges of the lips and the angles of the mouth were coloured blue,
the surface of the tongue had also a blue tint, the temperature was
depressed, the extremities cold, nails cyanotic, and the pulse small and
quick. Several loose greenish-yellow evacuations were passed; there
was no blood. The urine was scanty, but contained neither blood nor
albumen. During the night the patient was very restless; the next
morning he had violent headache, pain in the epigastrium, burning in
the mouth and gullet, but no vomiting. The urine was scanty, contained
blood, albumen, and colouring matter from the bile. On the fourth day
there was marked jaundice. The mucous membrane was very pale, the
temperature low, pulse frequent, and great weakness, cardiac oppression,
and restlessness were experienced. There were diarrh&#339;a and tenesmus,
the motions being streaked with blood; the urine also contained much
blood. The liver was enlarged. The patient died in a state of collapse
on the seventh day.</p>

changes noted were in the liver, kidneys, and stomach. The substance
of the liver was friable and fatty; in the gall-bladder there were but a
few drops of dark tenacious bile. The kidneys were swollen, the cortical
substance coloured yellow, the pyramids compressed and pale brown. In
the mucous membrane of the stomach there was an excoriation the size
of a shilling, in which the epithelium was changed into a dirty brown
mass, easily detached, laying bare the muscular substance beneath, but
otherwise normal.</p>

Orfila,<a name="FNanchor_883" id="FNanchor_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a> the stomach was so much inflamed and thickened that towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[621]</a></span>
the pyloric end the opening into the intestine was almost obliterated.
The small intestines throughout were inflamed, and perforation had taken
place, so that part of the green liquid had escaped into the abdomen.
The large intestines were distended in some parts, contracted in others,
and there was ulceration of the rectum. In other cases a striking discoloration
of the mucous membrane, being changed by the contact of
the salt to a dirty bluish-green, has been noticed, and, when present, will
afford valuable indications.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_808" id="Sect_808"></a>&sect; 808. <b>Chronic Poisoning by Copper.</b>&mdash;Symptoms have arisen among
workers in copper or its salts, and also from the use of food accidentally
contaminated by copper, which lend support to the existence of chronic
poisoning. In the symptoms there is a very great resemblance to those
produced by lead. There is a green line on the margin of the gums.
Dr. Clapton<a name="FNanchor_884" id="FNanchor_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a> found the line very distinct in a sailor and two working
coppersmiths, and the two men were also seen by Dr. Taylor. Cases of
chronic poisoning among coppersmiths have also been treated by Dr.
Cameron,<a name="FNanchor_885" id="FNanchor_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a> but this symptom was not noticed. Corrigan speaks of the

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>Metallic copper itself is not poisonous. A Mr. Charles Reed has published
a letter in the <i>Chemical News</i> of Jan. 12, 1894, stating that he
was, when a boy, wounded in the shin by a copper percussion-cap, and the
cap remained in the tissues; it was removed from the shin after a sojourn
thereof some twelve years; about the year 1873 he noticed that whenever
a piece of clean iron or steel came in contact with his perspiration it
was at once covered with a bright coating of copper, and this continued
until the percussion-cap was removed. Presuming the truth of this, it
shows conclusively that metallic copper deposited in the tissues is in
itself not poisonous, and farther, that one method of elimination is by the
skin. The experiments already cited throw doubt as to whether
repeated small doses of copper taken for a long time produce in a
scientific sense chronic poisoning; those which apparently support
the view that there is such a thing as chronic poisoning by copper,
have been produced by copper mixed with other metals; and there
is the possibility that these cases are really due to lead or arsenic,
and not to copper. The great use of late years of solutions of copper
sulphate as a dressing to plants, for the purpose of preventing the ravages
of various parasites, has provided, so far as animals are concerned, much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[622]</a></span>
material for the judgment of this question. Sheep have been fed with
vines which have been treated with copper sulphate, oxen and pigs have
consumed for a long time grass treated with a 3 per cent. of copper
sulphate, without the least health disturbance. Mach<a name="FNanchor_887" id="FNanchor_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a> has fed cows
with green food coppered up to 200 mgrms. of copper sulphate, without
observing the slightest bad effect, for long periods of time; and Tschirch<a name="FNanchor_888" id="FNanchor_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a>
summarises the evidence as to chronic poisoning as follows:&mdash;&#8220;So it
appears the contention that there is no chronic poisoning in men or animals
is at present uncontradicted; it is farther to be considered proved
that the small amounts of copper naturally in food, or carefully introduced
into food, are not injurious to the health of those that take such food,
because the liver, kidneys, and other organs excrete the copper through the
urine and bile, and prevent a pernicious accumulation.&#8221; At the same
time, Tschirch does not consider the question is definitely settled; the
experiments should, he thinks, have been continued not for months, but
for years, to obtain a trustworthy judgment.</p>

<p>It may also be remarked that, if we are to rely upon the separation of
copper by the kidneys and the liver, those organs are presumed to be in
a healthy state, which is not the case with a percentage of the population;
to persons whose liver or kidneys are unsound, even the small
amounts of copper found in &#8220;coppered&#8221; peas may act as a poison, and
the experiments previously detailed throw no light upon the action of
copper under such circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_809" id="Sect_809"></a>&sect; 809. <b>Detection and Estimation of Copper.</b>&mdash;Copper may occur
either in the routine process of precipitating by <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>, or it may, as is
generally the case, be searched for specially. If copper is looked for in
a precipitate produced by <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>, it is taken for granted that the precipitate
has first been treated successively by carbonate of ammonia, sulphide of
sodium, and hydrochloric acid; in other words, arsenic, antimony, and
lead have been removed. The moist precipitate is now treated with
warm nitric acid, which dissolves out copper sulphide with separation of
sulphur; if there is sufficient copper, the fluid shows a blue colour, which
of itself is an indication of copper being present. The further tests are&mdash;(1)
Ammonia gives a deeper blue; (2) ferrocyanide of potash a brown-red
colour or precipitate; (3) a few drops mixed with a solution of
tartrate of soda, alkalised with sodic hydrate, and boiled with a crystal
or two of grape-sugar, gives quickly a red precipitate of oxide of copper;
(4) a needle or a clean iron wire, or any simple galvanic combination,
immersed in, or acting on, the liquid, soon becomes coated with the very
characteristic reddish metallic film. Various other tests might be mentioned,
but the above are ample.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[623]</a></span></p>

<h5>Special Examinations for Copper.</h5>

<p>(1) <b>In Water and Liquids generally.</b>&mdash;The liquid may be concentrated,
and the copper separated by electrolysis. A simple method is to
place the liquid in a large platinum dish, and insert a piece of zinc,
adding a sufficient quantity of <span class="chemform">ClH</span> to dissolve the zinc entirely; the
copper is found as an adherent film on the inner surface of the dish. It
is neater, however, and more accurate, to connect the platinum dish with
the negative plate of a battery, suspending in the liquid the positive
electrode. The modifications of this method are numerous; some
chemists use (especially for small quantities of copper) two small platinum
electrodes, either of foil or of wire, and on obtaining the film, weigh the
electrode, then dissolve the copper off by nitric acid, and re-weigh. Such
solid substances as peas are conveniently mashed up into a paste with
water and <span class="chemform">ClH</span>; an aliquot part is carefully weighed and put in a
platinum dish, connected, as before described, with a battery; at the end
of from twelve to twenty-four hours all the copper is deposited, and the
dish with its film dried and weighed. The weight of the clean dish,
<i>minus</i> the coppered dish, of course equals the copper. Fat and oils are
best thoroughly washed with hot acid water, which will, if properly performed,
extract all the copper. By the use of separating funnels and
wet filters, the fat or oil can be separated from the watery liquid.</p>

<p>A galvanic test has been proposed, which is certainly very delicate,
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>100</sub> of a mgrm. in solution being recognised with facility. A zinc platinum
couple is made with two wires; on leaving this in an acid liquid
containing a mere trace of copper, after several hours the platinum will be
found discoloured. If the discoloration is from copper, on exposing the
wire to hydrobromic acid fumes (easily produced from the action of
potassic bromide and sulphuric acid) and bromine, the wire will become
of a violet colour. This colour is easily recognised by rubbing the wire
on a piece of porcelain.<a name="FNanchor_889" id="FNanchor_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a></p>

number of volumetric processes have been devised for the estimation of
copper, but for the purposes of this work it is unnecessary to detail them.
When copper is in too small a quantity to be weighed, it may then be
estimated by a colorimetric process.</p>

<p>One of the best of these is based upon the brown colour which ferrocyanide
of potash produces in very dilute solutions of copper. A standard
copper solution is obtained by dissolving sulphate of copper in a litre of
water, so that each c.c. contains 0&middot;1 mgrm. Cu, and a solution of ferrocyanide
of potash in water is prepared, strength 4 per cent. It is also
convenient to have a solution of nitrate of ammonia, which is found to
render the reaction much more delicate.</p>

<p>The further details are on the well-known lines of colorimetric estimations.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_816" id="Sect_816"></a>&sect; 816. <b>Toxic Effects of Bismuth.</b>&mdash;From the researches of Meyer and
Steinfeld<a name="FNanchor_892" id="FNanchor_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a> on animals, it appears that if birds or mammals are poisoned
with bismuth salts introduced subcutaneously, or by direct injection, into
the veins, death follows in from twenty-four to forty-eight hours, the
fatal issue being preceded by convulsions; after death, the colon is
intensely blackened, and it may be ulcerated, while the small intestines
and the stomach are healthy. If, however, sulphur preparations are
given by the mouth, there is then blackening of the stomach, and there
may also be ulcers. Meyer is of the opinion that <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span> precipitates bismuth
in the parenchyma, and the particles occluding the capillaries thus
cause small local necroses; that which escapes precipitation is mainly
excreted by the kidneys. Poisonous symptoms in man have been known

colour of the mucous membrane of the mouth and ulceration, also catarrh
of the intestines, and the inflammatory condition of the kidneys usual
when that organ has to excrete metallic substances not natural to the body,
the &#8220;metallniere,&#8221; or metal kidney, of the German writers. One case is
recorded of death in nine days of an adult after taking 7&middot;7 grms. (2 drms.)
of bismuth subnitrate. The recorded symptoms were a metallic taste in
the mouth, pain in the throat, vomiting, purging, coldness of the surface,
and spasms of the arms and legs. A <i>post-mortem</i> examination showed
inflammatory changes in the gullet, windpipe, and throughout the intestinal
canal. Recovery has, however, taken place from a single dose three
times the amount mentioned. It is possible that the fatal case was due
to impure bismuth.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_817" id="Sect_817"></a>&sect; 817. <b>Extraction and Detection of Bismuth in Animal Matters.</b>&mdash;Bismuth
appears to be excreted principally by the bowels as sulphide
of bismuth; but it has also been detected in the urine, spleen, and liver;
and Lubinsky has found it in the saliva and in the epithelium of the
mouth of persons taking one of its preparations. Without denying the
possibility of its existing in a soluble state in the saliva, its presence in the
mouth may, under such circumstances, be ascribed to the lodgment of
particles of subnitrate or subcarbonate of bismuth in the interstices of
the teeth, &amp;c. It will then be evident that, if a person is supposed to
have been poisoned by a large dose of bismuth, and the analyst fail to find
it in the stomach, the contents of the bowels should be next examined.</p>

<p>The extraction of bismuth must be undertaken by nitric acid, and
boiling for at least two hours may be necessary to dissolve it out from
the tissues. Such organs as the liver and spleen are boiled in a finely
divided state with a litre of dilute nitric acid (strength, 5 per cent.), for
the time mentioned, filtered, and the filtrate evaporated to dryness; the
remainder is then carbonised by strong nitric acid; and, finally, the charcoal
is boiled with equal parts of nitric acid and water, and the whole
evaporated to dryness. By this method every trace of bismuth is
extracted. The dry residue may now be brought into solution, and tested
for bismuth. The best solvent for the nitrate of bismuth is dilute nitric
acid 50 per cent.; the dry residue is therefore dissolved in 100 or 200 c.c.
of the acid, and fractional parts taken for examination:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1)  The solution, poured into a large volume of warm distilled water,
gives a crystalline precipitate of subnitrate of bismuth. The only metal
giving a similar reaction is antimony, and this is excluded by the method
employed.</p>

<p>(2)  The filtered fluid gives on addition of sodic chloride a precipitate
of oxychloride. This, again, is distinguished from oxychloride of
antimony by its insolubility in tartaric acid.</p>

<p>(3)  Any bismuth precipitate, fused with soda on charcoal, gives a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[627]</a></span>
brittle bead of bismuth; the coal is coated whilst warm a dark orange-yellow,
on cooling citron-yellow.</p>

<p>(4) The bead may be identified by powdering it, placing it in a short
subliming tube, and passing over it dry chlorine. The powder first turns
black, then melts to an amber-yellow fluid, and finally, by prolonged

specially for the detection of bismuth in copper (but by no means confined
to mineral analysis), utilises the fact that, if iodide of lead be
precipitated from a fluid containing the least trace of bismuth, instead of
the yellow iodide the scales assume a dark orange to a crimson tint. A
solution of nitrate of lead is used; to the nitric acid solution ammonia
and carbonate of ammonia added; the precipitate washed, and dissolved
in acetic acid; and, finally, excess of iodide of potassium added. It is
said that thus so small a quantity as &middot;00025 grm. may be detected in
copper with the greatest ease, the iodide of lead becoming dark orange;
&middot;001 grain imparts a reddish-brown tinge, and &middot;01 grain a crimson.</p>

any quantity easily weighed, is, perhaps, best accomplished by fusing the
sulphide, oxide, or other compound of bismuth, in a porcelain crucible
with cyanide of potassium; the bismuth is reduced to the metallic state,
the cyanide can be dissolved out, and the metallic powder washed (first
with water, lastly with spirit), dried, and weighed.</p>

<p>This observation admits of many applications, and may be usefully
taken advantage of in the separation of bismuth from the nitric acid solution
of such animal matters as liver, &amp;c. The acid liquid is partially
neutralised by ammonia, and, on diluting with warm water containing a
little sodium or ammonium chloride, the whole of the bismuth is precipitated
as oxychloride, which may be collected, and fused with cyanide of
potassium, as above.</p>

<p>If the bismuth precipitate is in small quantity, or if a number of
estimations of bismuth are to be made, it is most convenient to use a
volumetric process. In the case first mentioned, the oxychloride could
be dissolved in nitric acid, sodium acetate added in excess, and sufficient
acetic acid to dissolve any precipitate which has been produced, and then
titrated by the following method, which we also owe to Mr. Pattison
Muir:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p><b>Estimation of Bismuth by Potassium Dichromate.</b><a name="FNanchor_898" id="FNanchor_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a>&mdash;A solution of
recrystallised potassium dichromate (strength, 1 per cent.) is prepared.
A known weight of pure bismuthous oxide (<span class="chemform">Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub></span>) is dissolved in excess
of nitric acid, and a solution of sodium acetate is added to this liquid
until a copious white precipitate is thrown down; acetic acid is then
added in quantity sufficient to dissolve the precipitate completely, and to
insure that, when the liquid is made up with water to a fixed volume,
no precipitate shall be formed. A certain volume of this liquid is withdrawn
by means of a pipette, placed in a beaker, and heated to boiling;
the potassium dichromate is then gradually run in from a burette, the
liquid being boiled between each addition of the solution, until a drop
of the supernatant liquid gives a faint reddish-brown coloration when
spotted with silver nitrate on a white slab.</p>

<p>Another very generally applicable volumetric method for bismuth has

soluble in nitric acid. The process is performed by precipitating the
bismuth by excess of oxalic acid, dissolving the precipitate (first purified
from free oxalic acid) in dilute hydrochloric acid, and lastly, titrating by
permanganate. The absence of free hydrochloric acid before precipitating
must be insured.</p>

glittering, metallic bead, or a dull grey powder. It does not lose weight
on ignition, and is soluble in dilute nitric acid.</p>

75&middot;27 per cent., Cl, 24&middot;73 per cent., is a dense, white, curdy precipitate,
when produced in the wet way. It is very insoluble in water, dilute
nitric acid, and dilute sulphuric acid; in many warm solutions (especially
aqueous solutions of the chlorides generally), the alkaline and alkaline-earthy
nitrates, and tartaric acid solutions, the silver is dissolved to an
appreciable extent, but deposited again on diluting and cooling. The
complete solvents of chloride of silver are&mdash;ammonia, cyanide of potassium,
and hyposulphite of soda. Chloride of silver cannot be fused at
a high heat without some slight loss by volatilisation; on coal in the
R.F., it fuses very easily to a globule. It can with soda be reduced to
metal, and can also readily be reduced by ignition in a current of
hydrogen, carbon oxide, or carburetted hydrogen gas.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_821" id="Sect_821"></a>&sect; 821. <b>Sulphide of Silver</b>, <span class="chemform">Ag<sub>2</sub>S</span> = 248; specific gravity, 7&middot;2; Ag, 87&middot;1
per cent., S, 12&middot;9 per cent., when prepared in the wet way, is a black
precipitate, insoluble in water, dilute acids, and alkaline sulphides. If
ignited in hydrogen it may be reduced to the metallic state; it is soluble
in nitric acid, with separation of sulphur.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_822" id="Sect_822"></a>&sect; 822. <b>Preparations of Silver used in Medicine and the Arts.</b></p>

<p>(1) <b>Medicinal Preparations</b>:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p><b>Nitrate of Silver</b>, <span class="chemform">AgNO<sub>3</sub></span>; Ag, 63&middot;51 per cent., <span class="chemform">N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub></span>, 36&middot;49 per cent.
This salt is either sold crystallised in colourless rhombic prisms, or in the
form of small white pencils or sticks. It gives the reactions for silver
and nitric acid, and stains the skin black. 100 parts, dissolved in distilled
water, should give, with hydrochloric acid, a precipitate which,
when washed and dried, weighs 83&middot;4 parts. The silver is, however, far
more quickly estimated by the blowpipe than in the wet way. One grm.
fused in a cavity on charcoal should give a little globule of metallic
silver, weighing about &middot;6351 grm. The chief adulterations of this
substance are copper, lead, and nitrate of potash. If all the silver is
precipitated by hydrochloric acid, carefully filtered off, and the filtrate
evaporated to dryness, any residue will denote adulteration or impurity.</p>

<p><b>Argenti Oxidum</b>, <b>Oxide of Silver</b>, <span class="chemform">Ag<sub>2</sub>O</span> = 232; Ag, 93&middot;19 per cent.&mdash;A
dark olive-brown powder, soluble in ammonia and nitric acid. By
ignition it readily yields metallic silver. The P.B. directs that 29 grains
of the oxide should yield 27 of metallic silver.</p>

<p><b>Nitrate of Silver and Potash</b> (<b>Argentum nitricum cum kali nitrico</b>),
AgNO<sub>3</sub> + KNO<sub>3</sub>.&mdash;This preparation is in most of the pharmacop&#339;ias,
Austrian, German, Danish, Swedish, Russian, Swiss, and the British; it
is directed by the B.P. to be composed of 1 part of silver nitrate and 1<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[630]</a></span>
part of potassic nitrate fused together. A &#8220;toughened silver nitrate&#8221; is made
by fusing together potassic nitrate 5, silver nitrate 95. Mild caustic
points are used by oculists by fusing 1 of silver nitrate with 2, 3, 3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>, and
4 parts of potassic nitrate.</p>

<p>(2) <b>Silver in the Arts.</b>&mdash;The uses of the metal in coinage, articles for
domestic purposes, for ornament, &amp;c., are too well known to require
enumeration. The only forms in which silver is likely to give rise to
accident are the salts used in medicine, photography, in the dyeing of hair,
and in the manufacture of marking inks.</p>

<p><b>Hair-dyes.</b>&mdash;About one-half of the hair-dyes in use are made with
nitrate of silver. The following are only a few of the recipes:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p><b>Aqua Orientalis.</b>&mdash;Grain silver 2 drms., nitric acid 1 oz., steel filings
4 drms., distilled water 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> oz.&mdash;the whole finally made up to 3<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> fluid ozs.,
and filtered.</p>

<p><b>Argentan Tincture.</b>&mdash;Nitrate of silver 1 drachm, rose water 1 fluid
oz., sufficient nitrate of copper to impart a greenish tint.</p>

<p><b>Eau d&#8217;Afrique.</b>&mdash;Two solutions&mdash;one of nitrate of silver, the other of
potash, containing ammonium sulphide.</p>

<p>The photographer uses various salts of silver, the chief of which are&mdash;the
nitrate, iodide, bromide, cyanide, and chloride of silver.</p>

<p><b>Marking Inks.</b>&mdash;Some of the more important recipes for marking ink
are as follows:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Nitrate of silver 1&middot;0 part, hot distilled water 3&middot;6 parts, mucilage, previously
rubbed with sap-green, 1&middot;0 part. With this is sold a &#8220;pounce,&#8221;
or preparation consisting of a coloured solution of sodic carbonate. Another
preparation is very similar, but with the addition of ammonia and some
colouring matter, such as indigo, syrup of buckthorn, or sap-green. A
third is made with tartaric acid and nitrate of silver, dissolved in ammonia
solution, and coloured.</p>

<p><b>Redwood&#8217;s Ink</b> consists of equal parts of nitrate of silver and potassic
bitartrate, dissolved in ammonia, with the addition of archil green
and sugar; according to the formula, 100 parts should equal 16&middot;6 of
silver nitrate.</p>

<p><b>Soubeiran&#8217;s Ink</b> is composed of cupric nitrate 3, argentic nitrate 8, sodic
carbonate 4, and the whole made up to 100 parts, in solution of ammonia.
In one of Mr. Reade&#8217;s inks, besides silver, an ammoniacal solution of a
salt of gold is used.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_823" id="Sect_823"></a>&sect; 823. <b>Medicinal Dose of Silver Compounds.</b>&mdash;The nitrate and the
oxide of silver are given in doses from &middot;0162 to &middot;1296 grm. (<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> grain to 2
grains). Anything like &middot;1944 to &middot;2592 grm. (3 or 4 grains) would be considered
a large, if not a dangerous dose; but nothing definite is known as
to what would be a <i>poisonous</i> dose.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_824" id="Sect_824"></a>&sect; 824. <b>Effects of Nitrate of Silver on Animals.</b>&mdash;Nitrate of silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[631]</a></span>
is changed into chloride by the animal fluids, and also forms a compound
with albumen. Silver chloride and silver albumenate are both
somewhat soluble in solutions containing chlorides of the alkalies, which
explains how a metallic salt, so very insoluble in water, can be absorbed
by the blood.</p>

<p>The action of soluble salts of silver on animals has been several times
investigated. There appears to be some difference between its effects on
warm and cold-blooded animals. In frogs there is quickly an exaltation
of the functions of the spinal cord, tetanic convulsions appear, similar to
those induced by strychnine; later, there is disturbance of the respiration
and cessation of voluntary motion.</p>

<p>The first symptoms with dogs and cats are vomiting and diarrh&#339;a;
muscular weakness, paralysis, disturbance of the respiration, and weak
clonic convulsions follow. Rouget, as well as Curci, considers that the
action of silver is directed to the central nervous system; there is first
excitement, and then follows paralysis of the centres of respiration and
movement. Death occurs through central asphyxia. According to the
researches of F. A. Falck, subcutaneous injections of silver nitrate into
rabbits cause a fall of temperature of 6&middot;7&deg; to 17&middot;6&deg;, the last being the
greatest fall which, in his numerous researches on the effect of poisons on
temperature, he has seen.</p>

<p>Chronic poisoning, according to the experiments of Bogoslowsky on
animals, produces emaciation, fatty degeneration of the liver, kidneys, and
also of the muscles&mdash;a statement confirmed by others.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_825" id="Sect_825"></a>&sect; 825. <b>Toxic Effects of Silver Nitrate in Man</b>&mdash;(1) <b>Acute Poisoning.</b>&mdash;This
is very rare. Orfila relates an attempt at suicide; but most
of the cases have been accidental, and of these, in recent times, about
five are recorded, mostly children. The accident is usually due to the
application of the solid nitrate to the throat, as an escharotic, the
stick breaking or becoming detached, and being immediately swallowed;
such an accident is related by Scattergood.<a name="FNanchor_901" id="FNanchor_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a> A piece of silver nitrate
<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inch long, slipped down the throat of a child, aged fifteen months&mdash;vomiting
immediately occurred, followed by convulsions and diarrh&#339;a;
chloride of sodium was administered, but the child died in six hours. In
other cases paralysis and an unconscious state has been observed.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>(2) <b>Chronic Poisoning.</b>&mdash;Salts of silver taken for a long period cause
a peculiar and indelible colour of the skin, the body becomes of a greyish-blue
to black colour, it begins first around the nails and fingers, then
patches of a similar hue appear in different parts of the body, and
gradually coalesce, being most marked in those parts exposed to the light.
The colour is not confined to the outer skin, but is also seen in the
mucous membranes. There is also a slight inflammation of the gums,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[632]</a></span>
and a violet line around their edge. Ginpon observed this line after two
months&#8217; treatment of a patient by silver nitrate; the whole quantity taken
being 3&middot;9 grms. (about 60 grains). The peculiar colour of the skin is
only seen after large dose; after 8 grms. taken in divided doses Chaillon
could not observe any change, but after 15 grms. had been taken it was
evident. So also Riemer has recorded a case, in which, after a year&#8217;s use
of silver nitrate (total quantity 17&middot;4 grms.) a greyish-black colour of the
face was produced, and, when nearly double the quantity had been taken,
the colour had invaded the whole body.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_826" id="Sect_826"></a>&sect; 826. <b>Post-mortem Appearances.</b>&mdash;In the acute case recorded by
Scattergood, the mucous membranes of the gullet, of the great curvature
of the stomach, and parts of the duodenum and jejunum were
eroded, and particles of curd-like silver chloride adhered to the mucous
membrane.</p>

<p>In the case recorded by Riemer of the long-continued use of silver
nitrate, the serous and mucous membranes were coloured dark; the
choroid plexus was of a blue-black; the endocardium, the valves of the
heart, and the aorta pale to dark grey, as well as the rest of the vessels;
the colouring was confined to the intima. The liver and kidney also
showed similar pigmentation. The pigment (probably metallic silver)
was in the form of very fine grains, and, as regards the skin, was situate
under the <i>rete Malpighia</i> in the upper layer of the corium, and also in
the deeper connective tissue and in the sweat glands. Liouville has
also found the kidneys of a woman similarly pigmented, who took silver
nitrate daily for 270 days, in all about 7 grms., five years before her
death.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_827" id="Sect_827"></a>&sect; 827. <b>Detection and Estimation of Silver.</b>&mdash;The examination of
the solid salts of silver usually met with (viz., the nitrate, bromide,
iodide, cyanide, and chloride) is most speedy by the dry method on
charcoal; in this way in less than 120 seconds any practical chemist
could identify each compound. The nitrate, bromide, iodide, and
cyanide, all, if ignited on charcoal, yield buttons of metallic silver&mdash;deflagration,
bromine vapours, iodine vapours, and cyanogen vapours
being the respective phenomena observed. Chloride of silver fuses to a
pearl-grey, brown, or black globule on charcoal, according to its purity;
but is only in the R.F. gradually reduced to metal. With soda, or fused
in hydrogen or coal gas, the reduction is rapid enough.</p>

<p><b>Nitrate of Silver in solution</b> might be identified by a very large
number of tests, since it forms so many insoluble salts. In practice one
is, however, satisfied with three tests, viz.: (1) A curdy precipitate of
chloride, on the addition of hydrochloric acid or alkaline chlorides, soluble
only in ammonia, cyanide of potassium, or hyposulphite of soda; (2) a
yellow precipitate, but little soluble in ammonia, on the addition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[633]</a></span>
iodide of potassium; and (3) a blood-red precipitate on the addition of
chromate of potash.</p>

<p>The separation of silver from the contents of the stomach is best
ensured by treating it with cyanide of potassium; for, unless a very large
quantity of silver nitrate has been taken, it is tolerably certain that the
whole of it has passed into chloride, and will, therefore, not be attacked
easily by acids. The contents of the stomach, then, or the tissues themselves,
are placed in a flask and warmed for some time with cyanide
of potassium, first, if necessary, adding ammonia. The fluid is separated
from the solid matters by subsidence (for an alkaline fluid of this kind
will scarcely filter), and then decomposed by hydrochloric acid in excess.
The flask containing this fluid is put on one side in a warm place, and
the clear fluid decanted from the insoluble chloride. The latter is now
collected on a filter, well washed with hot water, and then dried and
reduced on charcoal; or it may be put in a little porcelain crucible with
a rod of zinc and a few drops of hydrochloric acid. The silver is soon
deposited, and must be washed with water, then with sulphuric acid.
By the aid of a wash-bottle the particles of silver are now collected on a
small filter, again washed, and on the moist mass a crystal of nitrate of
potash and a little carbonate of soda laid. The whole is then dried, and
all the filter cut away, save the small portion containing the silver. This
small portion is now heated on charcoal until a little button of pure silver
is obtained, which may first be weighed, then dissolved in nitric acid,
and tested by the methods detailed.</p>

<p>In a similar way hair, suspected of being dyed with silver, can be
treated with chlorine gas, and the chloride dissolved in potassic cyanide.</p>

<p>Spots on linen, and, generally, very small quantities of silver, may be
detected by a simple galvanic process:&mdash;The substance is treated with
solution of cyanide of potassium, and submitted to a weak galvanic
current, using for the negative plate a slip of copper, for the positive,
platinum; the silver is deposited on the former.</p>

<p>When precipitated or deposited in a finely divided state, the metal can
be united into a single globule only if it is fairly pure; very slight <i>fatty</i>
impurities especially will prevent the union. It is insoluble in hydrochloric
acid, soluble to a slight extent in dilute cold sulphuric acid, and
completely soluble in concentrated sulphuric and in nitric acids. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[634]</a></span>

mercury in air, and thus oxidising the bismuth. Mercury may also contain
various mechanical impurities, which are detected by forcing the
metal by means of a vacuum pump through any dense filtering substance.
Tin and zinc may be dissolved out by hydrochloric acid, and all fixed

commercial samples often contain as little as 38 per cent.</p>

<p><b>Compound Mercury Ointment</b> (<b>Unguentum hydrargyri compositum</b>).&mdash;Made
with ointment of mercury, yellow wax, olive oil, and camphor;
it should contain 22&middot;2 per cent. Hg.</p>

<p><b>Liniment of Mercury</b> (<b>Linimentum hydrargyri</b>) is made of mercurial

about 16<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> per cent. of mercury.</p>

<p><b>Mercurial Suppositories</b> (<b>Suppositoria hydrargyri</b>).&mdash;Composed of
ointment of mercury and oil of theobroma. Each suppository should
weigh 15 grains and contain <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>3</sub> of its weight of mercurial ointment.</p>

<p><b>Acetate of Mercury</b> (<b>Mercurous acetate</b>) is not contained in the
B.P., but is officinal on the Continent. It is a salt occurring in white
micaceous scales, soluble in 133 parts of cold water, giving the reactions
of acetic acid and mercury, and very readily decomposed.</p>

<p><b>Mercuric Ethyl Chloride</b> (<b>Hydrargyrum &aelig;thylo-chloratum</b>) is used
as a medicine on the Continent. It occurs in white, glittering, crystalline
scales, which take on pressure a metallic appearance, and possess a
peculiar ethereal odour; it is but little soluble in water and ether, with
difficulty in cold alcohol, but copiously soluble on boiling, and depositing
crystals on cooling. It sublimes at about 40&deg; without residue; on quick
heating it burns with a weak flame, developing a vapour of metallic taste
and unpleasant odour. It gives no precipitate with silver nitrate, nor
with albumen.</p>

<p><b>Corrosive Sublimate</b> (<b>Mercuric chloride</b>), <span class="chemform">HgCl<sub>2</sub></span> = 271; Hg, 73&middot;8 per
cent., Cl, 26&middot;1 per cent.&mdash;In commerce this salt occurs in transparent,
heavy, colourless masses, which have a crystalline fracture; if placed in
the subliming cell described at <a href="#Page_258">p. 258</a>, it sublimes at about 82&middot;2&deg;
(180&deg; F.), and melts at higher temperatures. The sublimate is generally
in groups of plates drawn to a point at both ends, in crystalline needles,
or in octahedra with a rectangular base. It dissolves in 16 parts of cold
water and about 3 of boiling, and is very soluble in solutions of the
alkaline chlorides; it dissolves also in ether, and can be, to a great
extent, withdrawn from aqueous solutions by this agent. Alcohol
dissolves nearly one-third its weight of the salt, and its own weight
when boiling. It combines with albumen; gives, when in solution, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[636]</a></span>
precipitate of mercuric oxide when tested with solution of potash; a
white precipitate with ammonia; a scarlet with iodide of potassium; and
a black precipitate of finely divided mercury with protochloride of tin.
If a crystal (when placed in the subliming cell) gives a crystalline sublimate
at about the temperature mentioned, and this sublimate becomes
of a red colour when treated with a droplet of iodide of potassium, it can
be no other substance than corrosive sublimate.</p>

<p><b>Solution of Perchloride of Mercury</b> (<b>Liquor hydrargyri perchloridi</b>)

Hg, 92&middot;12 per cent.; specific gravity, 11 to 11&middot;3; small, red, shining,
crystalline scales, very insoluble in water, requiring about 20,000 parts;
entirely soluble in hydrochloric acid. By a heat below redness it may
be volatilised, and at the same time decomposed into mercury and
oxygen. Its principal impurity is nitric acid, readily detected by the
usual tests, or by heating in a test-tube, when, if nitric acid is present,
orange vapours will be evolved. Fixed red powders (such as brick-dust
and minium) are detected by being left as a residue, after the application
of heat sufficient to volatilise the mercury. An ointment (strength 1&nbsp;: 8)
is officinal.</p>

<p><b>Sulphate of Mercury.</b>&mdash;A white crystalline powder, decomposed by

<span class="chemform">HgSO<sub>4</sub>2HgO</span>; Hg, 82&middot;4 per cent.; specific gravity, 8&middot;319. It
requires for solution 2000 parts of cold, and 600 of boiling water; but
dissolves with tolerable ease in hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p><b>The Sulphide of Mercury</b>, known in commerce under the name of
<i>Ethiops mineral</i>, is officinal in France, the Netherlands, and Germany. Its
properties have been already described. The German and Dutch pharmacop&#339;ias
require in it 50, the French only 33<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>3</sub> per cent. of metallic mercury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[638]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Hahnemann&#8217;s Soluble Mercury</b> (<b>Hydrargyrum solubile Hahnemanni</b>)

be in the proportion of 86&middot;33 per cent., the ammonia 2&middot;44 per cent.</p>

<p><b>Crystallised Nitrate of Mercury</b> (<b>Hydrargyrum nitricum oxidulatum</b>)
is officinal in the pharmacop&#339;ias of Germany, Switzerland, and
France. The salt is in white crystals, giving the reactions of nitric acid
and mercury, decomposed by the addition of water, but fully soluble in
water, if first moistened with nitric acid. The formula of the neutral salt
is <span class="chemform">Hg2NO<sub>3</sub>HgO2H<sub>2</sub>O</span>, which requires 69&middot;4 per cent. of mercury. An acid
solution of mercuric nitrate is officinal.</p>

<p><b>An Ointment of Nitrate of Mercury</b> (<b>Unguentum hydrargyri

<p><b>Cyanide of Mercury</b>, <span class="chemform">HgCy</span>, is contained in the French pharmacop&#339;ia.
It occurs in small, colourless, prismatic crystals, easily soluble in water.
If to the solution chloride of tin be added, a black precipitate of reduced
metal and stannous oxide is thrown down, and the odour of prussic acid
is developed.</p>

<p><b>Mercuric Sulphide</b> (<b>Sulphide of Mercury</b>, <b>Cinnabar</b>, <b>Vermilion</b>) is
officinal in Germany, the Netherlands, and France; <span class="chemform">HgS</span> = 232; specific
gravity, solid, 8&middot;2; Hg, 86&middot;21 per cent., O, 13&middot;79 per cent. For medicinal
purposes it is made artificially. It is a beautiful red powder, insoluble in
all alkaline and all acid liquids, with the exception of aqua regia. The
solution gives the reactions of a sulphide and mercury. On heating, it
must burn away entirely without residue; adulterations or impurities are&mdash;minium,
lead, copper, and other metals. The detection of minium is
conveniently executed in the dry way. Pure cinnabar, when heated in a
matrass, gives a black sublimate, which becomes red on friction. If
minium is present, sulphide of lead remains as a residue, and may be
recognised on coal; the same remark applies to sulphide of antimony.
If it be desired to take the percentage of mercury in cinnabar, equal
parts of oxalate and cyanide of potassium should be well mixed with
the cinnabar, and heated in the bent tube described at <a href="#Page_654">p. 654</a>; by this

existed as to the precise quantity. Sometimes, also, there is probably a
chemical change in the substance, so that it is impossible to state the
fatal dose. For example, it is well known that calomel, under the influence
of alkaline chlorides, can be converted into the bichloride&mdash;a fact
which probably explains the extensive corrosive lesions that have been
found after death from large doses of calomel.</p>

<p>The effects of the different compounds of mercury may be divided into
two groups, viz., (1) Those caused by the finely divided metal and the
non-corrosive compounds; (2) the effects caused by the corrosive compounds.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_836" id="Sect_836"></a>&sect; 836. (1) Effects of Mercurial Vapour, and of the Non-Corrosive
Compounds of Mercury.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <b>Vegetable Life.</b>&mdash;Priestly and Boussingault have shown that
plants under a glass shade in which mercury is exposed in a saucer, first
exhibit black spots on the leaves; ultimately, the latter blacken entirely,
and the plants die.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <b>Animal Life.</b>&mdash;Mercury in the form of vapour is fatal to animal
life, but it is only so by repeated and intense application. Eulenberg<a name="FNanchor_914" id="FNanchor_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a>
placed a rabbit under a large glass shade, and for four days exposed it
daily for two hours to the volatilisation of 2 grms. of mercury on warm
sand; on the sixth and seventh day 1&middot;5 grm. was volatilised. On the
fifteenth day there was no apparent change in the aspect of the animal;
5 grms. of mercury were then heated in a retort, and the vapour blown
in at intervals of ten minutes. Fourteen days afterwards the gums were
reddened and swollen, and the appetite lost; the conjunctiv&aelig; were also
somewhat inflamed. The following day these symptoms disappeared,
and the animal remained well.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_914" id="Footnote_914"></a><a href="#FNanchor_914"><span class="label">[914]</span></a> <i>Op. cit.</i>, p. 728.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>In another experiment 20 grms. of mercury were volatilised, and a
rabbit exposed to the vapour under a small glass shade. The following
day the conjunctiv&aelig; were moist and reddened; two days afterwards 10
grms. of mercury were volatilised in the same way; and in two days&#8217;
interval other 10 grms. were volatilised in three-quarters of an hour.
There was no striking change noticeable in the condition of the animal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">[642]</a></span>
but within forty-eight hours it was found dead. The cause of death
proved to be an extravasation of blood at the base of the brain. The
bronchia were reddened throughout, and the lungs congested. Mercury,
as with man, is also readily absorbed by the broken or unbroken skin;
hence thousands of sheep have been poisoned by the excessive and
ignorant external application of mercurial ointment as a remedy against
the attacks of parasites. The sheep become emaciated, refuse food, and
seem to be in pain, breathing with short quick gasps.</p>

<p>In experiments on rabbits, dogs, and warm-blooded animals generally,
salivation and stomatitis are found to occur as regularly as in man; so
also in animals and man, paralytic and other nervous affections have
been recorded.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_837" id="Sect_837"></a>&sect; 837. (<i>c</i>) <b>Effects on Man.</b>&mdash;In 1810<a name="FNanchor_915" id="FNanchor_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a> an extraordinary accident produced,
perhaps, the largest wholesale poisoning by mercurial vapour on
record. The account of this is as follows:&mdash;H.M.S. &#8220;Triumph,&#8221; of seventy-four
guns, arrived in the harbour of Cadiz in the month of February
1810; and in the following March, a Spanish vessel, laden with mercury
for the South American mines, having been driven on shore in a gale,
was wrecked. The &#8220;Triumph&#8221; saved by her boats 130 tons of the
mercury, and this was stowed on board. The mercury was first confined
in bladders, the bladders again were enclosed in small barrels, and the
barrels in boxes. The heat of the weather, however, was at this time
considerable; and the bladders, having been wetted in the removal
from the wreck, soon rotted, and mercury, to the amount of several tons,
was speedily diffused as vapour through the ship, mixing more or less with
the bread and the other provisions. In three weeks 200 men were
affected with ptyalism, ulceration of the mouth, partial paralysis, and, in
many instances, with diarrh&#339;a. The &#8220;Triumph&#8221; was now ordered to
Gibraltar, the provisions were removed, and efforts were made to cleanse
the vessel. On restowing the hold, every man so employed was salivated.
The effects noted were not confined to the officers and ship&#8217;s company, for
almost all the stock died from the fumes&mdash;mice, cats, a dog, and even a
canary bird shared the same fate, though the food of the latter was kept
in a bottle closely corked up. The vapour was very deleterious to those
having any tendency to pulmonic affections. Three men, who had never
complained before they were saturated with mercury, died of phthisis;
one, who had not had any pulmonic complaint, was left behind at
Gibraltar, where his illness developed into a confirmed phthisis. Two
died from gangrene of the cheeks and tongue. A woman, confined to
bed with a fractured limb, lost two of her teeth; and many exfoliations
of the jaw took place.</p>

<p>Accidents from the vapour of mercury, quite independently of its
applications in the arts, have also occurred, some of them under curious
circumstances; such, for example, is the case mentioned in the <a href="#Footnote_908">footnote</a>
to p. 639. Witness, again, a case mentioned by Seidel,<a name="FNanchor_916" id="FNanchor_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a> in which a

other 2&middot;5 grms. of mercury poured on red-hot coals, and died in ten days
with all the symptoms of mercurial poisoning.</p>

<p>The metal taken in bulk into the stomach has been considered non-poisonous,
and, probably, when perfectly pure, it is so; we have,
however, the case of a girl who swallowed 4<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> ozs. by weight of the liquid
metal, for the purpose of procuring abortion&mdash;this it did not effect; but,
in a few days, she suffered from a trembling and shaking of the body and
loss of muscular power. These symptoms continued for two months,
but there was no salivation and no blue marks on the gums. This case
is a rare one, and a pound or more has been taken without injury.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_838" id="Sect_838"></a>&sect; 838. <b>Absorption of Mercury by the Skin.</b>&mdash;Mercury in a finely
divided form, rubbed into the skin, is absorbed, and all the effects of
mercurialism result. This method of administering mercury for medicinal
purposes has long been in use, but, when the inunction is excessive,
death may occur. Thus, Leiblinger records a case in which three persons
were found dead in bed; the day before they had rubbed into the body,
for the purpose of curing the itch, a salve containing 270 grms. of
mercury finely divided.</p>

<p>It is difficult to say in what proportion workers in mercury, such as
water-gilders, &amp;c., suffer. According to Hirt, not only do 1&middot;5 to 2&middot;1 per
cent. of the workmen employed in smelting mercury ores suffer acutely,
but as high a proportion as 8&middot;7 per cent. are slightly affected.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_839" id="Sect_839"></a>&sect; 839. <b>Symptoms of Poisoning by Mercury Vapour.</b>&mdash;The symptoms
of poisoning by mercury vapour, or by the finely divided metal, are the
same as those which arise from the corrosive salts, with the exception of
the local action. In mild cases there is pallor, languor, and sore mouth
(from slightly inflamed gums), f&#339;tid breath, and disorder of the digestive
organs. If the action is more intense, there is an inflammation of the
gums and, indeed, of the whole mouth, and salivation, which is sometimes
so profuse that as much as two gallons of saliva have been
secreted daily. The saliva is alkaline, has a bad odour, and its specific
gravity in the early stages is increased, but ultimately becomes normal;
the gums are raised into slight swellings, which gradually enlarge and
coalesce. The teeth that are already carious, decay more rapidly; they
become loose, and some may be shed; the inflammatory action may
extend to the jaw, and necrosis of portions of the bone is no unusual
occurrence. On recovery, the cheeks sometimes form adhesions with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">[644]</a></span>
gums, and cicatrices always mark the loss of substance which such an
affection entails. With the stomatitis there are disturbances of the
gastro-intestinal tract&mdash;nausea and vomiting, pain in the stomach, and
diarrh&#339;a alternating with constipation. Conjunctivitis is very common,
both in man and animals, from exposure to mercury vapours. The
further action of the metal is shown in its profound effects on the
nervous system. The patient is changed in his disposition, he is excitable,
nervous, or torpid; there are sleeplessness and bad dreams, at the
same time headache, noises in the ears, giddiness, faintings, &amp;c.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_840" id="Sect_840"></a>&sect; 840. <b>Mercurial Tremor.</b>&mdash;Mercurial tremor<a name="FNanchor_917" id="FNanchor_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a> may follow, or accompany
the above state, or it may be the chief and most prominent effect.
It specially affects the arms, partly withdrawing the muscles from the
control of the will, so that a person affected with mercurial tremor is
incapacitated for following any occupation, especially those requiring a
delicate and steady touch. In cases seriously affected, the tremor spreads
gradually to the feet and legs, and finally the whole body may be invaded.
The patient is no longer master of his muscles&mdash;the muscular system is
in anarchy, each muscle aimlessly contracting and relaxing independently
of the rest&mdash;the movement of the legs becomes uncertain, the speech
stuttering, the facial expressions are even distorted into grimaces, and
the sufferer sinks into a piteous state of helplessness. The convulsive
movements generally cease during sleep. The tremors are accompanied
by interference with the functions of other organs: the respiration is
weakened and difficult; dyspn&#339;a, or an asthmatic condition, results; the
pulse is small and slow; paresis, deepening into paralysis of the extremities,
or of a group of muscles, follows; and, lastly, if the condition is not
alleviated, the patient becomes much emaciated and sinks from exhaustion.
Pregnant women are liable to abortion, and the living infants of
women suffering from tremor have also exhibited tremor of the limbs.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_917" id="Footnote_917"></a><a href="#FNanchor_917"><span class="label">[917]</span></a> A case of mercurial tremor (in <i>Bericht. des K. K. Allgem.
Krankenhauses zu Wien im Jahre 1872</i>, Wien, 1873) is interesting, as
showing the influence of pregnancy. A woman, twenty years of age,
employed in making barometers, had, in 1869, mercurial tremor and
salivation. During a three months&#8217; pregnancy the tremor ceased, but
again appeared after she had aborted. She again became pregnant, and the
tremor ceased until after her confinement in November 1871. The tremor
was so violent that the patient could not walk; she also had stomatitis;
but ultimately, by treatment with galvanism and other remedies, she
recovered.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>In the case of the &#8220;mass poisoning&#8221; on board the &#8220;Triumph,&#8221; it has
been mentioned that several of the sailors became consumptive, and the
same effect has been noticed among all workers in the metal; it is now,
indeed, an accepted fact that the cachexia induced by mercurialismus
produces a weak habit of body specially liable to the tuberculous
infection.</p>

<p>The course of the poisoning is generally more rapid when it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">[645]</a></span>
resulted from the taking of mercury internally as a medicine than when
inhaled by workers in the metal, <i>e.g.</i>, a patient suffering from mercurial
tremor shown to the Medical Society by Mr. Spencer Watson in 1872,
had resisted for seven years the influence of the fumes of mercury; and
then succumbed, exhibiting the usual symptoms. Idiosyncrasy plays a
considerable <i>r&ocirc;le</i>; some persons (and especially those whose kidneys are
diseased) bear small doses of mercury ill, and are readily salivated or
affected; this is evidently due to imperfect elimination.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_841" id="Sect_841"></a>&sect; 841. <b>Mercuric Methide</b>, <span class="chemform">Hg(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub></span>.&mdash;This compound is obtained by
the action of methyl iodide on sodium amalgam in the presence of acetic
ether. It is a dense, stable liquid, of highly poisonous properties. In
1865, mercuric methide, in course of preparation in a London laboratory,
caused two cases of very serious slow poisoning.<a name="FNanchor_918" id="FNanchor_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a> One was that of a
German, aged 30, who was engaged in preparing this compound for
three months, and during this time his sight and hearing became impaired;
he was very weak, his gums were sore, and he was ultimately
admitted into St. Bartholomew&#8217;s Hospital, February 3rd, 1865. His
urine was found to be albuminous, and his mental faculties very torpid.
On the 9th he became noisy, and had to be put under mechanical
restraint. On the 10th he was semi-comatose, but there was no paralysis;
his breath was very offensive, his pupils dilated; at intervals he
raised himself and uttered incoherent howls. There was neither sensation
nor motion in the left leg, which was extended rigidly; the knee
and the foot were turned slightly inward. On the 14th he died
insensible.</p>

<p>The only appearance of note seen at the autopsy was a congestion of
the grey matter in the brain; the kidneys and liver were also congested,
and there were ecchymoses in the kidneys.</p>

<p>The second case&mdash;a young man, aged 23, working in the same laboratory&mdash;was
admitted into the hospital, March 28th, 1865. In the previous
January he had been exposed to the vapour of mercuric methide
for about a fortnight; during the illness of the other assistant he felt ill
and weak, and complained of soreness of the gums and looseness of the
teeth. He had also dimness of vision, pain and redness of the eyes,
giddiness, nausea and vomiting, the ejected matters being greenish and
watery. At the beginning of March his sight and taste became imperfect&mdash;all
things tasted alike; his tongue was numb and his gums sore, he
was also salivated slightly. A week before admission he lost his hearing,
and first his hands and then his feet became numb; on admission his
breath was very offensive, his pupils dilated; the sight impaired; he was
very deaf, and his powers of speech, taste, and smell were deficient.
There was an&aelig;sthesia of the body, and the movement of the limbs was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[646]</a></span>
sluggish and difficult. He continued in the hospital for nearly a month,
with but little change. On April 24th, it was noticed that he was getting
thinner and slightly jaundiced; he moved his arms aimlessly in an
idiotic manner, and passed his urine involuntarily. On April 27th he
was more restless, and even violent, shrieking out and making a loud,
incoherent noise, or laughing foolishly; he passed his motions and urine
beneath him. On July 7th he was in a similar state&mdash;perfectly idiotic.
He died on April 7th, 1866, about a year and three months from his first
exposure to the vapour; the immediate cause of death was pneumonia.
The <i>post-mortem</i> appearances of the brain and membranes differed little
from the normal state; the grey matter was pink, but otherwise healthy;
there was a considerable amount of cerebro-spinal fluid; the arachnoid
along the longitudinal fissure was thickened; the total weight of the
brain with medulla was 41 ozs. The stomach was of enormous size; the
pyramids of the kidneys were congested, as was also the small intestine;
the lungs showed the usual signs of pneumonia.<a name="FNanchor_919" id="FNanchor_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a></p>

in large doses.<a name="FNanchor_920" id="FNanchor_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a> If the poison has been swallowed, the symptoms come
on almost immediately, and always within the first half hour; the whole
duration also is rapid. In 36 cases collected by F. A. Falck, 11 died on

<p>In the very act of swallowing, a strong metallic taste and a painful
sensation of constriction in the throat are experienced. There is a burning
heat in the throat extending downwards to the stomach. All the
mucous membranes with which the solution comes in contact are attacked,
shrivelled, and whitened; so that, on looking into the mouth, the appearance
has been described as similar to that produced by the recent application
of silver nitrate. The local changes may be so intense as to cause
&#339;dema of the glottis, and death through asphyxia. In a few minutes
violent pain is felt in the stomach; so much so, that the sufferer is
drawn together, and is in a fainting condition; but there are rare cases
in which pain has been absent. There are nausea and vomiting, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[647]</a></span>

vomiting usually throws off some of the poison, if it has been swallowed;
and the best treatment seems to be, to give copious albuminous
drinks, such, for example, as the whites of eggs in water, milk, and the
like. The vomiting may be encouraged by subcutaneous injections of
apomorphine. The after-treatment should be directed to eliminating the
poison, which is most safely effected by very copious drinks of distilled
water (see &#8220;<a href="#Page_685">Appendix</a>&#8221;).</p>

<p>The treatment of slow poisoning is mainly symptomatic; medicinal
doses of zinc phosphide seem to have done good in mercurial tremors.
Potassic iodide is also supposed to assist the elimination of mercury.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_849" id="Sect_849"></a>&sect; 849. <b>Post-mortem Appearances.</b>&mdash;The pathological effects seen after
chronic poisoning are too various to be distinctive. In the museum of the
Royal College of Surgeons there is (No. 2559) the portion of a colon derived
from a lady aged 74.<a name="FNanchor_932" id="FNanchor_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a> This lady had been accustomed for forty-three
years to take a grain of calomel every night; for many years she did not
suffer in health, but ultimately she became emaciated and cachectic, with
anasarca and albuminuria. The kidneys were found to be granular, and
the mucous membrane of a great part of the intestine of a remarkable
black colour, mottled with patches of a lighter hue, presenting somewhat
the appearance of a toad&#8217;s back. From the portion of colon preserved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">[649]</a></span>
mercury was readily obtained by means of Reinsch&#8217;s test. The black
deposit is in the submucosa, and it is, without doubt, mercurial, and probably
mercury sulphide. In acute poisoning (especially by the corrosive
salts) the changes are great and striking. After rapid death from corrosive
sublimate, the escharotic whitening of the mouth, throat, and gullet,
already described, will be seen. The mucous membrane right throughout,
from mouth to anus, is more or less affected and destroyed, according
to the dose and concentration of the poison. The usual appearances in
the stomach are those of intense congestion, with ecchymoses, and portions
of it may be destroyed. Sometimes the coats are very much
blackened; this is probably due to a coating of sulphide of mercury.</p>

<p>In St. George&#8217;s Hospital Museum, there are (from a patient dying in the hospital)
preparations which well illustrate what pathological changes may be expected in
any case surviving for a few days. The patient was Francis L&mdash;&mdash;, aged 45, admitted
to the hospital, February 27, 1842. He took a quantity of corrosive sublimate spread
on bread and butter, was immediately sick, and was unable to take as much as he
had intended. The stomach-pump and other remedies were used. On the following
day his mouth was sore, and on March 1st his vision was dim; his mouth was
drawn over to the right side, and he lost power over the left eyelid, but he had
no pain; he passed some blood from the bowel. On the 2nd he passed much
blood, and was salivated; still no pain. On March 4, on the evening of the
sixth day, he expired; he was drowsy during the last day, and passed watery
evacuations.</p>

of the tonsils, and fibrinous exudation on the gullet. The stomach (43b, 199)
shows a large dark slough, three inches from the cardiac extremity; the margin surrounding
the slough is thickened, ulcerated, and irregular in shape, the submucous
tissue, to some extent, being also thickened; there is fibrine in the ileum, pharynx,

in the few cases which have been recorded, there has been intense

<p>This case is of considerable interest, for there are recorded in toxicological
treatises a few cases of undoubted mercurial poisoning in which no
poison had been detected, although there was ample evidence that it had
been administered by the mouth. In such cases, it is probable that the
whole length of the intestinal canal had not been examined, and the
analysis failed from this cause. When (as not unfrequently happens)
the mercurial poison has entered by the skin, it is evident that the most
likely localities are the urine, the liver, and the kidneys.<a name="FNanchor_940" id="FNanchor_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a></p>

<p><a name="Sect_852" id="Sect_852"></a>&sect; 852. <b>Tests for Mercury.</b>&mdash;Mercury, in combination and in the solid
form, is most readily detected by mixing the substance intimately with
dry anhydrous sodic carbonate, transferring the mixture to a glass tube,
sealed at one end, and applying heat. If mercury be present, a ring of
minute globules condenses in the cool part of the tube. If the quantity
of mercury is likely to be very minute, it is best to modify the process by
using a subliming cell (<a href="#Page_258">p. 258</a>), and thus obtain the sublimate on a circle
of thin glass in a convenient form for microscopical examination. If
there is any doubt whether the globules are those of mercury or not, this
may be resolved by putting a fragment of iodine on the lower disc of the
subliming cell, and then completing it by the disc which contains the
sublimate (of course, the supposed mercurial surface must be undermost);
on placing the cell in a warm, light place, after a time the scarlet iodide
is formed, and the identification is complete. Similarly, a glass tube containing
an ill-defined metallic ring of mercury can be sealed or corked up
with a crystal of iodine, and, after a few hours, the yellow iodide, changing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">[652]</a></span>
to scarlet, will become apparent. There are few (if any) tests of
greater delicacy than this.</p>

<p>Mercury in solution can be withdrawn by acidulating the liquid, and
then inserting either simply a piece of gold foil, gold wire, or bright
copper foil; or else, by a galvanic arrangement, such as iron wire wound
round a gold coin, or gold foil attached to a rod of zinc; or, lastly, by the
aid of gold or copper electrodes in connection with a battery. By any of
these methods, mercury is obtained in the metallic state, and the metal
with its film can be placed in a subliming cell, and globules deposited and
identified, as before described.</p>

<p>The <b>Precipitating Reagents</b> for mercury are numerous: a solution of
stannous chloride, heated with a solution of mercury, or any combination,
whether soluble or insoluble, reduces it to the metallic state.</p>

<p><b>Mercurous Salts</b> in solution yield, with potash, soda, or lime, a black
precipitate of mercurous oxide. <b>Mercuric Salts</b>, a bright yellow precipitate
of mercuric oxide.</p>

<p><b>Mercurous Salts</b> yield black precipitates, with sulphides of ammonium
and hydrogen. <b>Mercuric Salts</b> give a similar reaction, but, with sulphuretted
hydrogen, first a whitish precipitate, passing slowly through
red to black.</p>

<p><b>Mercurous Salts</b>, with solutions of the chlorides, give a white precipitate
of calomel; the <b>Mercuric Salts</b> yield no precipitate under similar
circumstances. <b>Mercurous Salts</b>, treated with iodide of potassium, give
a green mercurous iodide; <b>Mercuric</b>, a scarlet.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_853" id="Sect_853"></a>&sect; 853. <b>The Detection of Mercury in Organic Substances and Fluids.</b>&mdash;Ludwig&#8217;s
process, previously described, is found in practice the best.
Fluids, such as urine, must be evaporated to dryness, and then treated
with hydrochloric acid. Such organs as the liver are cut up and boiled
in 20 per cent. <span class="chemform">HCl</span>. Distinct evidence of mercury in the liver has been
obtained on a piece of copper gauze, in a case where a child had been
given 2 grains of calomel before death. &#8220;Four ounces of the liver were
treated with hydrochloric acid and water, and a small piece of pure
copper placed in the acid liquid while warm, and kept there for about
forty-eight hours. It acquired a slight silvery lustre, and globules of
mercury were obtained from it by sublimation.&#8221;</p>

<p>To detect the cyanide of mercury may require special treatment, and
Vitali<a name="FNanchor_943" id="FNanchor_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a> recommends the following process:&mdash;The fluid is acidified with
tartaric acid and neutralised by freshly precipitated <span class="chemform">CaCO<sub>3</sub></span>; a slight excess
of hydric sulphide is added, and the flask allowed to rest for twenty-four
hours in the cold. Then a further quantity of <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span> is added, and a
current of hydrogen passed through the liquid; the effluent gas is first
made to bubble through a solution of bismuth nitrate in dilute nitric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">[653]</a></span>
acid (for the purpose of absorbing <span class="chemform">SH<sub>2</sub></span>), and then through aqueous potash
(to absorb <span class="chemform">HCl</span>); in the first flask the analyst will separate and identify
mercury sulphide, while in the last flask there will be potassic cyanide,
which will respond to the usual tests.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>In those cases where no special search is made for mercury, but an
acid (hydrochloric) solution is treated with sulphuretted hydrogen,
mercury is indicated by the presence of a black precipitate, which does
not dissolve in warm nitric acid.</p>

<p>The further treatment of the black sulphide may be undertaken in two
ways:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1) It is collected on a porcelain dish, with the addition of a little
nitric acid, and evaporated to dryness in order to destroy organic matter.
Hydrochloric and a few drops of nitric acid are next added; the action is
aided by a gentle heat, the solution finally evaporated to dryness on the
water-bath, and the residue taken up by warm distilled water. The
solution is that of a persalt of mercury, and the mercury can be separated
by electrolysis, or indicated by the tests already detailed.</p>

<p>(2) The other method, and the most satisfactory, is to mix the sulphide
while moist with dry carbonate of soda, make it into a pellet which
will easily enter a reducing or subliming tube, dry it carefully, and obtain
a sublimate of metallic mercury.</p>

<p>A neat method of recognising mercury when deposited as a film on
copper has been proposed by E. Brugnatelli:<a name="FNanchor_944" id="FNanchor_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a> the copper, after being
washed, is transferred to a glass vessel, and a porcelain lid, on which a
drop of gold chloride solution has been placed, adjusted over the dish.
The whole is heated by a water-bath. The mercury vapour reduces the
gold chloride, and gold is deposited as a bluish-violet stain; <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub> mgrm.
mercury may by this test be identified.</p>

<p>Of special methods for the separation and detection of mercury,
Ludwig&#8217;s<a name="FNanchor_945" id="FNanchor_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a> is, without a doubt, the best when organic matters have to
be dealt with; the finely divided solid substances are boiled for some hours
with hydrochloric acid, strength 20 per cent.; then the liquid is cooled to
60&deg;, and potassic chlorate added in half gramme quantities until the dark
liquid becomes clear; the liquid is cooled and filtered, and the substances
on the filter washed with water. To the filtrate 5 grms. of zinc dust are
added, and the liquid is violently shaken from time to time; a second
portion is afterwards added, and also vigorously shaken. After some
hours the clear liquid is separated from the zinc and the zinc washed,
first with water, then with a little soda solution, and finally, again with
water. The zinc is now collected on a glass-wool filter, treated with
absolute alcohol to remove water, and dried by suction in a stream of air.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">[654]</a></span>
The zinc is put into a combustion-tube, the tube being drawn out into a
thin capillary extremity, and a combustion made, the mercury collecting
at the capillary part. It is a necessary refinement, should the zinc be
contaminated with a trace of organic matter, to pack the combustion-tube
as follows:&mdash;First, the zinc dust on which any mercury present has been
deposited, then a plug of asbestos; next, some cupric oxide; and lastly,
some pure zinc dust. Bondzynski<a name="FNanchor_946" id="FNanchor_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a> prefers to use copper rather than
zinc; for he says that zinc so frequently contains cadmium, which latter
metal also gives a mirror, so that, unless the mercury is afterwards
identified by turning it into an iodide, error may be caused.</p>

containing mercury, as well as the sulphide prepared in the wet way,
and minerals, are best dealt with by obtaining and weighing the metal
in the solid state. The assay is very simple and easy when carried out
on the method that was first, perhaps, proposed by Domeyko. A glass
tube (which should not be too thin), closed at one end, is bent, as shown
in the <a href="#Fig689">figure</a>, the diameter should be about three lines, the length from 7 to
8 inches, the shorter arm not exceeding 2 inches. The powdered substance
is mixed with two or three times its weight of litharge, and introduced
into the tube at <i>a</i>. The portion of the tube containing the
mercury is at first heated gently, but finally brought to a temperature
sufficient to fuse the substance and soften the glass. The mercury
collects in an annular film at <i>b</i> in the cooler limb, and may now, with a
little management of the lamp, be concentrated in a well-defined ring;
the portion of the tube containing this ring is cut off, weighed, then
cleansed from mercury, and reweighed. Many of the pharmaceutical
preparations do not require litharge, which is specially adapted for ores,
and heating with sodic carbonate (in great excess) will suffice. Mercury
mixed with organic matter must be first separated as described, by copper
or gold, the silvered foil rolled up, dried, introduced into the bent tube,
and simply heated without admixture with any substance; the weight
may be obtained either by weighing the foil before and after the operation,
or as above.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_855" id="Sect_855"></a>&sect; 855. <b>Volumetric Processes for the Estimation of Mercury.</b>&mdash;When
a great number of mercurial preparations are to be examined, a
volumetric process is extremely convenient. There are several of these
processes, some adapted more particularly for mercuric, and others for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">[655]</a></span>
mercurous compounds. For mercuric, the method of Personne<a name="FNanchor_947" id="FNanchor_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a> is the
best. The conversion of the various forms of mercury into corrosive
sublimate may be effected by evaporation with aqua regia, care being
taken that the bath shall not be at a boiling temperature, or there will
be a slight loss.</p>

<p>Personne prefers to heat with caustic soda or potash, and then pass
chlorine gas into the mixture; the excess of chlorine is expelled by
boiling, mercuric chloride in presence of an alkaline chloride not being
volatilised at 100&deg;. The standard solutions required for this process are:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1)  33&middot;2 grms. of potassic iodide in 1 litre of water, 1 c.c. = 0&middot;01 grm.
Hg, or 0&middot;01355 grm. <span class="chemform">HgCl<sub>2</sub></span>.</p>

<p>(2)  A solution of mercuric chloride containing 13&middot;55 grms. to the litre,
1 c.c. = 0&middot;1 grm. Hg.</p>

<p>The process is founded on the fact that, if a solution of mercuric
chloride be added to one of potassic iodide, in the proportion of one of the
former to four of the latter, mercuric iodide is formed, and immediately
dissolved, until the balance is overstepped, when the red colour is
developed; the final reaction is very sharp, and with solutions properly
made is very accurate. The mercuric solution must always be added to
the alkaline iodide; a reversal of the process does not answer. It therefore
follows that the solution to be tested must be made up to a definite
bulk, and added to a known quantity of the potassic iodide until the
red colour appears.</p>

<p><b>Mercurous Salts</b> may be titrated with great accuracy by a decinormal
solution of sodic chloride. This is added to the cold solution in very
slight excess, the calomel filtered off, the filtrate neutralised by pure
carbonate of soda, and the amount of sodic chloride still unused found by
titration with nitrate of silver, the end reaction being indicated by chromate
of potash. Several other volumetric processes are fully described in
works treating upon this branch of analysis.</p>

<h4>1. ZINC.</h4>

<p><a name="Sect_856" id="Sect_856"></a>&sect; 856. <b>Zinc</b>&mdash;At. wt., 65; specific gravity, 6&middot;8 to 7&middot;1; fusing-point,
412&deg; (773&deg; F.)&mdash;is a hard, bluish-white, brittle metal, with a crystalline
fracture. Between 100&deg; and 150&deg; it becomes ductile, and may be easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">[656]</a></span>
wrought, but at a little higher temperature it again becomes brittle, and
at a bright red heat it fuses, and then volatilises, the fumes taking fire
when exposed to the air. In analysis, zinc occurs either as a metallic
deposit on a platinum foil or dish, or as a brittle bead, obtained by
reducing a zinc compound with soda on charcoal.</p>

<p>The salts of zinc to be briefly described here are the carbonate, the
oxide, and the sulphide,&mdash;all of which are likely to occur in the separation
and estimation of zinc, and the sulphate and chloride,&mdash;salts more
especially found in commerce, and causing accidents from time to time.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_857" id="Sect_857"></a>&sect; 857. <b>Carbonate of Zinc</b>, in the native form of calamine, contains, as
is well known, 64&middot;8 per cent. of oxide of zinc; but the carbonate obtained
in the course of an analysis by precipitating the neutral hot solution of
a soluble salt of zinc by carbonate of potash or soda, is carbonate of zinc
<i>plus</i> a variable quantity of hydrated oxide of zinc. Unless the precipitation
takes place at a boiling temperature, the carbonic anhydride retains
a portion of the oxide of zinc in solution. By ignition of the carbonate,
oxide of zinc results.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_858" id="Sect_858"></a>&sect; 858. <b>Oxide of Zinc</b> (<span class="chemform">ZnO</span> = 81; specific gravity, 5&middot;612; Zn, 80&middot;24,
O, 19&middot;76) is a white powder when cool, yellow when hot. If mixed with
sufficient powdered sulphur, and ignited in a stream of hydrogen, the
sulphide is produced; if ignited in the pure state in a rapid stream of
hydrogen gas, metallic zinc is obtained; but, if it is only a feeble current,
the oxide of zinc becomes crystalline, a portion only being reduced.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_859" id="Sect_859"></a>&sect; 859. <b>Sulphide of Zinc</b> (<span class="chemform">ZnS</span> = 97; specific gravity, 4&middot;1; Zn, 67&middot;01,
S, 32&middot;99).&mdash;The sulphide obtained by treating a neutral solution of a
soluble salt of zinc by hydric sulphide is hydrated sulphide, insoluble in
water, caustic alkalies, and alkaline sulphides, but dissolving completely
in nitric or in hydrochloric acid. When dry, it is a white powder, and
if ignited contains some oxide of zinc. The anhydrous sulphide is produced
by mixing the precipitated sulphide with sulphur, and igniting in
a crucible in a stream of hydrogen gas.</p>

<p><b>Pharmaceutical Preparations.</b>&mdash;The officinal compounds of zinc used
in medicine are the <i>acetate</i>, <i>carbonate</i>, <i>chloride</i>, <i>oxide</i>, <i>sulphate</i>, <i>sulphocarbolate</i>,
and <i>valerianate</i>.</p>

<p><b>Sulphate of Zinc</b> (<span class="chemform">ZnSO<sub>4</sub>7H<sub>2</sub>O</span> 161 + 126; specific gravity, crystals,
1&middot;931).&mdash;This salt is officinal in all the pharmacop&#339;ias, is used in calico-printing,
and is commonly known as <i>white vitriol</i>. By varying the temperature
at which the crystals are allowed to be formed, it may be obtained
with 6, 5, 2, or 1 atoms of water. The commercial sulphate is in crystals
exactly similar to those of Epsom salts; it is slightly efflorescent, and
gives the reactions of zinc and sulphuric acid.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_860" id="Sect_860"></a>&sect; 860. <b>Chloride of Zinc</b> is obtained by dissolving zinc in hydrochloric
acid, or by direct union of zinc and chlorine. Chloride of zinc is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">[657]</a></span>
only constituent in the well-known &#8220;Burnett&#8217;s disinfectant fluid.&#8221; A
solution of chloride of zinc may be heated until it becomes water-free;
when this takes place it still remains fluid, and makes a convenient bath,
for warmth may be applied to it above 370&deg; without its emitting fumes
to inconvenience; at a red heat it distils. A concentrated solution of
zinco-ammonic chloride (<span class="chemform">2H<sub>4</sub>NClZnCl<sub>2</sub></span>) is used for the purpose of
removing the film of oxide from various metals preparatory to
soldering.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_861" id="Sect_861"></a>&sect; 861. <b>Zinc in the Arts.</b>&mdash;The use of zinc as a metal in sheeting
cisterns, articles for domestic use, alloys, &amp;c., is well known; oxide of
zinc enters largely into the composition of india-rubber. Sulphide of
zinc has been employed as a substitute for white lead, and may possibly
supersede it. Zinc white is further employed as a pigment, and, mixed
with albumen, is an agent in calico-printing; it is also used in the
decoloration of glass, in the polishing of optical glasses, and in the manufacture
of artificial meerschaum pipes.<a name="FNanchor_948" id="FNanchor_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a></p>

<p><b>Chromate of Zinc</b> (<span class="chemform">ZnCrO<sub>4</sub></span>) is used in calico-printing, and there is also
in commerce a basic chromate known as <i>zinc yellow</i>. Zinc green, or
Rinman&#8217;s green, is a beautiful innocuous colour, formed by igniting a
mixture of dry zincic and cobaltous carbonates.</p>

<p>The use of zinc vessels in the preparation of foods may occasionally
bring the metal under the notice of the analyst. When exposed to
a moist atmosphere, zinc becomes covered with a thin film of oxide,
perfectly insoluble in ordinary water; but, if the water should be charged
with common salt, a considerable quantity may be dissolved. It may
generally be laid down as a rule that the solvent power of water on zinc
has a direct relation to the chlorides present, whilst carbonate of lime
greatly diminishes this solubility.<a name="FNanchor_949" id="FNanchor_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a></p>

<p>Milk may become contaminated by zinc; for, it is a matter of common
knowledge, that milk contained in zinc vessels does not readily turn sour.
This may be explained by the zinc oxide combining with the lactic acid,
and forming the sparingly soluble lactate of zinc <span class="chemform">2(C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)Zn</span> + <span class="chemform">3H<sub>2</sub>O</span>,
thus withdrawing the lactic acid as fast as it is formed, preventing the
coagulation of the casein. With regard to this important practical subject,
MM. Payne and Chevallier made several experiments on the action
of brandy, wine, vinegar, olive oil, soup, milk, &amp;c., and proved that zinc
is acted on by all these, and especially by alcoholic, acetic, and saline
liquids. M. Schauff&eacute;le has repeated these experiments, and determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">[658]</a></span>

in experiments with sodium-zinc oxide pyrophosphate, has
shown that the essential action of zinc salts is to paralyse the muscles of
the body and the heart, and, by thus affecting the circulation and respiration,
to cause death; these main results have been fully confirmed by
Blake, Letheby, and C. Ph. Falck. For rabbits the lethal dose is &middot;08 to
&middot;09 grm. of zinc oxide, or about &middot;04 per kilogrm. The temperature
during acute poisoning sinks notably&mdash;according to F. A. Falck&#8217;s
researches on rabbits, from about 7&middot;3&deg; to 13&middot;0&deg;. Zinc is eliminated
mainly by the urine, and has been recognised in that fluid four to five
days after the last dose. It has also been separated in small quantity
from the milk and the bile.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_863" id="Sect_863"></a>&sect; 863. <b>Effects of Zinc Compounds on Man</b>&mdash;(<b>a</b>) <b>Zinc Oxide</b>.&mdash;The
poisonous action of zinc oxide is so weak that it is almost doubtful
whether it should be considered a poison. Dr. Marcett has given a
pound (453&middot;6 grms.) during a month in divided doses without injury to
a patient afflicted with epilepsy; and the workmen in zinc manufactories
cover themselves from head to foot with the dust without very apparent
bad effects. It is not, however, always innocuous, for Popoff has recorded
it as the cause of headache, pain in the head, cramps in the calves of the
legs, nausea, vomiting, and diarrh&#339;a; and he also obtained zinc from the
urine of those suffering in this manner.<a name="FNanchor_950" id="FNanchor_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a> Again, a pharmacy student<a name="FNanchor_951" id="FNanchor_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a> filled

vomiting, and a short fever. It must be remembered that, as the ordinary
zinc of commerce is seldom free from arsenic, and some samples contain
gallium, the presence of these metals may possibly have a part in the
production of the symptoms described.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_864" id="Sect_864"></a>&sect; 864. (<b>b</b>) <b>Sulphate of Zinc.</b>&mdash;Sulphate of zinc has been very
frequently taken by accident or design, but death from it is rare. The
infrequency of fatal result is due, not to any inactivity of the salt, but
rather to its being almost always expelled by vomiting, which is so constant
and regular an effect, that in doses of 1&middot;3 grm. (20 grains), sulphate
of zinc is often relied upon in poisoning from other substances to quickly
expel the contents of the stomach. In a case reported by Dr. Gibb, an
adult female swallowed 4&middot;33 grms. (67 grains), but no vomiting occurred,
and it had to be induced by other emetics; this case is unique. It is
difficult to say what would be a fatal dose of zinc sulphate, but the serious
symptoms caused by 28 grms. (1 oz.) in the case of a groom in the service
of Dr. Mackenzie, leads to the view that, although not fatal in that particular
instance, it might be in others. The man took it in mistake for
Epsom salts: a few minutes after he was violently sick and purged, and
was excessively prostrated, so that he had to be carried to his home; the
following day he had cramps in the legs, and felt weak, but was otherwise
well.</p>

<p>In a criminal case related by Tardieu and Roussin, a large dose of zinc
sulphate, put into soup, caused the death of an adult woman of sixty
years of age in about thirty hours.<a name="FNanchor_952" id="FNanchor_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a> The symptoms were violent purging
and vomiting, leading to collapse. From half of the soup a quantity of
zinc oxide, equal to 1&middot;6 grm. of zinc sulphate, was separated. Zinc was
also found in the stomach, liver, intestines, and spleen&mdash;(see also a case

which may kill by its primary or secondary effects; its local action as a
caustic is mainly to be ascribed to its intense affinity for water, dehydrating
any tissue with which it comes in contact. The common use of
disinfecting fluids containing zinc chloride, such as Burnett&#8217;s fluid, leads
to more accidents in England than in any other European country. Of
twenty-six cases of poisoning by this agent, twenty-four occurred in
England, and only two on the Continent. Death may follow the external
use of zinc chloride. Some years ago, a quack at Barnstaple, Devon,
applied zinc chloride to a cancerous breast; the woman died with all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">[660]</a></span>
general symptoms of poisoning by zinc, and that metal was found in the
liver and other organs.</p>

<p>The symptoms observed in fatal cases of chloride of zinc poisoning are&mdash;immediate
pain in the throat, and burning of the lips, tongue, &amp;c.
There is difficulty in swallowing, an increase in the secretion of saliva,
vomiting of bloody matters, diarrh&#339;a, collapse, coma, and death. In
some cases life has been prolonged for days; but, on the other hand,
death has been known to occur in a few hours. In those cases in which
either recovery has taken place, or in which death is delayed, nervous
symptoms rarely fail to make their appearance. In a case recorded by
Dr. R. Hassall, 3 ounces of Burnett&#8217;s fluid were swallowed. The usual
symptoms of intense gastro-intestinal irritation ensued, but there was no
purging until the third day; after the lapse of a fortnight, a train of
nervous symptoms set in, indicated by a complete perversion of taste and
smell. In other cases, aphonia, tetanic affections of groups of muscles,
with great muscular weakness and impairment of sight, have been noticed.
Very large doses of zinc chloride have been recovered from, <i>e.g.</i>, a man
had taken a solution equivalent to about 13 grms. (200 grains) of the
solid chloride. Vomiting came on immediately, and there was collapse,

has destroyed life after several weeks&#8217; illness.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_866" id="Sect_866"></a>&sect; 866. <b>Post-mortem Appearances.</b>&mdash;In poisoning by sulphate of zinc,
the appearances usually seen are inflammation, more or less intense, of
the mucous membrane of the stomach and bowels. In the museums of
the London hospitals, I could only find (1882) a single specimen preserved
illustrating the effects of this poison. This preparation is in St.
George&#8217;s Hospital Museum, and shows (ser. ix. 43 and 198) the stomach
of a man who died from zinc sulphate, and whose case is reported in the
<i>Lancet</i>, 1859. The mucous membrane is wrinkled all over like a piece
of tripe; when recent it was vascular and indurated, but uniformly of a
dirty grey colour; the lining membrane of the small intestine is very
vascular, and in the duodenum and upper part of the jejunum the colour
is similar to that of the stomach, but in a less marked degree; the
stomach and intestines are contracted.</p>

<p>The pathological appearances after chloride of zinc vary according to
the period at which death takes place. When it has occurred within a
few hours, the lining membrane of the mouth and gullet shows a marked
change in texture, being white and opaque, the stomach hard and leathery,
or much corrugated or ulcerated. In cases in which life has been prolonged,
contractions of the gullet and stomach may occur very similar to
those caused by the mineral acids, and with a similar train of symptoms.
In a case which occurred under Dr. Markham&#8217;s<a name="FNanchor_954" id="FNanchor_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a> observation, a person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">[661]</a></span>
died ten weeks after taking the fatal dose, the first symptoms subsiding
in a few days, and the secondary set of symptoms not commencing for
three weeks. They then consisted mainly of vomiting, until the patient
sank from exhaustion. The stomach was constricted at the pyloric end,
so that it would scarcely admit a quill.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>In Guy&#8217;s Hospital there is a good preparation, 1799<sup>35</sup>, from the case
of S. R., aged 22; she took a tablespoonful of Burnett&#8217;s fluid, and died
in about fourteen weeks. There were at first violent vomiting and
purging, but she suffered little pain, and in a day or two recovered
sufficiently to move about the house; but the vomiting after food continued,
everything being ejected about five minutes after swallowing.
Before death she suffered from pneumonia. The stomach is seen to be
much contracted&mdash;5 inches in length; it is ulcerated both near the
pylorus and near the gullet; at the latter part there is a pouch-like
portion of the mucous membrane of the stomach adherent to the spleen,
which communicates by a perforation with an abscess formed and bounded
by the stomach, diaphragm, and spleen; it contained 3 ozs. of dirty-looking
pus. At the pylorus, in the centre, there is a second perforation,
but extravasation of the contents is prevented by the adherent omentum
and transverse colon. The muscular coats are thickened.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_867" id="Sect_867"></a>&sect; 867. <b>Detection of Zinc in Organic Liquids or Solids.</b>&mdash;In cases
where the poison has been expelled from the stomach by vomiting, the
muscles and bones would appear to be the best tissues to examine chemically;
for Matzkewitsch investigated very carefully a dog poisoned by
100 parts of zinc, subcutaneously injected in the form of acetate, and
found it distributed over the several organs of the body in the following
ratios:&mdash;Muscles 60&middot;5, bones 24&middot;41, stomach and intestines 4&middot;63, skin
3&middot;70, place of injection 2&middot;19, liver 1&middot;75, lungs and heart 1&middot;68, kidneys,
bladder, and urine 1&middot;14.</p>

<p>The only certain method of detection is to produce the sulphide of
zinc, best effected by saturating a neutral or feebly acid liquid with
hydric sulphide. If an organic liquid, which can be easily filtered, is
operated upon, it may be strongly acidulated with acetic acid, and at
once treated with hydric sulphide. If, however, zinc is sought for as a
part of a systematic examination (as will most likely be the case), the
solution will have been treated with hydrochloric acid, and already
tested for arsenic, antimony, lead, &amp;c., and filtered from any precipitate.
In such a case the hydrochloric acid must first be replaced by acetic,
which is effected by adding a slight excess of sodic acetate; the right
quantity of the latter is easily known, if the hydrochloric acid originally
added was carefully measured, and its specific gravity ascertained; 3&middot;72
of crystallised sodic acetate saturating one of <span class="chemform">HCl</span>. Lastly, should the
distillation process, given at <a href="#Page_49">p. 49</a>, have been adopted, the contents of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">[662]</a></span>
retort will only require to be treated with water, filtered, and saturated
with sulphuretted hydrogen. In any of the above cases, should a white,
dirty white or lightish-coloured precipitate (which is not sulphur) be
thrown down, zinc may be suspected; it will, however, be absolutely
necessary to identify the sulphide, for there are many sources of error.
The most satisfactory of all identifications is the production of Rinman&#8217;s
green. The supposed sulphide is dissolved off the filter with hot nitric
acid, a drop or more (according to the quantity of the original precipitate)
of solution of cobalt nitrate added, the solution precipitated with
carbonate of soda and boiled, to expel all carbonic anhydride; the precipitate
is then collected on a filter, washed, dried, and ignited in a
platinum dish. If zinc be present in so small a proportion as 1&middot;100,000
part, the mass will be permanently green.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_868" id="Sect_868"></a>&sect; 868. Other methods of procedure are as follows:&mdash;The supposed
zinc sulphide (after being well washed) is collected in a porcelain dish,
and dissolved in a few drops of sulphuric acid, filtered, nitric acid added,
evaporated to dryness, and heated to destroy all organic matter. When
cool, the mass is treated with water acidulated by sulphuric acid, and
again filtered. The solution may contain iron as well as zinc, and if the
former (on testing a drop with ferrocyanide of potash) appears in any
quantity, it must be separated by the addition of ammonia in excess to
the ammoniacal filtrate; sodic carbonate is added in excess, the liquid
well boiled, and the precipitate collected on a filter and washed. The
carbonate of zinc thus obtained is converted into zinc oxide by ignition,
and weighed. If oxide of zinc, it will be yellow when hot, white when
cold: it will dissolve in acetic acid; give a white precipitate with sulphuretted
hydrogen; and, finally, if heated on charcoal in the oxidising
flame, and moistened with cobalt nitrate solution, a green colour will
result. Zinc may also be separated from liquids by electrolysis. The
simplest way is to place the fluid under examination in a platinum dish
of sufficient size, acidify, and insert a piece of magnesium tape. The
metallic film so obtained may be dissolved by hydrochloric acid, and the
usual tests applied.</p>

<h4>2. NICKEL&mdash;COBALT.</h4>

<p><a name="Sect_869" id="Sect_869"></a>&sect; 869. The salts of nickel and cobalt have at present no toxicological
importance, although, from the experiments of Anderson Stuart,<a name="FNanchor_955" id="FNanchor_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a> both
may be classed as poisonous. The experiments of Gmelin had, prior to
Stuart&#8217;s researches, shown that nickel sulphate introduced into the
stomach acted as an irritant poison, and, if introduced into the blood,
caused death by cardiac paralysis. Anderson Stuart, desiring to avoid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">[663]</a></span>
all local irritant action, dissolved nickel carbonate in acid citrate of soda
by the aid of a gentle heat; he then evaporated the solution, and
obtained a glass which, if too alkaline, was neutralised by citric acid,
until its reaction approximated to the feeble alkalinity of the blood; the
cobalt salt was produced in the same way. The animals experimented
on were frogs, fish, pigeons, rats, guinea-pigs, rabbits, cats, and dogs&mdash;in
all 200. The lethal dose of nickelous oxide, when subcutaneously
injected in the soluble compound described, was found to be as follows:&mdash;frogs,
&middot;08 grm. per kilogram; pigeons, &middot;06; guinea-pigs, &middot;030; rats,
&middot;025; cats, &middot;01; rabbits, &middot;009; and dogs, &middot;007. The cobaltous oxide
was found to be much less active, requiring the above doses to be
increased about two-thirds. In other respects, its physiological action
seems to be very similar to that of nickelous oxide.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p><a name="Sect_870" id="Sect_870"></a>&sect; 870. <b>Symptoms&mdash;Frogs.</b>&mdash;A large dose injected into the dorsal
lymph sac of the frog causes the following symptoms:&mdash;The colour of
the skin all over the body becomes darker and more uniform, and not
infrequently a white froth is abundantly poured over the integument.
In an interval of about twenty minutes the frog sits quietly, the eyes
retracted and shut; if molested, it moves clumsily. When quiet, the
fore limbs are weak, and the hind legs drawn up very peculiarly, the
thighs being jammed up so against the body, that they come to lie on
the dorsal aspect of the sides of the frog, and the legs are so much flexed
that the feet lie on the animal&#8217;s back, quite internal to the plane of
the thighs. Soon fibrillary twitchings are observed in the muscles of the
abdominal wall, then feeble twitchings of the fingers, and muscles of the
fore limbs generally; lastly, the toes are seen to twitch, and then the
muscles of the hind limbs&mdash;this order is nearly always observed; now
spasmodic gaping and inco&ouml;rdinate movements are seen, and the general
aspect is not unlike the symptoms caused by picrotoxin. After this,
tetanus sets in, and the symptoms then resemble those of strychnine; the
next stage is stupefaction and voluntary motor paresis; the respiratory
movements become feeble, and the paresis passes into paralysis. The
heart beats more and more slowly and feebly, and death gradually and
imperceptibly supervenes. The <i>post-mortem</i> appearances are well marked,
<i>i.e.</i>, rigor mortis, slight congestion of the alimentary tract, the heart
with the auricle much dilated and filled with dark blood, the ventricle
mostly small, pale, and semi-contracted. For some time after death, the
nerve trunks and muscles react to the induction current.</p>

<p><b>Pigeons.</b>&mdash;In experiments on pigeons the symptoms were those of
dulness and stupor, jerkings of different sets of muscles, and then death
quietly.</p>

<p><b>Guinea-pigs.</b>&mdash;In guinea-pigs there were dulness and stupefaction,
with some weakness of the hind limbs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">[664]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Rats.</b>&mdash;The symptoms in rats were almost entirely nervous; they
became drowsy and apathetic, and there was paralysis of the hind legs.</p>

<p><b>Rabbits.</b>&mdash;In rabbits, also, the symptoms were mainly those caused by
an affection of the nervous system. There was paralysis, which affected
either the hind legs only, or all four limbs. The cervical muscles
became so weak that the animal was unable to hold its head up.
Diarrh&#339;a occurred and persisted until death. If the dose is not large
enough to kill rapidly, the reflex irritability is decidedly increased, so that
the slightest excitation may cause the animal to cower and tremble all over.
Now appear twitchings and contractions of single groups of muscles, and
this excitement becomes general. The respirations also become slower
and more difficult, and sometimes there is well-marked dilatation of the
vessels of the ears and <i>fundi oculi</i>. Convulsions close the scene.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_871" id="Sect_871"></a>&sect; 871. <b>Circulation.</b>&mdash;The effect of the salt on the frog&#8217;s heart was also
studied in detail. It seems that, under the influence of a soluble salt
of nickel, the heart beats more and more slowly, it becomes smaller and
paler, and does not contract evenly throughout the whole extent of the
ventricle; but the rhythm of the ventricular and auricular contractions
is never lost.</p>

<p>It is probable that there is a vaso-motor paralysis of the abdominal
vessels; the blood-pressure falls, and the heart is not stimulated by the
blood itself as in its normal state. In support of this view, it is found
that, by either pressing on the abdomen or simply inverting the frog, the
heart swells up, fills with blood, and for a time beats well.</p>

<p><b>Nervous System.</b>&mdash;The toxic action is referable to the central nervous
system, and not to that of peripheral motor nerve-endings or motor nerve-fibres.
It is probable that both nickel and cobalt paralyse to some
extent the cerebrum. The action on the nerve-centres is similar to that
of platinum or barium, and quite different from that of iron.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_872" id="Sect_872"></a>&sect; 872. <b>Action on Striped Muscle.</b>&mdash;Neither nickel nor cobalt has
any effect on striped muscle. In this they both differ from arsenic,
antimony, mercury, lead, and iron&mdash;all of which, in large doses, diminish
the work which healthy muscle is capable of performing.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_873" id="Sect_873"></a>&sect; 873. <b>Separation of Nickel or Cobalt from the Organic Matters or
Tissues.</b>&mdash;It is very necessary, if any case of poisoning should occur by
either or both of these metals, to destroy completely the organic matters
by the process already detailed on <a href="#Page_51">p. 51</a>. Both nickel and cobalt are
thrown down, if in the form of acetate, from a neutral solution by
sulphuretted hydrogen; but the precipitation does not take place in the
presence of free mineral acid; hence, in the routine process of analysis,
sulphuretted hydrogen is passed into the acid liquid, and any precipitate
filtered off. The liquid is now made almost neutral by potassic carbonate,
and then potassic acetate added, and a current of sulphuretted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">[665]</a></span>
hydrogen passed through it. The sulphides of cobalt and nickel, if both
are present, will be thrown down; under the same circumstances zinc,
if present, would also be precipitated. Cobalt is separated from zinc by
dissolving the mixed sulphides in nitric acid, precipitating the carbonates
of zinc and cobalt by potassic carbonate, collecting the carbonates, and,
after washing, igniting them gently in a bulb tube, in a current of dry
hydrochloric acid; volatile zinc chloride is formed and distils over,
leaving cobalt chloride.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_874" id="Sect_874"></a>&sect; 874. To estimate cobalt, sulphide of cobalt may be dissolved in
nitric acid, and then precipitated by pure potash; the precipitate
washed, dried, ignited, and weighed; 100 parts of cobaltous oxide
(<span class="chemform">Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub></span>) equals 73&middot;44 of metallic cobalt. Cobalt is separated from nickel
by a method essentially founded on one proposed by Liebig. The nitric
acid solution of nickel and cobalt (which must be free from all other
metals, save potassium or sodium) is nearly neutralised by potassic
carbonate, and mixed with an excess of hydrocyanic acid, and then with
pure caustic potash. The mixture is left exposed to the air in a shallow
dish for some hours, a tripotassic cobalticyanide (<span class="chemform">K<sub>3</sub>CoCy<sub>6</sub></span>) and a
nickelo-potassic cyanide (<span class="chemform">2KCy</span>, <span class="chemform">NiCy<sub>4</sub></span>) are in this way produced. If
this solution is now boiled with a slight excess of mercuric nitrate,
hydrated nickelous oxide is precipitated, but potassic cobalticyanide
remains in solution, and may be filtered off. On carefully neutralising
the alkaline filtrate with nitric acid, and adding a solution of mercurous
nitrate, the cobalt may then be precipitated as a mercurous cobalticyanide,
which may be collected, washed, dried, decomposed by ignition,
and weighed as cobaltous oxide. After obtaining both nickel and cobalt
oxides, or either of them, they may be easily identified by the blowpipe.
The oxide of nickel gives, in the oxidising flame with borax, a yellowish-red
glass, becoming paler as it cools; the addition of a potassium salt
colours the bead blue. In the reducing flame the metal is reduced, and
can be seen as little greyish particles disseminated through the bead.
Cobalt gives an intense blue colour to a bead of borax in the oxidising
flame.</p>

<h4>1. IRON.</h4>

<p><a name="Sect_875" id="Sect_875"></a>&sect; 875. It was Orfila&#8217;s opinion that all the salts of iron were poisonous,
if given in sufficient doses; but such salts as the carbonate, the phosphate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">[666]</a></span>
and a few others, possessing no local action, may be given in such
very large doses, without causing disturbance to the health, that the
statement must only be taken as applying to the more soluble iron
compounds. The two preparations of iron which have any forensic
importance are the perchloride and the sulphate.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_876" id="Sect_876"></a>&sect; 876. <b>Ferric Chloride</b> (<span class="chemform">Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub></span> = 325).&mdash;Anhydrous ferric chloride
will only be met with in the laboratory. As a product of passing dry
chlorine over red-hot iron, it sublimes in brown scales, is very deliquescent,
and hisses when thrown into water. There are two very definite
hydrates&mdash;one with 6 atoms of water, forming large, red, deliquescent
crystals; and another with 12 of water, less deliquescent, and crystallising
in orange stellate groups.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_877" id="Sect_877"></a>&sect; 877. <b>Effects of Ferric Chloride on Animals.</b>&mdash;A very elaborate
series of researches on rabbits, dogs, and cats was undertaken a few years
ago by MM. B&eacute;renger-F&eacute;raud and Porte<a name="FNanchor_956" id="FNanchor_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a> to elucidate the general
symptoms and effects produced by ferric chloride under varying conditions.
First, a series of experiments showed that, when ferric chloride
solution was enclosed in gelatine capsules and given with the food of the
animal, it produced either no symptoms or but trifling inconvenience,
even when the dose exceeded 1 grm. per kilogrm.; anhydrous ferric
chloride and the ferric chloride solution were directly injected into the
stomach, yet, when food was present, death did not occur, and the effects
soon subsided. In animals which were fasting, quantities of the solution
equal to &middot;5 grm. per kilogrm. and above caused death in from one hour
to sixteen hours, the action being much accelerated by the addition of
alcohol&mdash;as, for example, in the case of the tincture: the symptoms were
mainly vomiting and diarrh&#339;a, sometimes the vomiting was absent. In
a few cases the posterior extremities were paralysed, and the pupils
dilated: the urine was scanty or quite suppressed; death was preceded
by convulsions.</p>

has been popularly used in England, from its supposed abortive property,
and is sold under the name of &#8220;steel drops.&#8221; It has been frequently
taken by mistake for other dark liquids; and there is at least one case
on record in which it was proved to have been used for the purpose of
murder. The latter case<a name="FNanchor_957" id="FNanchor_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a> is peculiarly interesting from its great rarity;
it occurred in Martinique in 1874-1876, no less than four persons being
poisoned at different dates. All four were presumed to have had immoral
relations with a certain widow X&mdash;&mdash;, and to have been poisoned
by her son. In three of the four cases, viz., Char&mdash;&mdash;, Duf&mdash;&mdash;, and
Lab&mdash;&mdash;, the cause of death seems pretty clear; but the fourth, Ab&mdash;&mdash;,
a case of strong suspicion, was not sufficiently investigated. All three
took the fatal dose in the evening, between eight and nine o&#8217;clock&mdash;Lab&mdash;&mdash;
the 27th of December 1874, Duf&mdash;&mdash; the 22nd of February
1876, and Char&mdash;&mdash; on the 14th of May 1876. They had all passed
the day in tippling, and they all had eaten nothing from mid-day, so that
the stomach would, in none of the three, contain any solid matters. The
chloride was given to them in a glass of &#8220;punch,&#8221; and there was strong
evidence to show that the son of the widow X&mdash;&mdash; administered it.
Char&mdash;&mdash; died after about thirteen hours&#8217; illness, Duf&mdash;&mdash; and Lab&mdash;&mdash;
after sixty-five hours&#8217; illness; Ab&mdash;&mdash; lived from three to four days.
With Char&mdash;&mdash; the symptoms were very pronounced in an hour, and
consisted essentially of violent colicky pain in the abdomen and diarrh&#339;a,
but there was no vomiting; Duf&mdash;&mdash; had also great pain in the abdomen
and suppression of the urine. Lab&mdash;&mdash; had most violent abdominal
pains; he was constipated, and the urinary secretion was arrested; there
was besides painful tenesmus. According to the experiments of B&eacute;renger-F&eacute;raud
and Porte,<a name="FNanchor_958" id="FNanchor_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a> the perchloride in the above cases was taken under
conditions peculiarly favourable for the development of its toxic action,
viz., on an empty stomach and mixed with alcohol.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_880" id="Sect_880"></a>&sect; 880. <b>Post-mortem Appearances.</b>&mdash;In the experiments on animals
already referred to, the general changes noted were dryness, pallor, and
parchment-like appearance of the cavity of the mouth, the mucous membrane
being blackened by the contact of the liquid. The gullet was pale
and dry, not unfrequently covered with a blackish layer. The mucous
membrane of the stomach was generally healthy throughout; but, if the
dose was large and very concentrated, there might be one or more
hyper&aelig;mic spots; otherwise, this did not occur. The internal surface
of the intestines, similarly, showed no inflammation, but was covered
with brownish coating which darkened on exposure to the air. The
liver, in all the experiments, was large and gorged with black and fluid
blood; there were ecchymoses in the lungs and venous congestion. The
kidneys were usually hyper&aelig;mic, and contained little h&aelig;morrhages.
There was also general encephalic engorgement, and in one experiment
intense congestion of the meninges was observed. Few opportunities
have presented themselves for pathological observations relative to the
effects produced by ferric chloride on man. In a case related by Christison,
in which a man swallowed 42&middot;4 c.c. (1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> oz.) of the tincture, and
died in five weeks, there was found thickening and inflammation of the
pyloric end of the stomach.</p>

<p>The case of Char&mdash;&mdash;, already alluded to, is that in which the most
complete details of the autopsy are recorded, and they coincide very fairly
with those observed in animals; the tongue was covered with a greenish
fur, bordered at the edges with a black substance, described as being like
&#8220;mud&#8221;; the lining membrane of the gullet was pale, but also covered
with this dark &#8220;mud.&#8221; The stomach contained a greenish-black liquid;
the liver was large and congested; the kidneys were swollen, congested,
and ecchymosed; the cerebral membranes were gorged with blood, and
the whole brain hyper&aelig;mic.</p>

about 1&middot;5 times their weight of water; the commercial article nearly
always responds to the tests, both for ferrous and ferric salts, containing
a little persalt. The medicinal dose of this salt is usually given as from
&middot;0648 to &middot;324 grm. (1 to 5 grains), but it has been prescribed in cases
requiring it in gramme (15&middot;4 grains) doses without injury. Sulphate of
iron has many technical applications; is employed by all shoemakers,
and is in common use as a disinfectant. The salt has been employed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">[669]</a></span>
criminal purposes in France, and in this country it is a popular abortive.
In recorded cases, the symptoms, as well as the pathological appearances,
have a striking resemblance to those produced by the chloride. There
are usually colic, vomiting, and purging; but in one case (reported by
Chevallier), in which a man gave a large dose of sulphate of iron to his
wife, there was neither vomiting nor colic; the woman lost her appetite,
but slowly recovered. Probably the action of ferrous sulphate, like that
of the chloride, is profoundly modified by the presence or absence of
food in the stomach. Anything like 28&middot;3 grms. (an ounce) of sulphate
of iron must be considered a dangerous dose, for, though recovery has
taken place from this quantity, the symptoms have been of a violent kind.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_882" id="Sect_882"></a>&sect; 882. <b>Search for Iron Salts in the Contents of the Stomach, &amp;c.</b>&mdash;Iron,
being a natural component of the body, care must be taken not to
confound the iron of the blood or tissues with the &#8220;iron&#8221; of a soluble
salt. Orfila attempted to distinguish between the two kinds of iron by
treating the contents of the stomach, the intestines, and even the tissues,
with cold acetic acid, and allowing them to digest in it for many hours
before filtering and testing for iron in the filtrate, and this is generally
the process which has been adopted. The acid filtrate is first treated
with sulphuretted hydrogen, which gives no precipitate with iron, and
then with sulphide of ammonium, which precipitates iron black. The
iron sulphide may be dissolved by a little hydrochloric acid and a drop
of nitric acid, and farther identified by its forming Prussian blue when
tested by ferrocyanide of potash, or by the bulky precipitate of oxide,
when the acid liquid is alkalised by ammonia. In the case of Duf&mdash;&mdash;,
the experts attempted to prove the existence of foreign iron in the liver
by taking 100 grms. of Duf&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;s liver and 100 grms. of the liver of a
non-poisoned person, and destroying each by nitro-muriatic acid, and
estimating in each acid solution the ferric oxide. Duf&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;s liver yielded
in 100 parts &middot;08 mgrm. of ferric oxide, the normal liver &middot;022&mdash;nearly
three times less than Duf&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;s.</p>

<p>To obtain iron from the urine, the fluid must be evaporated down to a
syrup in a platinum dish, a little nitric acid added, heated, and finally
completely carbonised. The residue is dissolved in hydrochloric acid.
Normal urine always contains an unweighable trace of iron; and, therefore,
any quantity, such as a mgrm. of ferric oxide, obtained by careful
precipitation of the hydrochloric acid solution out of 200 to 300 c.c. of
urine, would be good evidence that a soluble salt of iron had been taken.
The hydrochloric acid solution is first precipitated by ammonia and
ammonic sulphide. The precipitate thus obtained will not be pure
iron sulphide, but mixed with the earth phosphates. It should be
redissolved in <span class="chemform">HCl</span>, precipitated by sodic carbonate, then acidified by
acetic acid and sodic acetate added, and the solution well boiled; the iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">[670]</a></span>
will then be precipitated for the most part as oxide mixed with a little
phosphate of iron.</p>

<p>Since, as before mentioned, a great portion of the iron swallowed as a
soluble salt is converted into insoluble compounds and excreted by the
f&aelig;ces, it is, in any case where poisoning by iron is suspected, of more
importance to examine chemically the f&aelig;ces and the whole length of the
alimentary canal, than even the contents of the stomach. In particular,
any black material lying on the mucous membrane may be sulphide of
iron mixed with mucus, &amp;c., and should be detached, dissolved in a little
hydrochloric acid, and the usual tests applied.</p>

<p>In the criminal cases alluded to, there were iron stains on certain linen
garments which acquired an importance, for, on dissolving by the aid of
nitric acid, they gave the reactions of chlorine and iron. Any stains
found should be cut out, steeped in water, and boiled. If no iron is dissolved
the stain should then be treated with dilute nitric acid, and the
liquid tested with ferrocyanide of potash, &amp;c. It need scarcely be
observed that iron-mould is so common on shirts and any fabric capable
of being washed, that great care must be exercised in drawing conclusions
from insoluble deposits of the oxide.</p>

form of citron-yellow rhombic crystals, easily soluble in water, but
insoluble in alcohol. Its aqueous solution is precipitated yellow by lead
acetate or basic acetate; the precipitate being insoluble in acetic acid. If
chromate of potash in solution is tested with silver nitrate, the red chromate
of silver is thrown down; the precipitate is with difficulty soluble in
dilute nitric acid.</p>

large, red, transparent, four-sided tables; it is anhydrous and fuses below
redness. At a high temperature it is decomposed into green oxide of
chromium and yellow chromate of potash. It is insoluble in alcohol, but
readily soluble in water. The solution gives the same precipitates with
silver, lead, and barium as the neutral chromate. On digesting a solution
of the bichromate with sulphuric acid and alcohol, the solution becomes

Disease.</b>&mdash;In manufacturing potassic bichromate, the workmen
exposed to the dust have suffered from a very peculiar train of symptoms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">[672]</a></span>
known under the name of &#8220;bichromate disease.&#8221; It was first described
in England by Sir B. W. Richardson.<a name="FNanchor_963" id="FNanchor_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a> It appears that if the workmen
inspire the particles chiefly through the mouth, a bitter and disagreeable
taste is experienced, with an increase of saliva. This increase of the
buccal secretion gets rid of most of the poison, and in that case but little
ill effect is experienced; but those who keep the mouth closed and inspire
by the nose, suffer from an inflammation of the septum, which gradually
gets thin, and ultimately ulcerated; finally the whole of the septum is in
this way destroyed. It is stated that when a workman has lost his nasal
septum, he no longer suffers from nasal irritation, and has a remarkable
immunity from catarrh. The Chemical Works Committee of Inquiry
report (1893) that the manufacture of bichromate of potash or soda is
practically in the hands of three firms at Glasgow, Rutherglen, and Falkirk,
and that they visited all of them, and found &#8220;that almost all the
men working where dust was prevalent, more especially between the furnaces
and the dissolving tanks, had either perforation of the septum of
the nose, or had lost the septum altogether.&#8221; The bichromate also causes
painful skin affections&mdash;eruptions akin to eczema or psoriasis; also very
deep and intractable ulcerations. These the workers call &#8220;chrome holes.&#8221;
These cutaneous maladies start from an excoriation; so long as the skin
is not broken, there seems to be little local effect, if any. The effects of
the bichromate are also seen in horses employed at the factories; the salt
getting into a wound or crack in the leg, produces ulceration: horses may
even lose their hoofs.</p>

symptoms commenced in fifteen minutes, and consisted of lightness in
the head, and a sensation of great heat in the body, which was followed
by a cold sweat; in twenty minutes he vomited; he then suffered from
great pain in the stomach, giddiness, specks before the eyes, a devouring
thirst, and there was loss of power over the legs. These symptoms,
again, were followed by severe rigors and great coldness of the extremities.
On the patient&#8217;s admission to hospital, two hours after taking
the poison, it was noted that the pupils were dilated, the face pale and
cold, and the pulse feeble. He complained of intense epigastric pain,
and a feeling of depression; there was some stupor; the stomach was
emptied by emetics and by the stomach-pump, and the patient treated

changes. The epithelium of the tubuli contorti exhibits a yellow cloudiness,
and the outline of the cells is irregular and jagged. The glomeruli
are moderately injected, and their capsules contain an albuminous exudation;
the canaliculi are filled with round cells imbedded in a fluid which,

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>In the case quoted of the woman who poisoned herself with potassic
chromate, very striking changes were found in the stomach and intestines.
The stomach contained above a litre of dark chocolate fluid of
alkaline reaction; the mucous membrane, in the neighbourhood of the
cardiac and pyloric extremities, was swollen and red in sharply defined
patches; portions of the epithelial layer were detached, the rest of the
mucous membrane was of a yellow-brown colour, and the whole intestine,
from the duodenum to the sigmoid flexure, was filled with a partly
bloody, partly treacly-looking fluid; the mucous membrane, throughout
its entire extent, was swollen, with numerous extravasations, and in
places there were losses of substance. Similar appearances to these have
been found in other instances; the anomalous case recorded by Mr.
Wilson (<i><a href="#Footnote_966">ante</a></i>) is an exception. In this instance a pint of inky, turbid
liquid, which yielded to analysis potassic bichromate, was found in the
stomach; but there were no marked changes anywhere, save a slight
redness of the cardiac end of the gullet. In Linstow&#8217;s two cases of
poisoning by lead chromate, there were found in both fatty degeneration
of the liver cells, and red points or patches of redness in the stomach
and intestines. In the elder boy the changes in the duodenum were
very intense, the mucous membrane was swollen and easily detached, in
the upper part strongly injected with blood; in one place there was a
perforation, and in several places the membrane was extremely thin. In
the younger boy the kidneys seem to have been normal, in the elder
congested and containing pus. Although it was clear that the two
children died from lead chromate, a chemical analysis gave no result.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_892" id="Sect_892"></a>&sect; 892. <b>Detection of the Chromates and Separation of the Salts
of Chromium from the Contents of the Stomach, &amp;c.</b>&mdash;If in the
methodical examination of an acid liquid, which has been already

hydrogen, this liquid is made alkaline (the alkali only being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_675" id="Page_675">[675]</a></span>
added in slight excess), and hydrated chromic oxide is thrown down
mixed, it may be with other metals of the second class, the precipitate
may then be fused with nitre and potassic carbonate, and will
yield potassic chromate, soluble in water, and recognised by the red precipitate
which it gives with silver nitrate, the yellow with lead acetate,
and the green colour produced by boiling with dilute sulphuric acid and
a little alcohol or sugar. If by treating a complex liquid with ammonium
hydrosulphide, sulphides of zinc, manganese, and iron are thrown down
mixed with chromic oxide, the same principles apply. If a chromate is
present in the contents of the stomach, and the organic fluid is treated
with hydrochloric acid and potassic chlorate, chromic chloride is formed,
and dissolving imparts a green colour to the liquid&mdash;this in itself will be
strong evidence of the presence of a chromate, but it should be supplemented
by throwing down the oxide, and transforming it in the way
detailed into potassic chromate.</p>

<p>A general method of detecting and estimating both chromium and
barium in organic matters has been worked out by L. de Koningh.<a name="FNanchor_972" id="FNanchor_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a>
The substances are burnt to an ash in a platinum dish. The ash is
weighed; to the ash is added four times its weight of potassium sodium
carbonate and the same amount of potassium nitrate; and the whole is
fused for fifteen minutes. The fused mass is boiled with water and
filtered; if chromium is present, the filtrate is of a more or less pronounced
yellow colour, but manganese may produce a green colour and
mask the yellow; this colour is removed by boiling with a little alcohol.
The liquid is concentrated down to 20 c.c., filtered into a test-tube, and
a colorimetric estimation made of the chromium present by imitating the
colour by a solution of potassium chromate of known strength. To prove
that the colour is really due to chromium, acetic acid and lead acetate are
added, when the yellow chromate of lead is at once thrown down. (If
lead was in the ash, a yellow precipitate may appear on the addition of
acetic acid.) To the portion of ash insoluble in water strong hydrochloric
acid is added, and to the acid solution a large excess of calcium sulphate
is added; this precipitates barium as sulphate free from lead sulphate,
for, if the latter should be present, it does not, under the circumstances,
come down, being soluble in strong hydrochloric acid.</p>

thallium are both soluble in water, the carbonate less so, requiring about 25 parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">[676]</a></span>
of water for solution, while the chloride is sparingly soluble, especially in hydrochloric
acid.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_894" id="Sect_894"></a>&sect; 894. <b>Effects.</b>&mdash;All the salts of thallium are poisonous. One of the earlier
experimenters on the physiological action, Paulet, found 1 grm. (15&middot;4 grains) of
thallium carbonate sufficient to kill a rabbit in a few hours; there were loss of muscular
power, trembling of the limbs, and death apparently from asphyxia. Lamy<a name="FNanchor_973" id="FNanchor_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a>
used thallium sulphate, and found that dogs were salivated, and suffered from
trembling of the limbs, followed by paralysis. The most definite results were
obtained by Marm&eacute;,<a name="FNanchor_974" id="FNanchor_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a> who found that &middot;04 to &middot;06 grm. of a soluble thallium salt,
injected subcutaneously or directly into the veins, and &middot;5 grm. administered through
the stomach of rabbits, caused death. The action is cumulative, and something
like that of mercury: there are redness and swelling of the mucous membrane of the
stomach, with mucous bloody discharges; h&aelig;morrhage may also occur from the
lungs. Thallium is eliminated through the urine, and is also found in the f&aelig;ces; it
passes into the urine from three to five minutes after injection: the elimination is
slow, often taking as long as three weeks. It has been found in the milk, in the
tears, in the mucous membrane of the mouth, of the trachea, in the secretion of the
gastric mucous membrane, and in the pericardial fluid; and in these places, whether
the poison has been introduced by subcutaneous injection, or by any other channel.
It seems probable that the reason of its being detected so readily in all the secretions
is the minute quantity which can be discovered by spectroscopic analysis.</p>

thallium, if absorbed, would only be extracted in traces from the tissues by hydrochloric
acid, so that, in any special search, the tissues are best destroyed by either
sulphuric or nitric acid, or both. In the ordinary method of analysis, when an acid
liquid is first treated with sulphuretted hydrogen, and then made alkaline by
ammonia and ammonic sulphide, thallium would be thrown down with the manganese
and iron of the blood. From the mixed sulphides, thallium may be separated by
oxidising and dissolving the sulphides with nitric acid, evaporating off the excess of
acid, dissolving in a very little hot water, and precipitating thallous chloride by
solution of common salt. The ease, however, with which thallium may be separated
from solutions of its salts by galvanism is so great as to render all other processes
unnecessary: the best way, therefore, is to obtain a deposit of the metal on platinum
by a current from one or more cells, and then to examine the deposit spectroscopically.
Thallium gives, when heated in a Bunsen flame, a magnificent green line, the centre
of which corresponds with wave length 534&middot;9; a second green line, the centre of
which coincides with W.L. 568, may also be distinguished.</p>

<h4>4. ALUMINIUM.</h4>

<p><a name="Sect_896" id="Sect_896"></a>&sect; 896. <b>Aluminium and its Salts.</b>&mdash;A strong solution of acetate of
alumina has irritant properties, and has given rise to accidents. The
term alum, in a chemical sense, is given to a class of bodies of the
type of <span class="chemform">AlKSO<sub>4</sub></span>. Common alum is at the present time ammonia alum,
<span class="chemform">NH<sub>4</sub>Al(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub></span> + <span class="chemform">12H<sub>2</sub>O</span>; when made anhydrous by heat it is known by
the name of burnt alum, and possesses caustic properties.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_897" id="Sect_897"></a>&sect; 897. <b>Action of Alum Salts.</b>&mdash;Death or illness has hitherto only
taken place from the ingestion of large doses of alum or the acetate, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677">[677]</a></span>
the symptoms in these cases have been those of an irritant poison; we
are, however, indebted to Paul Siem<a name="FNanchor_975" id="FNanchor_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a> for a research on the absorbed
substance, in which the local effects as far as possible have been
reduced.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>Siem&#8217;s research was made on frogs, cats, and dogs. For frogs he
employed a double salt, consisting of sodic and aluminic lactate, to which
he ascribed the formula <span class="chemform">Al<sub>2</sub>(C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>(C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>4</sub>NaO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub></span>, equal to 15&middot;2 per
cent. of <span class="chemform">Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub></span>. Twenty to thirty mgrms., administered by subcutaneous
injection to frogs, caused death in from ten to twenty-four hours. After
the injection there was restlessness, and, ultimately, general paralysis of
the central nervous system. The circulation was not affected; the heart
was the last to die.</p>

<p>For warm-blooded animals he used the double tartrate of sodium and
aluminium. Beginning with a small dose subcutaneously administered,
he gradually increased it, and found, under these circumstances, that the
lethal dose for rabbits was 0&middot;3 grm. per kilo. of body weight; for dogs
0&middot;25 grm., and for cats 0&middot;25 to 0&middot;28 grm.; if, however, a single dose was
administered, then cats could be killed by 0&middot;15 grm. per kilo. The
symptoms commenced ten to twelve hours after the injection of a large
dose, but with a medium dose the symptoms might be delayed for from
three to four days, then there was loss of appetite, constipation, emaciation,
languor, and a disinclination to move. Vomiting and loss of sensation
to pain followed, the power of swallowing even saliva was lost, and
a condition supervened similar to bulbar paralysis. However true this
picture may be when large doses are given subcutaneously, it does not
follow that hydrate of alumina in small doses, given by the mouth, mixed
with food, produces any symptoms whatever.</p>

<p>Alum baking-powders, containing from 30 to 40 per cent. of alum
mixed with carbonate of soda, are in commerce, and have been for a long
time, many tons being sold yearly. When water is added to such
powders decomposition takes place, the result being sodic sulphate and
aluminic hydrate, carbonic acid being given off. Were the hydrate, in
small doses, capable of producing indigestion or disease of the central
nervous system, it seems astonishing that, considering the enormous
number of persons who use alum baking-powders, there should not be
some definite evidence of its effect. The author and his family for
months together have used alum baking-powders without any apparent
injury, and there is little doubt that alumina hydrate passes out of the
system mainly by the bowel, without being absorbed to any great extent.
In a trial with regard to an alum baking-powder at Pontypridd (1893),
the prosecution advanced the theory, and supported it by eminent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678">[678]</a></span>
scientific opinion, that aluminium hydrate was dissolved by the hydrochloric
acid of the gastric juice, forming chloride of aluminium, some of
which might be absorbed and enter the circulation; that which was not
absorbed in the stomach passed on, and, meeting the alkaline fluids of
the intestines, was again separated as aluminium hydrate, and as such
absorbed.</p>

<p>If this does occur, still there is no direct evidence of its toxic influence
in the small quantities used in baking-powder. It may be pointed out,
also, that with regard to the possible lethal effect of a non-corrosive salt
of alum, presuming that the lethal dose for man is the same as that for
a cat, the amount of alumina to kill a 68-kilogramme man would have to
be equal to 17 grms., or about 3 ozs. of ammonia alum. This important
question can only be settled by careful feeding of animals carried on for
a long period of time.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_898" id="Sect_898"></a>&sect; 898. <b>Post-mortem Appearances.</b>&mdash;In the few cases in which
persons have been killed by large doses of alum or its salts there have
been found corrosion of the mouth, throat, and stomach, and hyper&aelig;mia
of the kidneys and intestine. In the animals experimented upon by
Paul Siem, hyper&aelig;mia of the intestine, fatty degeneration of the liver and
hyaline degeneration of the kidneys were the chief changes noted.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_899" id="Sect_899"></a>&sect; 899. <b>Detection of Alumina.</b>&mdash;In all operations for the detection of
alumina, glass and porcelain vessels are to be avoided. The substances
should be burned to an ash in a platinum dish, the ash treated with
hydrochloric acid, the acid driven off by heat, and a few drops of nitric
acid added, and dissolved in hydrochloric acid, and the solution boiled and
filtered. If organs of the body are operated upon, iron and phosphoric acid
will be present in the ash; this will, indeed, be the case with most organic
substances. The filtered solution is boiled, and, while boiling, poured
into a strong solution of sodic hydrate contained in a silver or platinum
dish; the iron will now separate as oxide, and can be filtered off. To
the filtrate is added a little sodic phosphate; it is then feebly acidified
with hydrochloric acid, and ammonia added just sufficient to render it
alkaline; a light whitish cloud of alumina phosphate, should alumina be
present, is thrown down, and can be collected, thoroughly washed, dried,
ignited, and weighed as alumina phosphate.<a name="FNanchor_976" id="FNanchor_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a> The alumina phosphate is
then fused with sodic sulphate in a platinum dish or crucible, and the
fused mass treated with hot water; the sodic phosphate dissolves, and
the alumina oxide may be filtered off and dissolved in a little hydrochloric
acid or sulphuric acid.</p>

<h4>5. URANIUM.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><a name="Sect_900" id="Sect_900"></a>&sect; 900. <b>Uranium.</b>&mdash;The salts of uranium are intensely poisonous. The nitrate of
uranium is used in photography and the arts, and is a common reagent in chemical
laboratories.</p>

<p>According to Kowalewsky,<a name="FNanchor_977" id="FNanchor_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a> the acetate of uranium possesses an unusual power of
uniting with albumin; the other soluble uranium salts act also in a similar way.
Hence concentrated solutions of uranium salts corrode the mucous membranes, transforming,
for example, the walls of the stomach into a dead uranic albuminate. If
a non-corrosive salt of uranium is injected subcutaneously, glycosuria is produced,
with fatty degeneration of the walls of the blood-vessels, and fatty changes in the
kidneys, liver, &amp;c. The animal wastes and ultimately dies; 0&middot;5 to 2&middot;0 mgrms. of <span class="chemform">UO<sub>3</sub></span>
per kilogrm. will kill a cat, dog, or rabbit, if injected subcutaneously. The nitrate

<h4>Barium.</h4>

<p><a name="Sect_902" id="Sect_902"></a>&sect; 902. The soluble salts of barium are undoubtedly poisonous, and are
of frequent occurrence in the arts. The chloride of barium is used in the
staining of wool, the nitrate and the chlorate in the green fires of the
pyrotechnist, the oxide and the carbonate in the manufacture of glass.
The chromate is used by artists under the name of &#8220;yellow ultramarine,&#8221;
while the sulphate, technically known as &#8220;permanent white,&#8221; is, on
account of its weight and cheapness, occasionally used as an adulterant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680">[680]</a></span>
of white powders and other substances. Barium sulphide, under various
names, such as Bottcher&#8217;s depilatory, Thompson&#8217;s hair destroyer, <i>Poudre

<p><a name="Sect_906" id="Sect_906"></a>&sect; 906. <b>Effects of the Soluble Salts of Barium on Animals.</b>&mdash;One of
the early notices of the poisonous characters of barium compounds was
by James Watt,<a name="FNanchor_979" id="FNanchor_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a> who found that <i>witherite</i>, given to dogs, produced
vomiting, diarrh&#339;a, and death in a few hours. Sir Benj. Brodie<a name="FNanchor_980" id="FNanchor_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a>
administered barium chloride, and noticed its paralysing effect on the
heart. Orfila<a name="FNanchor_981" id="FNanchor_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a> made several experiments, and observed that 4 grms. of
the carbonate produced death in dogs in periods varying from one to five
hours; but in these experiments the gullet was tied. The later investigators<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_681" id="Page_681">[681]</a></span>
have been Gmelin, Onsum, Cyon, and B&ouml;hm.<a name="FNanchor_982" id="FNanchor_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a> Gmelin found
barium carbonate and barium chloride act in a very similar manner;
and, indeed, it is improbable that barium carbonate, <i>as</i> carbonate, has
any action, but, when swallowed, the hydrochloric and other acids of the
stomach form with it soluble compounds. J. Onsum made eight experiments
with both barium carbonate and chloride on animals. The respiration
was quickened and, at the same time, made weak and shallow; the
heart&#8217;s action was accelerated; the animals became restless: and there
was great muscular prostration, with paralytic symptoms; convulsions
did not occur in any one of the eight animals. He found, on <i>post-mortem</i>
examination, the right side of the heart full of blood from backward
engorgement; he describes a plugging of the small arteries with
little fibrinous coagula, having an inorganic nucleus, with constant
h&aelig;morrhagic extravasations. Onsum seems to have held the theory that
the baryta salts circulated in the blood, and then formed insoluble compounds,
which were arrested in the lungs, causing minute emboli, just in
the same way as if a finely-divided solid were introduced directly into
the circulation by the jugular vein.</p>

<p>Onsum stands alone in this view. Cyon found no emboli in the lungs,
and refers the toxic effect to a paralysing influence on the heart and
voluntary muscles, and also on the spinal cord. Cyon, to settle the
embolic theory, injected into the one jugular vein of a rabbit barium
chloride, and into the other sodic sulphate, but the small arteries and
capillaries of the lungs remained clear. B&ouml;hm, operating on frogs, found
a great similarity between the action of small doses of barium salts and
that of certain organic poisons; as, for example, cicutoxin, &middot;012 to &middot;02
grm. subcutaneously injected into frogs, acted as a heart-poison. So also
Blake<a name="FNanchor_983" id="FNanchor_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a> found the heart slowed, and concluded that barium chloride had
a direct action on the cardiac muscle, and also a toxic influence on the
nervous system. F. A. Falck, in experiments on rabbits, found a great
reduction of temperature after poisoning with barium chloride (3&deg; to

<p><a name="Sect_907" id="Sect_907"></a>&sect; 907. <b>Effects of the Salts of Barium on Man.</b>&mdash;There were about
fifteen cases of poisoning by barium salts on record by the end of 1883&mdash;three
of which were suicidal, but most of them were due to accident or
mistake. In three cases, barium chloride was taken instead of Glauber&#8217;s
salts; in one, instead of Carlsbad salts; in another, a mixture of barium
nitrate and sulphur, instead of pure sulphur; in a sixth case, a mixture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682">[682]</a></span>
of barium acetate and raspberry syrup, instead of sodic ethylsulphate; in
a seventh, a chemist put a larger dose than was ordered by the prescription;
and in four cases barium carbonate had been mixed with flour, and
this flour used in the making of pastry. Of the fifteen cases, nine, or 60
per cent., proved fatal; the fifteen cases have now (1894) been increased
to twenty-six.</p>

<p><b>Fatal Dose.</b>&mdash;The recorded cases of poisoning have not satisfactorily
settled the question as to the least fatal dose of the barium salts.
6&middot;5 grms. (about 100 grains) of the chloride have destroyed the life
of an adult woman in fifteen hours; 14 grms. (<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> oz.) of the nitrate of
baryta have killed a man in six and a half hours; and the carbonate
of baryta has destroyed a person in the relatively small dose of 3&middot;8 grms.
(60 grains). On the other hand, certain Continental physicians have prescribed
barium chloride in large medicinal doses; for example, Pirondi<a name="FNanchor_984" id="FNanchor_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a>
and Lisfranc<a name="FNanchor_985" id="FNanchor_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a> have gradually raised the dose of barium chloride from
4 decigrams up to 3 grms. (48 grains) daily, given, of course, in divided

bad effect.</p>

distinguished from the action of the absorbed salts. Kobert divides the
symptoms into seven groups:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1) Local, consisting in <i>malaise</i>, nausea, salivation, vomiting, and pain
in the stomach. This group merges so much into the next as hardly to
admit of precise separation.</p>

<p>(2) Excitation of the alimentary canal, both of the nervous and muscular
apparatus. Hence vomiting, painful colic, and acute diarrh&#339;a. All
these phenomena may be produced in animals by subcutaneous injection,
and, therefore, do not depend alone upon local action.</p>

<p>(3) Excitation of the brain motor centres, which leads to convulsions,
or may result in paralysis. About half the recorded cases of barium
poisoning in the human subject have been convulsed; the other half
paralysed. In one case mania resulted.</p>

<p>(4) Weakness or destruction of the power of muscular contraction;
this produces in frogs, when the muscular test movements are recorded
graphically, a veratrin-like convulsion curve. In the human subject the
effect is that of great muscular weakness.</p>

<p>(5) Digitalin-like influence on the heart and blood-vessels, showing
itself in great slowing of the pulse, pr&aelig;cordial anxiety, and strong beating
of the heart (not only sensible to the patient, but which can be heard
and felt by the bystanders). The arteries are incompressible and rigid,
the blood-pressure strikingly raised. The blood-vessels of old people do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_683" id="Page_683">[683]</a></span>
not stand the pressure, hence h&aelig;morrhages in the lungs, stomach, and
other organs. Frogs die with the heart in systole.</p>

<p>(6)  Catarrhal affection of the conjunctiva, the mucous membrane of
the respiratory tract, and the nose.</p>

<p>(7)  Formation of insoluble baryta salts in the blood-vessels, according to
Onsum. This has not been observed in man, and the fact is disputed (see <i>ante</i>).</p>

<p>In Dr. Tidy&#8217;s case,<a name="FNanchor_986" id="FNanchor_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a> in which a man, suffering from rheumatism, but
otherwise healthy, took a mixture of barium nitrate, flowers of sulphur,
and potassic chlorate, instead of sulphur, the symptoms were blisters on
the tongue, a burning pain in the gullet and stomach, with vomiting,
diarrh&#339;a, convulsions, aphonia, and coldness of the extremities. A case,
copiously detailed by Seidel,<a name="FNanchor_987" id="FNanchor_987"></a><a href="#Footnote_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a> in which a pregnant woman, twenty-eight
years old, took carbonate of baryta for the purpose of self-destruction, is
interesting. She probably took the poison some little time before six in
the evening; she vomited and had great pain in the stomach, but slept
during the night without further sickness. The next morning, after
drinking some coffee, the sickness was renewed; nevertheless, at 7 <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span>,
she repaired to her employment, which was distant an hour&#8217;s walk; she
probably suffered much on the way, for she did not arrive until 9 <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span>
The vomiting, accompanied by diarrh&#339;a, continuing, she was sent to bed
at 2 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span> She was very cold, and complained of great weakness; the
vomiting now ceased. At 8 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span> she shivered violently, could scarcely
swallow, and the respiration was oppressed. At 11 she seemed a little
improved; but at 3 <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span> she was found much worse, breathing rapidly,
but fully conscious; at 4 <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span> she was again seen, but found dead; she
thus lived about thirty-four hours after taking the fatal dose.</p>

that, after repeated injection of insoluble barium sulphate into the veins
of rabbits, barium is to be found in the liver, kidneys, spleen, and spinal

a similar series of experiments, but with the more soluble carbonate, and
this salt was injected into animals for a period of thirty days. All the

traces, the liver rather more, the kidneys, brain, and spinal cord still more,
and, lastly, the bones a considerable quantity, as much as 0&middot;056 per cent.</p>

disease of both liver and stomach, it is not clear that this is to
be attributed entirely to poison. In the case of suicide just detailed, the

there were also ecchymoses in the duodenum.</p>

<p><a name="Sect_911" id="Sect_911"></a>&sect; 911. <b>The Separation of Barium Salts from Organic Solids or
Fluids, and their Identification.</b>&mdash;In the usual course of examination of
an unknown substance, the matter will already have been extracted by
hydrochloric acid, and the solution successively treated with hydric and
ammonic sulphides. The filtrate from any precipitate, after being boiled,
would in such a case give a precipitate if treated with sulphuric acid,
should a salt of barium soluble in hydrochloric acid be present.</p>

<p>If there, however, should be <i>special</i> grounds to search for baryta in
particular, it is best to extract the substances with pure boiling water, to
concentrate the solution, and then add sulphuric acid, collecting any precipitate
which may form. If the latter is found to be sulphate of baryta,
it must be derived from some soluble salt, such as the nitrate or the
chloride. The substances which have been exhausted with water are
now treated with hydrochloric acid, and to the acid filtrate sulphuric acid
is added. If sulphate of baryta is thrown down, the baryta present must
have been a salt, insoluble in water, soluble in acids&mdash;probably the
carbonate. Lastly, the organic substances may be burnt to an ash, the
ash fused with carbonate of soda, the mass, when cool, dissolved in <span class="chemform">HCl</span>,
and the solution precipitated with sulphuric acid. Any baryta now
obtained was present, probably in the form of sulphate; nevertheless, if
obtained from the tissues, it would prove that a soluble salt had been
administered, for (so far as is known) sulphate of barium is not taken up
by the animal fluids, and is innocuous.</p>

<p>The sulphate of barium is identified as follows:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1)  A part of the well-washed precipitate is boiled with distilled water,
filtered, and to the filtrate a solution of chloride of barium added. If
there is no precipitate, the sulphate can be none other than baric
sulphate, for all the rest, without exception, are soluble enough to give a
slight cloud with baric chloride.</p>

<p>(2)  The sulphate may be changed into sulphide by ignition on charcoal,
the sulphide treated with HCl, the solution evaporated to dryness, and
the resulting chloride examined spectroscopically; or, the sulphide may
be mixed with chloride of calcium, taken up on a loop of platinum wire,
heated strongly in the flame of a Bunsen burner, and the flame examined
by the spectroscope.</p>

<p>(3)  A solution of the chloride of barium obtained from (2) gives
a yellow precipitate with neutral chromate of potash, insoluble in water,
but soluble in nitric acid.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX.</h2>

<h3>Treatment by Antidotes or otherwise of Cases of Poisoning.</h3>

<p><a name="Sect_912" id="Sect_912"></a>&sect; 912. All medical men in practice are liable to be summoned hastily
to cases of poisoning. In such emergencies not a moment is to be lost,
for valuable lives have ere this been sacrificed simply from the delay
caused by searching for medicines and instruments, and visiting the
patient unprovided with suitable remedies. Hence it is far the safest
plan for every medical man to provide himself with an &#8220;<i>antidote
bag</i>,&#8221; which, to be complete, should be furnished with the following
requisites:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<h4 class="h4app">I. <span class="smcap">Instruments</span>:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></h4>

<p>(1.) A <b>stomach-pump</b> or <b>tube</b>,<a name="FNanchor_990" id="FNanchor_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a> with proper mouth gags.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_990" id="Footnote_990"></a><a href="#FNanchor_990"><span class="label">[990]</span></a> The stomach-tube is simply a tube of india-rubber, from 6 to 8
feet in length, one end of which should be a little stiff, and have a
solid rounded extremity pierced with two lateral oval
holes&mdash;catheter-like; but, on an emergency, any india-rubber tube of a
suitable length will do. It is used by passing the proper end gently
down the throat into the stomach; if the patient is insensible, or, as
in some determined suicides, obstinate, the jaws must be forcibly opened
by the handle of a spoon, and some solid substance placed between the
teeth so as to give sufficient room for the entry of the tube. If the
tube is now passed in the median line well into the grasp of the
pharynx, it is actually drawn down into the stomach by the pharyngeal
muscles, so that the operator has, as it were, only to &#8220;pay out&#8221; a
sufficient quantity of the tubing. Holding the tube in a perpendicular
position, it may then be filled with water by means of a small funnel.
When full, the end must be pinched and brought down to the ground to
deliver in a basin; it will then act as a syphon and the contents of the
stomach will be syphoned off. The tube is elevated again above the body,
and the stomach filled with water; this syphoned off, and the process
repeated. Coffee, also, or antidotes may be conveniently introduced. If
the recumbent position is necessary, the patient must, of course, be
placed on a bed or table, in order that there should be sufficient fall
for the syphon.</p>

</div><!--fn-->

<hr class="footnote" />

<p>(2.) A <b>hypodermic syringe</b>.</p>

<p>(3.) An ordinary bleeding <b>lancet</b>.</p>

<p>(4.) A <b>glass-syringe</b> with suitable canula, which may, in case of
necessity, be used for transfusion.</p>

<p>(5.) <b>Bistoury</b>, <b>forceps</b> and <b>tubes</b> suitable for performing <b>tracheotomy</b>.</p>

<p>A small <b>battery</b> (interrupted current).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_686" id="Page_686">[686]</a></span></p>

<h4 class="h4app">II. <span class="smcap">Emetics</span>:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></h4>

<p>(1.) <i>Sulphate of zinc.</i></p>

<p>(2.) <i>Apomorphine.</i></p>

<p>(3.) <i>Mustard.</i></p>

<p>(4.) <i>Ipecacuanha.</i></p>

<p>The <i>sulphate of zinc</i> may either be carried in 30-grain powders or
in the ordinary solid crystalline state, together with a little measure
made out of a small pill-box which, when exactly full, is found to contain
from 25 to 30 grains.</p>

<p>A still more convenient form is that of the compressed tablets, sold
as a speciality by one or more firms. The same remarks apply to
<i>ipecacuanha.</i></p>

<p>The <i>apomorphine hydrochlorate</i> should be in solution, a suitable
strength is 2 per cent.; a few drops of this substance, injected hypodermically,
will cause vomiting in a few minutes.</p>

<p>Besides the above list, the bag should be furnished with a selection of
the so-called antidotes.</p>

<h4 class="h4app">III. <span class="smcap">Antidotes</span>:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></h4>

<p>(<i>a.</i>) <i>Chemicals neutralising the poison.</i></p>

<p><b>Acetic acid</b> and <b>calcined magnesia</b>.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) <i>Precipitants of alkaloids.</i></p>

<p><b>Tannin</b>&mdash;A solution of <b>iodine in potassic iodide</b>.</p>

<p>(<i>c.</i>) <i>Narcotics, or an&aelig;sthetics,</i> for the treatment of the tetanic class.</p>

<p><b>Chloral</b>&mdash;chloroform.</p>

<p>(<i>d.</i>) <i>Substances which act physiologically.</i></p>

<p><b>French oil of turpentine.</b>&mdash;A solution of <b>atropine sulphate</b> for
hypodermic use (strength &middot;8 per cent.); hypodermic dose from 5 to 6
drops.</p>

<p>Solution of <b>nitrate of pilocarpine</b> (strength 5 per cent.); dose, 10
drops or more.</p>

<p><b>Muscarine</b>&mdash;a solution in water (strength 5 per cent.); dose, 10 drops.</p>

<p><b>Morphine meconate</b> in solution (strength 10 per cent.); dose, from
5 drops.</p>

<p>A solution of <b>nitrate of strychnine</b> (strength 2 per cent.); hypodermic
dose, from 2 to 3 drops.</p>

<p><b>Potassium Permanganate</b> in crystals.</p>

<p>To these may be added a bottle of <b>Wyeth&#8217;s dialysed iron</b> for use in
arsenic poisoning, a flask of <b>brandy</b>, some <b>chloric ether</b>, <b>aromatic
spirits of ammonia</b>, and some really good <b>extract of coffee</b>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_687" id="Page_687">[687]</a></span></p>

<h3>TREATMENT.</h3>

<p class="h4app"><a name="Sect_913" id="Sect_913"></a>&sect; 913. <span class="smcap">Acid Carbolic.</span></p>

<p>Use the <b>stomach-tube</b> or <b>pump</b>, unless there is great destruction of
the mucous membrane. In the latter case, excite vomiting by injecting
subcutaneously from 5 to 6 drops of the <b>apomorphine</b> solution; or give
an emetic of <b>zinc sulphate</b>, <b>ipecacuanha</b>, or <b>mustard</b>.</p>

<p>The stomach may, by the aid of the tube, be washed out with a weak
alkaline solution of <b>soda</b>; <b>albumen</b> may also be given, and such
stimulants as <b>brandy</b> and <b>water</b>, <b>chloric ether</b>, and <b>aromatic spirits of
ammonia</b>.</p>

<p>It is important to apply warmth to the extremities.</p>

<p>Inject subcutaneously from 2 to 3 drops of the <b>atropine hypodermic</b>
solution.</p>

<p><b>Nitrite of amyl</b> by inhalation is said to have been useful.</p>

<p>In desperate cases <b>bleeding</b>, followed by <b>transfusion</b>, is to be considered.</p>

<p class="h4app"><a name="AppAcids" id="AppAcids"></a><span class="smcap">Acids&mdash;Mineral</span>, including <span class="smcap">Sulphuric</span>, <span class="smcap">Nitric</span>, <span class="smcap">Hydrochloric</span>, <span class="smcap">Glacial
Acetic Acids</span>.</p>

<p><b>Stomach-tube</b> or <b>pump</b>, inadmissible.</p>

<p>Neutralise by calcined <b>magnesia</b>, <b>lime</b>, <b>chalk</b>, or <b>soda,</b> but not with
potash, if there is choice.</p>

<p>If no neutralising agent can be immediately procured, then dilute with
plenty of water.</p>

<p>Other remedies are&mdash;<b>oil</b>, <b>milk</b>, <b>white of eggs</b>, <b>gruel</b>.</p>

<p>It is often recommended in such cases to administer hypodermically
a little <b>morphine</b>.</p>

<p class="h4app"><a name="AppAconite" id="AppAconite"></a><span class="smcap">Aconite&mdash;Aconitine.</span></p>

<p>Use at once the <b>stomach-tube</b> or <b>pump</b>, or give emetics of <b>sulphate
of zinc</b>, or hypodermic solution of <b>apomorphine</b>.</p>

<p>Keep the patient in the recumbent posture.</p>

<p>After the stomach has been emptied, give <b>atropine</b>, either by hypodermic
injection or by the mouth, say 4 drops of the P.B. solution;
failing atropine, 20 drops of the tincture of <b>belladonna</b>. The dose may
be repeated more or less frequently according to the condition of the
patient.</p>

<p>If there is great tendency to heart-syncope, tincture of <b>digitalis</b> in
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>-drachm doses by the mouth, or in hypodermic doses of from 10 drops
upwards.</p>

<p>Apply a mustard poultice to the pericardium; aid vomiting and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_688" id="Page_688">[688]</a></span>
elimination of the poison by plenty of water, to which may be added
brandy or any form of alcohol.</p>

<p>Inhalations of <b>nitrite of amyl</b> are said to have been useful. If the
breathing stops, try <b>artificial respiration</b>.</p>

<p class="h4app"><span class="smcap">Alcohol.</span></p>

<p>Empty the stomach by the <b>tube</b> or <b>pump</b>, and then wash it out with
warm coffee; if the stomach-tube is not at hand, then empty the stomach
by hypodermic injection of 5 drops of <b>apomorphine</b>, or by a <b>mustard</b>
emetic, or <b>sulphate of zinc</b>. Keep the body very warm, but the cold
<b>douche</b> may be applied to the head.</p>

<p>Endeavours should be made to rouse the patient, if insensible, by
shaking, shouting at him, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Inhalations of <b>amyl nitrite</b> are said to be useful.</p>

<p class="h4app"><a name="AppAlkalies" id="AppAlkalies"></a><span class="smcap">Alkalies&mdash;Ammonia&mdash;Potash&mdash;Soda.</span>&mdash;<b>Stomach-pump</b> or <b>tube</b> not to
be used.</p>

<p>Vomiting nearly always present, or may be produced by administering
plenty of lukewarm water; after which give <b>dilute vinegar</b>, or the
juice of <b>lemons</b> or <b>oranges</b>; <b>olive oil</b>, the <b>white of eggs</b>, <b>barley
water</b>, <b>arrowroot</b>, and always plenty of <b>water</b> may be administered.</p>

<p>There may be &#339;dema of the glottis, especially if ammonia has been
taken. In such a case, and death threatening from suffocation, perform
<b>tracheotomy</b>. In poisoning by ammonia, with croupous respiration,
keep the room warm, and fill it with steam by means of a bronchitis
kettle.</p>

<p>Relieve pain by small doses of <b>morphine</b> injected subcutaneously.</p>

<p class="h4app"><span class="smcap">Ammonia.</span>&mdash;See <span class="smcap"><a href="#AppAlkalies">Alkalies</a></span>.</p>

<p class="h4app"><a name="AppAntimony" id="AppAntimony"></a><span class="smcap">Antimony&mdash;Tartar-Emetic&mdash;Antimonial Wine, &amp;c.</span></p>

<p>The stomach will generally have been emptied by vomiting. In those
rare cases in which this does not take place, use the <b>stomach-pump</b> or
<b>tube</b>, or give hypodermic injection of <b>apomorphine</b>.</p>

<p>Follow this with doses of <b>strong tea</b>, or give half-a-drachm of <b>tannin</b>
or <b>gallic acid</b> in warm water.</p>

<p>Give also demulcent drinks, and stimulants in small doses, frequently
repeated.</p>

<p>Keep the patient very warm by hot blankets and wraps.</p>

<p>The interrupted galvanic current to the heart may be useful.</p>

<p class="h4app"><span class="smcap">Apocynin.</span>&mdash;See <span class="smcap"><a href="#AppDigitalis">Digitalis</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689">[689]</a></span></p>

<p class="h4app"><span class="smcap">Arsenic.</span></p>

<p>Use the <b>stomach-pump</b> or <b>tube</b>, or empty stomach by emetics, such
as hypodermic solution of <b>apomorphine</b>, or give <b>mustard</b> or <b>sulphate
of zinc</b>. The stomach should then be washed out by large quantities of
water, most conveniently administered by the pump or tube.</p>

<p>If the tube or pump is not at hand, then administer at once either
<b>dialysed iron</b>, or the freshly-precipitated <b>hydrated oxide of iron</b>,
obtained by precipitating the ordinary perchloride by means of carbonate
of soda or ammonia, avoiding excess of the latter. If the operator has
sufficient chemical knowledge to precipitate the iron with fair exactness,
so that there is no great excess of ammonia, or of sodic carbonate, then
filtration is unnecessary. In other cases, filter through a handkerchief.</p>

<p><b>Oil</b>, <b>mucilaginous drinks</b>, the <b>white of eggs</b>, and, if faintness exists,
small doses of <b>stimulants</b> may all be given.</p>

<p>If the skin is cold, warmth must be applied to the body by means of
hot blankets, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Pain may be relieved by <b>morphine</b>.</p>

<p class="h4app"><a name="AppAtropine" id="AppAtropine"></a><span class="smcap">Atropine&mdash;Belladonna&mdash;Tincture of Belladonna.</span></p>

<p>Empty the stomach by means of the <b>stomach-pump</b> or <b>tube</b>.</p>

<p>Give an enema of <b>coffee</b>.</p>

<p>Administer half a grain of <b>pilocarpine nitrate</b>; or, if that is not at
hand, <b>morphine</b> or <b>opium</b> in suitable doses will act to a certain extent
antagonistic to the poison.</p>

<p>A subcutaneous dose of <b>muscarine</b> may be administered instead of
pilocarpine, but is not quite so good.</p>

<p>Hot water to the feet, alternate <b>douches</b> of cold and hot water are
found useful.</p>

<p>If the respiration seems likely to stop, <b>artificial respiration</b> must be
practised.</p>

<p class="h4app"><span class="smcap">Belladonna.</span>&mdash;See <span class="smcap"><a href="#AppAtropine">Atropine</a></span>.</p>

<p class="h4app"><span class="smcap">Benzene.</span></p>

<p>If swallowed, then empty the stomach by <b>pump</b> or <b>tube</b>, or by the
hypodermic injection of <b>apomorphine</b>; or give emetics, such as <b>zinc
sulphate</b>, <b>mustard</b>, or <b>ipecacuanha</b>.</p>

<p>If the vapour has been <i>inhaled</i>, this is unnecessary.</p>

<p>Plenty of <b>fresh air</b>.</p>

<p>A subcutaneous dose of <b>atropine</b>, say 1-60th of a grain, or from 30 to
40 drops of <b>belladonna</b> tincture.</p>

<p>Alternate <b>douches</b> of hot and cold water to the chest, <b>artificial

<p class="h4app"><a name="AppCalabar" id="AppCalabar"></a><span class="smcap">Calabar Bean&mdash;Physostigmine</span>.</p>

<p>Use <b>stomach-pump</b> or <b>tube</b>, or emetics, such as <b>sulphate of zinc</b>,
<b>mustard</b>, or <b>ipecacuanha</b>; or, better still, hypodermic solution of
<b>apomorphine</b>.</p>

<p>Give hypodermic doses of 1-60th grain <b>atropine</b> until the pupils
dilate. This treatment seeming to fail, <b>chloral</b> in 10-grain doses, every
quarter of an hour, has been recommended.</p>

<p>In certain cases <b>strychnine</b> has been used in hypodermic doses of

<p><b>Stimulants</b> and <b>artificial respiration</b> will probably be necessary in
some cases.</p>

<p class="h4app"><span class="smcap">Camphor.</span></p>

<p>Use <b>stomach-pump</b> or <b>tube</b>, or empty the stomach by emetics.</p>

seem to be the best methods of treatment.</p>

<p class="h4app"><span class="smcap">Cantharides&mdash;Cantharidine.</span></p>

<p>Use <b>stomach-pump</b> or <b>tube</b>, if the mucous membrane of the throat is
not inflamed; or, administer hypodermic dose of <b>apomorphine</b>, or give

or <b>mustard</b>, or <b>ipecacuanha.</b></p>

<p>An <b>enema of coffee</b> will be useful.</p>

<p>Keep the limbs warm.</p>

<p>Administer hypodermically 2 or 3 drops of the solution of <b>strychnine</b>
at intervals of from fifteen to twenty minutes.</p>

<p>Rouse the patient by various means, such as shouting, shaking,
flapping the skin with a wet towel, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Inhalations of <b>amyl nitrite</b> are recommended.</p>

<p><b>Artificial respiration</b> may be necessary.</p>

theoretically, to act as a chemical antidote to potassium cyanide, by
checking the paralysis of the respiratory centres, has performed some
experiments. Rabbits were shown to be fatally affected in a few minutes
by 0&middot;01 grm. of the poison, but if, at the time of administration, 0&middot;5
grm. of permanganate dissolved in 50 c.c. of water was also introduced
into the stomach, doses of cyanide up to 0&middot;1 grm. failed to cause death.
Larger quantities (0&middot;2 grm.) proved fatal under similar conditions, but
the action of the poison was much delayed. Successful experiments were
also performed with aqueous solutions of hydrocyanic acid containing 0&middot;1
per cent. It is suggested, therefore, that, in cases of cyanide
poisoning, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub class="tab">2</sub> to <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub class="tab">3</sub> litre of a 3 to 5 per cent. solution of

snakes, death threatening, the only likely means of saving life would
be bleeding at one arm and <b>transfusing</b> blood by the other.</p>

<p><b>Ammonia</b> may be given by the mouth, and also smelt.</p>

<p>In cobra poisoning and venoms which kill mainly through the respiration,
the breathing must be kept up artificially; and, should there be
signs of the heart failing, weak, interrupted <b>galvanic</b> shocks may be
applied to the walls of the chest.</p>

<p>Lacerda&#8217;s plan of injecting permanganate of potash under the skin
is not alone useless but mischievous, for it takes up time which might be
more valuably employed.</p>

<p>Empty the stomach as quickly as possible by an emetic of <b>mustard</b>, or
<b>zinc sulphate</b>, or by a hypodermic solution of <b>apomorphine</b> (4 drops).</p>

<p>The <b>stomach-pump</b> or <b>tube</b> inadmissible; for, if tetanus is present, it
cannot be applied; or, if absent, it is likely to excite a spasm.</p>

<p>Place patient at once under <b>chloroform</b> or <b>ether</b>, and keep up a gentle
narcosis for several hours, if necessary.</p>

<p>Darken the room, stifle all noise; if in a town, and opportunity permit,
have straw or peat placed at once before the house to deaden noise.</p>

<p>If the spasms threaten the respiration, <b>artificial respiration</b> is
absolutely necessary; and, to facilitate this, it would be justifiable, in a
dangerous case, to perform <b>tracheotomy</b>, of course under chloroform.</p>

<p><b>Chloral</b> may be given in place of chloroform, but the latter is best;
the dose of <b>chloral</b> should be, at least, half a drachm, and if no effect is
produced in half an hour, then doses of 20 grains should be given at
intervals of a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>If neither chloroform nor chloral is at hand, the juice from a recently-smoked
pipe may be diffused in a little water and a few drops injected
subcutaneously, and the effect watched. If there is a marked improvement
the treatment may be persevered in.</p>

<p><b>Bromide of potassium</b> in combination with chloral has been recommended.</p>

<p><b>Nitrite of amyl</b> inhalations are said to be of use.</p>

<p><b>Curarine</b> in a subcutaneous dose of one-third of a grain is antagonistic
so far that it paralyses the voluntary muscles.</p>

3 or 4 drops of the solution of apomorphine.</p>

<p class="h4app"><a name="AppZinc" id="AppZinc"></a><span class="smcap">Zinc.</span></p>

<p>The only salt likely to cause poisonous symptoms is the chloride,
which is used in the arts, and is the active principle of Burnett&#8217;s disinfecting
fluid.</p>

<p><b>Stomach-pump</b> or <b>tube</b> inadmissible. Give plenty of <b>water</b>, in which
<b>carbonate of soda</b> is dissolved; or, if that is not at hand, <b>carbonate of
potash</b>.</p>

<p><b>Eggs</b> and <b>milk</b> should also be given.</p>

<p>Solutions of <b>tannin</b>, strong <b>tea</b>, and the like, also, to some extent,
neutralise the poison.</p>

<p>The pain in the abdomen is to be allayed in the usual way&mdash;by hot
fomentations and small frequent doses of <b>morphine</b> or <b>opium</b>.</p>

<h3>DOMESTIC READY REMEDIES FOR POISONING.</h3>

<p><a name="Sect_914" id="Sect_914"></a>&sect; 914. Large households, more especially those in which no one
possesses any special medical knowledge, would do well to furnish an
<span class="smcapall">ANTIDOTE CUPBOARD</span>, for use in cases of emergency. This cupboard may
contain:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1.) <i>The Multiple Antidote</i>, which consists of saturated solution of
sulphate of iron 100 parts, water 800, magnesia 88, animal charcoal 44
parts. It is best to have the animal charcoal and magnesia mixed
together in the dry state and kept in a well-corked bottle; when required
for use, the saturated solution of sulphate of iron is mixed with eight
times its bulk of water, and the mixture of charcoal and magnesia added
with constant stirring. The multiple antidote may be given in wine-glassful
doses, frequently repeated, in poisoning by arsenic, zinc, opium,
digitalis, mercury, or strychnine; it is of no use in phosphorus poisoning,
or in poisoning by the caustic alkalies or antimony.</p>

<p>(2.) <i>Calcined Magnesia</i>, for use in poisoning by acids.</p>

<p>(3.) <i>French Turpentine</i>, for poisoning by phosphorus.</p>

<p>(4.) Powdered ipecacuanha in a well-corked bottle; the bottle containing
a small pill-box which is cut down, so that when full it contains
30 grains&mdash;the proper dose as an emetic. A similar small supply of
sulphate of zinc may also be provided.</p>

<p>(5.) A tin of mustard.</p>

<p>(6.) A bottle of vinegar.</p>

<p>If, then, provided with such a supply, any member is known to have
taken poison, and yet the precise poison is not known, give a <b>sulphate
of zinc</b> or <b>ipecacuanha emetic</b>, and follow it up by the <b>multiple antidote</b>,
which is in itself not poisonous.</p>

<p>If <span class="smcap">Phosphorus</span> has been taken, then give the <b>French turpentine</b> as
directed under Phosphorus (<a href="#Page_697">p. 697</a>).</p>

<p>If <span class="smcap">Acids</span>, neutralise by the <b>calcined magnesia</b> (see Acids, mineral,
<a href="#Page_687">p. 687</a>).</p>

<p>If <span class="smcap">Alkalies</span>, neutralise with <b>vinegar</b> (see Alkalies, <a href="#Page_688">p. 688</a>).</p>

<p>&#8258; Since its first appearance in 1880, Prof. <span class="smcap">Landois&#8217; Text-Book of
Physiology</span> has been translated into three Foreign languages, and passed
through <span class="smcap">Seven Large Editions</span>.</p>

<p>The Fourth English Edition has again been thoroughly revised, and a
new feature introduced&mdash;that of printing some of the Illustrations in Colours.
The number of figures has also been largely increased, from 494 in the First,
to 845 in the present Edition. In order to do full justice to the coloured
illustrations, and to admit of more of the text being printed in large type, it
has been found necessary to put the work once again in two volumes.</p>

<p class="center sstype">Opinions of the Press.</p>

<p class="fsize80">&#8220;So great are the advantages offered by Prof. <span class="smcap">Landois&#8217; Text-book</span>, from the <span class="smcapall">EXHAUSTIVE</span>
and <span class="smcapall">EMINENTLY PRACTICAL</span> manner in which the subject is treated, that it has passed
through FOUR large editions in the same number of years. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Dr. <span class="smcap">Stirling</span>&#8217;s

<p><span class="smcap">Professor M&#8217;Call Anderson</span>&#8217;s Treatise, affording, as it does, a
complete <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of the best modern practice, is written&mdash;not from the

both in private and in hospital practice, with unusual opportunities
for studying this class of disease, hence the <span class="smcapall">PRACTICAL</span> and <span class="smcapall">CLINICAL</span>
directions given are of great value.</p>

<p>Speaking of the practical aspects of Dr. <span class="smcap">Anderson</span>&#8217;s work, the
<i>British Medical Journal</i> says:&mdash;&#8220;Skin diseases are, as is well known,
obstinate and troublesome, and the knowledge that there are <span class="smcapall">ADDITIONAL
RESOURCES</span> besides those in ordinary use will give confidence
to many a puzzled medical man, and enable him to encourage a
doubting patient. <span class="smcap">Almost any page might be used to illustrate
the fulness of the work in this respect.</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The chapter
on Eczema, that universal and most troublesome ailment, describes
in a comprehensive spirit, and with the greatest accuracy of detail,
the various methods of treatment. Dr. Anderson writes with the
authority of a man who has tried the remedies which he discusses,
and the information and advice which he gives cannot fail to prove
extremely valuable.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fsize80">&#8220;Professor M&#8217;Call Anderson has produced a work likely to prove <span class="smcapall">VERY ACCEPTABLE</span> to the
busy practitioner. The sections on treatment are very full. For example, <span class="smcap">Eczema</span> has 110 pages
given to it, and 73 of these pages are devoted to treatment.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Lancet.</i></p>

<p class="fsize80">&#8220;Beyond doubt, the <span class="smcapall">MOST IMPORTANT WORK</span> on Skin Diseases that has appeared in England
for many years. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Conspicuous for the <span class="smcapall">AMOUNT AND EXCELLENCE</span> of the <span class="smcapall">CLINICAL AND
PRACTICAL</span> information which it contains.&#8221;&mdash;<i>British Medical Journal.</i></p>

<p class="fsize80">&#8220;The work may be regarded as a storehouse of <span class="smcapall">FACTS</span> gathered and sifted by one whose
opinion is entitled to the highest respect, and we have no hesitation in stating our belief that
it has <span class="smcapall">NO EQUAL</span> in this country.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Edinburgh Medical Journal.</i></p>

<p class="fsize80">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Essentially</span> a useful book, clear and graphic in description, dogmatic and hopeful on

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The particular features that will most commend Dr. Meyer&#8217;s work
to English readers are&mdash;its <span class="smcapall">CONCISENESS</span>, its <span class="smcapall">HELPFULNESS</span> in explanation,
and the <span class="smcapall">PRACTICALITY</span> of its directions. The best proof of its worth
may, perhaps, be seen in the fact that it has now gone through <i>three</i>
French and <i>four</i> German editions, and has been translated into most
European languages&mdash;Italian, Spanish, Russian, and Polish&mdash;and even
into Japanese.</p>

<p class="fsize80">&#8220;An <span class="smcap">excellent translation</span> of a standard French Text-Book. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We can cordially recommend
Dr. Meyer&#8217;s work. It is essentially a <span class="smcap">practical work</span>. The Publishers have done their part in the

<span class="fsize80">Master of Downing College, Cambridge.</span></p>

<p class="center fsize125"><b>CHIEF FEATURES OF DR. HILL&#8217;S NOTE-BOOK.</b></p>

<p><b>1. It helps the Student to CODIFY HIS KNOWLEDGE.</b></p>

<p><b>2. Gives a grasp of BOTH SIDES of an argument.</b></p>

<p><b>3. Is INDISPENSABLE for RAPID RECAPITULATION.</b></p>

<p class="fsize80"><i>The Lancet</i> says of it:&mdash;&#8220;The work which the Master of Downing College modestly compares to a Note-book
is an <span class="smcapall">ADMIRABLE COMPENDIUM</span> of our present information .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. will be a <span class="smcapall">REAL ACQUISITION</span> to Students .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. gives
all <span class="smcapall">ESSENTIAL POINTS</span>. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The <span class="smcapall">TYPOGRAPHICAL ARRANGEMENT</span> is a chief feature of the book. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Secures at a glance the <span class="smcapall">EVIDENCE</span> on both sides of a theory.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fsize80"><i>The Hospital</i> says:&mdash;&#8220;The Physiologist&#8217;s Note-book bears the hall-mark of the Cambridge School, and
is the work of one of the most successful of her teachers. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Will be <span class="smcapall">INVALUABLE</span> to students.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fsize80"><i>The British Medical Journal</i> commends in the volume&mdash;&#8220;Its admirable diagrams, its running bibliography,
its clear Tables, and its concise statement of the anatomical aspects of the subject.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="fsize80">&#8220;If a Student could rely on remembering every word which he had ever heard or read,
such a book as this would be unnecessary; but experience teaches that he constantly needs
to recall the form of an argument and to make sure of the proper <b>classification of his facts</b>,
although he does not need a second time to follow the author up all the short steps by which
the ascent was first made. With a view to rendering the book useful for rapid recapitulation,
I have endeavoured to strike out every word which was not essential to clearness, and thus,
without I hope falling into &#8216;telegram&#8217; English, to give the text the form which it may be
supposed to take in a well-kept Note-book; at the same time, space has been left for the
<b>introduction in MS.</b> of such additional facts and arguments as seem to the reader to bear
upon the subject-matter. For the same reason the drawings are reduced to <b>diagrams</b>.
All details which are not necessary to the comprehension of the principles of construction of
the apparatus or organ, as the case may be, are omitted, and it is hoped that the drawings
will, therefore, be easy to grasp, remember, and reproduce.</p>

<p class="fsize80">&#8220;As it is intended that the &#8216;Note-book&#8217; should be essentially a Student&#8217;s book, no
references are given to foreign literature or to recondite papers in English; but, on the other
hand, references are given to a number of <b>classical English memoirs</b>, as well as to descriptions
in text-books which appear to me to be particularly lucid, and the Student is strongly
recommended to study the passages and Papers referred to.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Extract from Author&#8217;s Preface.</i></p>

<p class="fsize80">&#8220;This valuable little manual. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The <span class="smcapall">GENERAL CONCEPTION</span> of the book is <span class="smcapall">EXCELLENT</span>; the

<p class="fsize80">&#8220;The Second Edition has been thoroughly worked up to date, and a large number of well-executed

supplement the course given by a Physiological Teacher.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Lancet.</i></p>

<p class="fsize80">&#8220;The student is enabled to perform for himself most of the experiments usually shown in

<p class="fsize80">&#8220;The general plan of the work is <span class="smcapall">ADMIRABLE</span>. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is very evident that the

<p class="fsize80">&#8220;In the fullest sense Mr. Humphry&#8217;s book is a <span class="smcapall">DISTINCT ADVANCE</span> on all previous

the bones and internal organs, by many Illustrations of the art of <span class="smcapall">BANDAGING</span>, by
Temperature charts indicative of the course of some of the most characteristic diseases,
and by a goodly array of <span class="smcap">Sick-room Appliances</span> with which <span class="smcap">every Nurse</span> should
endeavour to become acquainted.&#8221;&mdash;<i>British Medical Journal.</i></p>

<h2>Transcriber&#8217;s Notes</h2>

<p>This text follows the original work. Inconsistencies in spelling, hyphenation, capitalisation, etc. have been retained, except as
mentioned below. This applies to chemical compound names as well. Depending on the hard- and software used to read this text, not all
characters may display correctly or display at all.</p>

<p><b>Textual remarks:</b><br />
Page 13, Footnote [18], Jerome Cardan: also known as J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Cardan, Girolamo Cardano, Hieronymus Cardanus.<br />
Page 18, Praag van, Leonides: should be Leonides van Praag, Isidorus. This is the (enlarged) Dutch translation of Werber&#8217;s book.<br />
Page 52: reference to the separate article on (the detection of) Tin: there is no such article in the book.<br />
Page 62, footnote [55]: micro-millimetre should be micro-metre.<br />
Page 175, structural formulas: the original work gives two identical structural formulas; both are correct, but they do not show the
difference between the two compounds.<br />
Page 192, that of Borussica: possibly a typographical error for Borussia (Borussica is the adjective).<br />
Page 399, 18&middot;1 mgrms. (&middot;18 grain): at least one of the numbers is wrong (possibly the second number should be &middot;28).<br />
Page 507: 6&middot;4 mgmrs. (1 grain): this should probably be either 64 mgrms. or &middot;1 grain. In the context, the latter seems more
probable.<br />
Buchner/B&uuml;chner are different persons, both are spelled correctly.<br />
Hofman/Hoffman/Hofmann/Hoffmann, K&ouml;hler/Koehler, Lin&eacute;/Linn&eacute;, Pellagra/Pellagri, Schuchardt/Schuchart: possibly these
are spelling variants or typographical errors referring to the same persons.<br />
Kapferschlaeger: should possibly be Kupferschlaeger.<br />
Schauff&eacute;le should possibly be Schauffele or Sch&auml;uffele.<br />
The index has been left as in the original work, even though it is not always alphabetic.<br />
Advertisements: there are some references to pages 35 and 36 of the advertisements. These pages were not present in the original.</p>

<p><b>Changes made to the text</b><br />
Some minor obvious punctuation and typographical errors have been corrected silently. French accents and German umlauts have been added
or corrected where needed.<br />
Multi-page tables have been combined into single tables; many tables have been re-arranged.<br />
Structural formulas have been moved to separate lines.<br />
Some sections starting with &sect; were printed as section headers in the original work; they have been treated as regular numbered
sections here.<br />
Footnotes have been moved to under the paragraph, table, etc. they refer to.</p>
